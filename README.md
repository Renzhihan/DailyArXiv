| **[SeqFusion: Sequential Fusion of Pre-Trained Models for Zero-Shot Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02836v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike traditional time-series forecasting methods that require extensive in-task data for training, zero-shot forecasting can directly predict future values given a target time series without additional training data. Current zero-shot approaches primarily rely on pre-trained generalized models, with their performance often depending on the variety and relevance of the pre-training data, which can raise privacy concerns. Instead of collecting diverse pre-training data, we introduce SeqFusion in this work, a novel framework that collects and fuses diverse pre-trained models (PTMs) sequentially for zero-shot forecasting. Based on the specific temporal characteristics of the target time series, SeqFusion selects the most suitable PTMs from a batch of pre-collected PTMs, performs sequential predictions, and fuses all the predictions while using minimal data to protect privacy. Each of these PTMs specializes in different temporal patterns and forecasting tasks, allowing SeqFusion to select by measuring distances in a shared representation space of the target time series with each PTM. Experiments demonstrate that SeqFusion achieves competitive accuracy in zero-shot forecasting compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAAD-LLM: Adaptive Anomaly Detection Using LLMs and RAG Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02800v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in complex industrial environments poses unique challenges, particularly in contexts characterized by data sparsity and evolving operational conditions. Predictive maintenance (PdM) in such settings demands methodologies that are adaptive, transferable, and capable of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we present RAAD-LLM, a novel framework for adaptive anomaly detection, leveraging large language models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This approach addresses the aforementioned PdM challenges. By effectively utilizing domain-specific knowledge, RAAD-LLM enhances the detection of anomalies in time series data without requiring fine-tuning on specific datasets. The framework's adaptability mechanism enables it to adjust its understanding of normal operating conditions dynamically, thus increasing detection accuracy. We validate this methodology through a real-world application for a plastics manufacturing plant and the Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB). Results show significant improvements over our previous model with an accuracy increase from 70.7 to 89.1 on the real-world dataset. By allowing for the enriching of input series data with semantics, RAAD-LLM incorporates multimodal capabilities that facilitate more collaborative decision-making between the model and plant operators. Overall, our findings support RAAD-LLM's ability to revolutionize anomaly detection methodologies in PdM, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in how anomaly detection is implemented across various industries.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.00914</p></details> |
| **[Generating Quantum Reservoir State Representations with Random Matrices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07278v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate a novel approach to reservoir computation measurements using random matrices. We do so to motivate how atomic-scale devices could be used for real-world computational applications. Our approach uses random matrices to construct reservoir measurements, introducing a simple, scalable means of generating state representations. In our studies, two reservoirs, a five-atom Heisenberg spin chain and a five-qubit quantum circuit, perform time series prediction and data interpolation. The performance of the measurement technique and current limitations are discussed in detail, along with an exploration of the diversity of measurements provided by the random matrices. In addition, we explore the role of reservoir parameters such as coupling strength and measurement dimension, providing insight into how these learning machines could be automatically tuned for different problems. This research highlights the use of random matrices to measure simple quantum reservoirs for natural learning devices, and outlines a path forward for improving their performance and experimental realization.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Performance of Zero-Shot Time Series Foundation Models on Cloud Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12944v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a popular paradigm for zero-shot multi-domain forecasting. FMs are trained on numerous diverse datasets and claim to be effective forecasters across multiple different time series domains, including cloud data. In this work we investigate this claim, exploring the effectiveness of FMs on cloud data. We demonstrate that many well-known FMs fail to generate meaningful or accurate zero-shot forecasts in this setting. We support this claim empirically, showing that FMs are outperformed consistently by simple linear baselines. We also illustrate a number of interesting pathologies, including instances where FMs suddenly output seemingly erratic, random-looking forecasts. Our results suggest a widespread failure of FMs to model cloud data.</p></details> | 5 pages, Preprint |

However, there is limited understanding of how public audiences engage with these maps and extract essential information. Our study investigates the sensemaking of young, digitally native viewers as they interact with crisis maps. We integrate frameworks from the learning sciences and human-data interaction to explore sensemaking through two empirical studies: a thematic analysis of online comments from a New York Times series on graph comprehension, and interviews with 18 participants from German-speaking regions. Our analysis categorizes sensemaking activities into established clusters: inspecting, engaging with content, and placing, and introduces responding personally to capture the affective dimension. We identify friction points connected to these clusters, including struggles with color concepts, responses to missing context, lack of personal connection, and distrust, offering insights for improving crisis communication to public audiences.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Training a multilayer dynamical spintronic network with standard machine learning tools to perform time series classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02835v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to process time-series at low energy cost is critical for many applications. Recurrent neural network, which can perform such tasks, are computationally expensive when implementing in software on conventional computers. Here we propose to implement a recurrent neural network in hardware using spintronic oscillators as dynamical neurons. Using numerical simulations, we build a multi-layer network and demonstrate that we can use backpropagation through time (BPTT) and standard machine learning tools to train this network. Leveraging the transient dynamics of the spintronic oscillators, we solve the sequential digits classification task with $89.83\pm2.91~\%$ accuracy, as good as the equivalent software network. We devise guidelines on how to choose the time constant of the oscillators as well as hyper-parameters of the network to adapt to different input time scales.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[FNETS: Factor-adjusted network estimation and forecasting for high-dimensional time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06110v6)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose FNETS, a methodology for network estimation and forecasting of high-dimensional time series exhibiting strong serial- and cross-sectional correlations. We operate under a factor-adjusted vector autoregressive (VAR) model which, after accounting for pervasive co-movements of the variables by {\it common} factors, models the remaining {\it idiosyncratic} dynamic dependence between the variables as a sparse VAR process. Network estimation of FNETS consists of three steps: (i) factor-adjustment via dynamic principal component analysis, (ii) estimation of the latent VAR process via $\ell_1$-regularised Yule-Walker estimator, and (iii) estimation of partial correlation and long-run partial correlation matrices. In doing so, we learn three networks underpinning the VAR process, namely a directed network representing the Granger causal linkages between the variables, an undirected one embedding their contemporaneous relationships and finally, an undirected network that summarises both lead-lag and contemporaneous linkages. In addition, FNETS provides a suite of methods for forecasting the factor-driven and the idiosyncratic VAR processes. Under general conditions permitting tails heavier than the Gaussian one, we derive uniform consistency rates for the estimators in both network estimation and forecasting, which hold as the dimension of the panel and the sample size diverge. Simulation studies and real data application confirm the good performance of FNETS.</p></details> |  |
| **[ZAPBench: A Benchmark for Whole-Brain Activity Prediction in Zebrafish](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02618v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven benchmarks have led to significant progress in key scientific modeling domains including weather and structural biology. Here, we introduce the Zebrafish Activity Prediction Benchmark (ZAPBench) to measure progress on the problem of predicting cellular-resolution neural activity throughout an entire vertebrate brain. The benchmark is based on a novel dataset containing 4d light-sheet microscopy recordings of over 70,000 neurons in a larval zebrafish brain, along with motion stabilized and voxel-level cell segmentations of these data that facilitate development of a variety of forecasting methods. Initial results from a selection of time series and volumetric video modeling approaches achieve better performance than naive baseline methods, but also show room for further improvement. The specific brain used in the activity recording is also undergoing synaptic-level anatomical mapping, which will enable future integration of detailed structural information into forecasting methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lightweight Channel-wise Dynamic Fusion Model: Non-stationary Time Series Forecasting via Entropy Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02609v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-stationarity is an intrinsic property of real-world time series and plays a crucial role in time series forecasting. Previous studies primarily adopt instance normalization to attenuate the non-stationarity of original series for better predictability. However, instance normalization that directly removes the inherent non-stationarity can lead to three issues: (1) disrupting global temporal dependencies, (2) ignoring channel-specific differences, and (3) producing over-smoothed predictions. To address these issues, we theoretically demonstrate that variance can be a valid and interpretable proxy for quantifying non-stationarity of time series. Based on the analysis, we propose a novel lightweight \textit{C}hannel-wise \textit{D}ynamic \textit{F}usion \textit{M}odel (\textit{CDFM}), which selectively and dynamically recovers intrinsic non-stationarity of the original series, while keeping the predictability of normalized series. First, we design a Dual-Predictor Module, which involves two branches: a Time Stationary Predictor for capturing stable patterns and a Time Non-stationary Predictor for modeling global dynamics patterns. Second, we propose a Fusion Weight Learner to dynamically characterize the intrinsic non-stationary information across different samples based on variance. Finally, we introduce a Channel Selector to selectively recover non-stationary information from specific channels by evaluating their non-stationarity, similarity, and distribution consistency, enabling the model to capture relevant dynamic features and avoid overfitting. Comprehensive experiments on seven time series datasets demonstrate the superiority and generalization capabilities of CDFM.</p></details> |  |
| **[BRIDGE: Bootstrapping Text to Control Time-Series Generation via Multi-Agent Iterative Optimization and Diffusion Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02445v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series Generation (TSG) is a prominent research area with broad applications in simulations, data augmentation, and counterfactual analysis. While existing methods have shown promise in unconditional single-domain TSG, real-world applications demand for cross-domain approaches capable of controlled generation tailored to domain-specific constraints and instance-level requirements. In this paper, we argue that text can provide semantic insights, domain information and instance-specific temporal patterns, to guide and improve TSG. We introduce ``Text-Controlled TSG'', a task focused on generating realistic time series by incorporating textual descriptions. To address data scarcity in this setting, we propose a novel LLM-based Multi-Agent framework that synthesizes diverse, realistic text-to-TS datasets. Furthermore, we introduce BRIDGE, a hybrid text-controlled TSG framework that integrates semantic prototypes with text description for supporting domain-level guidance. This approach achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity on 11 of 12 datasets, and improves controllability by 12.52% on MSE and 6.34% MAE compared to no text input generation, highlighting its potential for generating tailored time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Utilizing Sequential Information of General Lab-test Results and Diagnoses History for Differential Diagnosis of Dementia](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15317v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) faces multiple data-related challenges, including high variability in patient data, limited access to specialized diagnostic tests, and overreliance on single-type indicators. These challenges are exacerbated by the progressive nature of AD, where subtle pathophysiological changes often precede clinical symptoms by decades. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel approach that takes advantage of routinely collected general laboratory test histories for the early detection and differential diagnosis of AD. By modeling lab test sequences as "sentences", we apply word embedding techniques to capture latent relationships between tests and employ deep time series models, including long-short-term memory (LSTM) and Transformer networks, to model temporal patterns in patient records. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves diagnostic accuracy and enables scalable and costeffective AD screening in diverse clinical settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Aggregation Strategies for Efficient Annotation of Bioacoustic Sound Events Using Active Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02422v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vast amounts of audio data collected in Sound Event Detection (SED) applications require efficient annotation strategies to enable supervised learning. Manual labeling is expensive and time-consuming, making Active Learning (AL) a promising approach for reducing annotation effort. We introduce Top K Entropy, a novel uncertainty aggregation strategy for AL that prioritizes the most uncertain segments within an audio recording, instead of averaging uncertainty across all segments. This approach enables the selection of entire recordings for annotation, improving efficiency in sparse data scenarios. We compare Top K Entropy to random sampling and Mean Entropy, and show that fewer labels can lead to the same model performance, particularly in datasets with sparse sound events. Evaluations are conducted on audio mixtures of sound recordings from parks with meerkat, dog, and baby crying sound events, representing real-world bioacoustic monitoring scenarios. Using Top K Entropy for active learning, we can achieve comparable performance to training on the fully labeled dataset with only 8% of the labels. Top K Entropy outperforms Mean Entropy, suggesting that it is best to let the most uncertain segments represent the uncertainty of an audio file. The findings highlight the potential of AL for scalable annotation in audio and time-series applications, including bioacoustics.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing approaches based on random convolution kernels, it dynamically selects the best couple of input representations and pooling operator during the training process. SelF-Rocket achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the University of California Riverside (UCR) TSC benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>v1: i...</summary><p>v1: initial version, incorrect evaluation. v2: Method improved, evaluation corrected, title simplified</p></details> |
| **[Nonparametric Sequential Change-point Detection on High Order Compositional Time Series Models with Exogenous Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02349v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential change-point detection for time series is widely used in data monitoring in practice. In this work, we focus on sequential change-point detection on high-order compositional time series models. Under the regularity conditions, we prove that a process following the generalized Beta AR(p) model with exogenous variables is stationary and ergodic. We develop a nonparametric sequential change-point detection method for the generalized Beta AR(p) model, which does not rely on any strong assumptions about the sources of the change points. We show that the power of the test converges to one given that the amount of initial observations is large enough. We apply the nonparametric method to a rate of automobile crashes with alcohol involved, which is recorded monthly from January 2010 to December 2020; the exogenous variable is the price level of alcoholic beverages, which has a change point around August 2019. We fit a generalized Beta AR(p) model to the crash rate sequence, and we use the nonparametric sequential change-point detection method to successfully detect the change point.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation Learning for Time-Domain High-Energy Astrophysics: Discovery of Extragalactic Fast X-ray Transient XRT 200515](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01150v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel representation learning method for downstream tasks like anomaly detection, unsupervised classification, and similarity searches in high-energy data sets. This enabled the discovery of a new extragalactic fast X-ray transient (FXT) in Chandra archival data, XRT 200515, a needle-in-the-haystack event and the first Chandra FXT of its kind. Recent serendipitous discoveries in X-ray astronomy, including FXTs from binary neutron star mergers and an extragalactic planetary transit candidate, highlight the need for systematic transient searches in X-ray archives. We introduce new event file representations, E-t maps and E-t-dt cubes, that effectively encode both temporal and spectral information, enabling the seamless application of machine learning to variable-length event file time series. Our unsupervised learning approach employs PCA or sparse autoencoders to extract low-dimensional, informative features from these data representations, followed by clustering in the embedding space with DBSCAN. New transients are identified within transient-dominant clusters or through nearest-neighbour searches around known transients, producing a catalogue of 3559 candidates (3447 flares and 112 dips). XRT 200515 exhibits unique temporal and spectral variability, including an intense, hard <10s initial burst, followed by spectral softening in an ~800s oscillating tail. We interpret XRT 200515 as either the first giant magnetar flare observed at low X-ray energies or the first extragalactic Type I X-ray burst from a faint, previously unknown low-mass X-ray binary in the LMC. Our method extends to data sets from other observatories such as XMM-Newton, Swift-XRT, eROSITA, Einstein Probe, and upcoming missions like AXIS.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, accepted in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</p></details> |

PanelMatch is an R package that implements a set of tools enabling researchers to apply matching methods for causal inference with time-series cross-sectional data. Relative to other commonly used methods for longitudinal analyses, like regression with fixed effects, the matching-based approach implemented in PanelMatch makes fewer parametric assumptions and offers more diagnostics. In this paper, we discuss the PanelMatch package, showing users a recommended pipeline for doing causal inference analysis with it and highlighting useful diagnostic and visualization tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Density estimation with LLMs: a geometric investigation of in-context learning trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05218v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable emergent abilities to perform in-context learning across various tasks, including time series forecasting. This work investigates LLMs' ability to estimate probability density functions (PDFs) from data observed in-context; such density estimation (DE) is a fundamental task underlying many probabilistic modeling problems. We leverage the Intensive Principal Component Analysis (InPCA) to visualize and analyze the in-context learning dynamics of LLaMA-2 models. Our main finding is that these LLMs all follow similar learning trajectories in a low-dimensional InPCA space, which are distinct from those of traditional density estimation methods like histograms and Gaussian kernel density estimation (KDE). We interpret the LLaMA in-context DE process as a KDE with an adaptive kernel width and shape. This custom kernel model captures a significant portion of LLaMA's behavior despite having only two parameters. We further speculate on why LLaMA's kernel width and shape differs from classical algorithms, providing insights into the mechanism of in-context probabilistic reasoning in LLMs. Our codebase, along with a 3D visualization of an LLM's in-context learning trajectory, is publicly available at https://github.com/AntonioLiu97/LLMICL_inPCA</p></details> |  |
| **[SensorQA: A Question Answering Benchmark for Daily-Life Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04974v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth in sensor data, effectively interpreting and interfacing with these data in a human-understandable way has become crucial. While existing research primarily focuses on learning classification models, fewer studies have explored how end users can actively extract useful insights from sensor data, often hindered by the lack of a proper dataset. To address this gap, we introduce SensorQA, the first human-created question-answering (QA) dataset for long-term time-series sensor data for daily life monitoring. SensorQA is created by human workers and includes 5.6K diverse and practical queries that reflect genuine human interests, paired with accurate answers derived from sensor data. We further establish benchmarks for state-of-the-art AI models on this dataset and evaluate their performance on typical edge devices. Our results reveal a gap between current models and optimal QA performance and efficiency, highlighting the need for new contributions. The dataset and code are available at: https://github.com/benjamin-reichman/SensorQA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-attention-based Diffusion Model for Time-series Imputation in Partial Blackout Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01737v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values in multivariate time series data can harm machine learning performance and introduce bias. These gaps arise from sensor malfunctions, blackouts, and human error and are typically addressed by data imputation. Previous work has tackled the imputation of missing data in random, complete blackouts and forecasting scenarios. The current paper addresses a more general missing pattern, which we call "partial blackout," where a subset of features is missing for consecutive time steps. We introduce a two-stage imputation process using self-attention and diffusion processes to model feature and temporal correlations. Notably, our model effectively handles missing data during training, enhancing adaptability and ensuring reliable imputation and performance, even with incomplete datasets. Our experiments on benchmark and two real-world time series datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art in partial blackout scenarios and shows better scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, Accepted in AAAI 2025 Main Track</p></details> |
| **[An Efficient Continual Learning Framework for Multivariate Time Series Prediction Tasks with Application to Vehicle State Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01669v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In continual time series analysis using neural networks, catastrophic forgetting (CF) of previously learned models when training on new data domains has always been a significant challenge. This problem is especially challenging in vehicle estimation and control, where new information is sequentially introduced to the model. Unfortunately, existing work on continual learning has not sufficiently addressed the adverse effects of catastrophic forgetting in time series analysis, particularly in multivariate output environments. In this paper, we present EM-ReSeleCT (Efficient Multivariate Representative Selection for Continual Learning in Time Series Tasks), an enhanced approach designed to handle continual learning in multivariate environments. Our approach strategically selects representative subsets from old and historical data and incorporates memory-based continual learning techniques with an improved optimization algorithm to adapt the pre-trained model on new information while preserving previously acquired information. Additionally, we develop a sequence-to-sequence transformer model (autoregressive model) specifically designed for vehicle state estimation. Moreover, we propose an uncertainty quantification framework using conformal prediction to assess the sensitivity of the memory size and to showcase the robustness of the proposed method. Experimental results from tests on an electric Equinox vehicle highlight the superiority of our method in continually learning new information while retaining prior knowledge, outperforming state-of-the-art continual learning methods. Furthermore, EM-ReSeleCT significantly reduces training time, a critical advantage in continual learning applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a General Time Series Anomaly Detector with Adaptive Bottlenecks and Dual Adversarial Decoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15273v4)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection plays a vital role in a wide range of applications. Existing methods require training one specific model for each dataset, which exhibits limited generalization capability across different target datasets, hindering anomaly detection performance in various scenarios with scarce training data. Aiming at this problem, we propose constructing a general time series anomaly detection model, which is pre-trained on extensive multi-domain datasets and can subsequently apply to a multitude of downstream scenarios. The significant divergence of time series data across different domains presents two primary challenges in building such a general model: (1) meeting the diverse requirements of appropriate information bottlenecks tailored to different datasets in one unified model, and (2) enabling distinguishment between multiple normal and abnormal patterns, both are crucial for effective anomaly detection in various target scenarios. To tackle these two challenges, we propose a General time series anomaly Detector with Adaptive Bottlenecks and Dual Adversarial Decoders (DADA), which enables flexible selection of bottlenecks based on different data and explicitly enhances clear differentiation between normal and abnormal series. We conduct extensive experiments on nine target datasets from different domains. After pre-training on multi-domain data, DADA, serving as a zero-shot anomaly detector for these datasets, still achieves competitive or even superior results compared to those models tailored to each specific dataset. The code is made available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/DADA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[FLEXtime: Filterbank learning to explain time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05841v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art methods for explaining predictions from time series involve learning an instance-wise saliency mask for each time step; however, many types of time series are difficult to interpret in the time domain, due to the inherently complex nature of the data. Instead, we propose to view time series explainability as saliency maps over interpretable parts, leaning on established signal processing methodology on signal decomposition. Specifically, we propose a new method called FLEXtime that uses a bank of bandpass filters to split the time series into frequency bands. Then, we learn the combination of these bands that optimally explains the model's prediction. Our extensive evaluation shows that, on average, FLEXtime outperforms state-of-the-art explainability methods across a range of datasets. FLEXtime fills an important gap in the current time series explainability methodology and is a valuable tool for a wide range of time series such as EEG and audio. Code will be made available at https://github.com/theabrusch/FLEXtime.</p></details> |  |

Vision compression can alleviate this problem by reducing the vision token count. Previous approaches compress vision tokens with external modules and force LLMs to understand the compressed ones, leading to visual information loss. However, the LLMs' understanding paradigm of vision tokens is not fully utilised in the compression learning process. We propose VoCo-LLaMA, the first approach to compress vision tokens using LLMs. By introducing Vision Compression tokens during the vision instruction tuning phase and leveraging attention distillation, our method distill how LLMs comprehend vision tokens into their processing of VoCo tokens. VoCo-LLaMA facilitates effective vision compression and improves the computational efficiency during the inference stage. Specifically, our method achieves minimal performance loss with a compression ratio of 576$\times$, resulting in up to 94.8$\%$ fewer FLOPs and 69.6$\%$ acceleration in inference time. Furthermore, through continuous training using time-series compressed token sequences of video frames, VoCo-LLaMA demonstrates the ability to understand temporal correlations, outperforming previous methods on popular video question-answering benchmarks. Our approach presents a promising way to unlock the full potential of VLMs' contextual window, enabling more scalable multi-modal applications.

| **[ReFocus: Reinforcing Mid-Frequency and Key-Frequency Modeling for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16890v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements have progressively incorporated frequency-based techniques into deep learning models, leading to notable improvements in accuracy and efficiency for time series analysis tasks. However, the Mid-Frequency Spectrum Gap in the real-world time series, where the energy is concentrated at the low-frequency region while the middle-frequency band is negligible, hinders the ability of existing deep learning models to extract the crucial frequency information. Additionally, the shared Key-Frequency in multivariate time series, where different time series share indistinguishable frequency patterns, is rarely exploited by existing literature. This work introduces a novel module, Adaptive Mid-Frequency Energy Optimizer, based on convolution and residual learning, to emphasize the significance of mid-frequency bands. We also propose an Energy-based Key-Frequency Picking Block to capture shared Key-Frequency, which achieves superior inter-series modeling performance with fewer parameters. A novel Key-Frequency Enhanced Training strategy is employed to further enhance Key-Frequency modeling, where spectral information from other channels is randomly introduced into each channel. Our approach advanced multivariate time series forecasting on the challenging Traffic, ECL, and Solar benchmarks, reducing MSE by 4%, 6%, and 5% compared to the previous SOTA iTransformer.

| **[Scintillation pulse characterization with spectrum-inspired temporal neural networks: case studies on particle detector signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07267v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Particle detectors based on scintillators are widely used in high-energy physics and astroparticle physics experiments, nuclear medicine imaging, industrial and environmental detection, etc. Precisely extracting scintillation signal characteristics at the event level is important for these applications, not only in respect of understanding the scintillator itself, but also kinds and physical property of incident particles. Recent researches demonstrate data-driven neural networks surpass traditional statistical methods, especially when the analytical form of signals is hard to obtain, or noise is significant. However, most densely connected or convolution-based networks fail to fully exploit the spectral and temporal structure of scintillation signals, leaving large space for performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a network architecture specially tailored for scintillation pulse characterization based on previous works on time series analysis. The core insight is that, by directly applying Fast Fourier Transform on original signals and utilizing different frequency components, the proposed network architecture can serve as a lightweight and enhanced representation learning backbone. We prove our idea in two case studies: (a) simulation data generated with the setting of the LUX dark matter detector, and (b) experimental electrical signals with fast electronics to emulate scintillation variations for the NICA/MPD calorimeter. The proposed model achieves significantly better results than the reference model in literature and densely connected models, and demonstrates higher cost-efficiency than conventional machine learning methods.</p></details> | 29 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Decision-Focused Fine-Tuning of Time Series Foundation Models for Dispatchable Feeder Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01936v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models provide a universal solution for generating forecasts to support optimization problems in energy systems. Those foundation models are typically trained in a prediction-focused manner to maximize forecast quality. In contrast, decision-focused learning directly improves the resulting value of the forecast in downstream optimization rather than merely maximizing forecasting quality. The practical integration of forecast values into forecasting models is challenging, particularly when addressing complex applications with diverse instances, such as buildings. This becomes even more complicated when instances possess specific characteristics that require instance-specific, tailored predictions to increase the forecast value. To tackle this challenge, we use decision-focused fine-tuning within time series foundation models to offer a scalable and efficient solution for decision-focused learning applied to the dispatchable feeder optimization problem. To obtain more robust predictions for scarce building data, we use Moirai as a state-of-the-art foundation model, which offers robust and generalized results with few-shot parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Comparing the decision-focused fine-tuned Moirai with a state-of-the-art classical prediction-focused fine-tuning Morai, we observe an improvement of 9.45% in average total daily costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[OIPR: Evaluation for Time-series Anomaly Detection Inspired by Operator Interest](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01260v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing adoption of time-series anomaly detection (TAD) technology, numerous studies have employed deep learning-based detectors for analyzing time-series data in the fields of Internet services, industrial systems, and sensors. The selection and optimization of anomaly detectors strongly rely on the availability of an effective performance evaluation method for TAD. Since anomalies in time-series data often manifest as a sequence of points, conventional metrics that solely consider the detection of individual point are inadequate. Existing evaluation methods for TAD typically employ point-based or event-based metrics to capture the temporal context. However, point-based metrics tend to overestimate detectors that excel only in detecting long anomalies, while event-based metrics are susceptible to being misled by fragmented detection results. To address these limitations, we propose OIPR, a novel set of TAD evaluation metrics. It models the process of operators receiving detector alarms and handling faults, utilizing area under the operator interest curve to evaluate the performance of TAD algorithms. Furthermore, we build a special scenario dataset to compare the characteristics of different evaluation methods. Through experiments conducted on the special scenario dataset and five real-world datasets, we demonstrate the remarkable performance of OIPR in extreme and complex scenarios. It achieves a balance between point and event perspectives, overcoming their primary limitations and offering applicability to broader situations.</p></details> |  |

The ultimate goal is to develop an ability to predict the measurement on the wafer surface wear through monitoring the components health state. This translates to cost saving in large scale production. The PHM dataset contains many time series measurements not utilized by traditional physics based approach. On the other hand task, applying a data driven approach such as deep learning to the PHM dataset is non-trivial. The main issue with supervised deep learning is that class label is not available to the PHM dataset. Second, the feature space trained by an unsupervised deep learner is not specifically targeted at the predictive ability or regression. In this work, we propose using the autoencoder based clustering whereby the feature space trained is found to be more suitable for performing regression. This is due to having a more compact distribution of samples respective to their nearest cluster means. We justify our claims by comparing the performance of our proposed method on the PHM dataset with several baselines such as the autoencoder as well as state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

Existing time series foundation models often adopt methodologies from these fields without addressing the unique characteristics of time series data. In this paper, we identify two key challenges in cross-domain time series forecasting: the complexity of temporal patterns and semantic misalignment. To tackle these issues, we propose the ``Unify and Anchor" transfer paradigm, which disentangles frequency components for a unified perspective and incorporates external context as domain anchors for guided adaptation. Based on this framework, we introduce ContexTST, a Transformer-based model that employs a time series coordinator for structured representation and the Transformer blocks with a context-informed mixture-of-experts mechanism for effective cross-domain generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContexTST advances state-of-the-art forecasting performance while achieving strong zero-shot transferability across diverse domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables, conference under review</p></details> |

While this strategy avoids the need for tractable likelihoods, it often requires a large number of simulations and has been challenging to scale to time series data. Scientific simulators frequently emulate real-world dynamics through thousands of single-state transitions over time. We propose an SBI approach that can exploit such Markovian simulators by locally identifying parameters consistent with individual state transitions. We then compose these local results to obtain a posterior over parameters that align with the entire time series observation. We focus on applying this approach to neural posterior score estimation but also show how it can be applied, e.g., to neural likelihood (ratio) estimation. We demonstrate that our approach is more simulation-efficient than directly estimating the global posterior on several synthetic benchmark tasks and simulators used in ecology and epidemiology. Finally, we validate scalability and simulation efficiency of our approach by applying it to a high-dimensional Kolmogorov flow simulator with around one million data dimensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the proceedings of the Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025), Singapore, 2025</p></details> |

However, achieving accurate vehicular channel prediction is challenging due to significant Doppler effects and rapid channel variations resulting from high-speed vehicle movement and complex propagation environments. In this paper, we propose a novel delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel prediction framework tailored for high-mobility vehicular networks. By transforming the channel representation into the DD domain, we obtain an intuitive, sparse, and stable depiction that closely aligns with the underlying physical propagation processes, effectively reducing the complex vehicular channel to a set of time-series parameters with enhanced predictability. Furthermore, we leverage the large artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict these DD-domain time-series parameters, capitalizing on their advanced ability to model temporal correlations. The zero-shot capability of the pre-trained large AI model facilitates accurate channel predictions without requiring task-specific training, while subsequent fine-tuning on specific vehicular channel data further improves prediction accuracy. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our DD-domain channel prediction framework and the superior accuracy of the large AI model in predicting time-series channel parameters, thereby highlighting the potential of our approach for robust vehicular communication systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Multi-modal Time Series Prediction with LLM-in-the-Loop](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01013v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis provides essential insights for real-world system dynamics and informs downstream decision-making, yet most existing methods often overlook the rich contextual signals present in auxiliary modalities. To bridge this gap, we introduce TimeXL, a multi-modal prediction framework that integrates a prototype-based time series encoder with three collaborating Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver more accurate predictions and interpretable explanations. First, a multi-modal prototype-based encoder processes both time series and textual inputs to generate preliminary forecasts alongside case-based rationales. These outputs then feed into a prediction LLM, which refines the forecasts by reasoning over the encoder's predictions and explanations. Next, a reflection LLM compares the predicted values against the ground truth, identifying textual inconsistencies or noise. Guided by this feedback, a refinement LLM iteratively enhances text quality and triggers encoder retraining. This closed-loop workflow -- prediction, critique (reflect), and refinement -- continuously boosts the framework's performance and interpretability. Empirical evaluations on four real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeXL achieves up to 8.9\% improvement in AUC and produces human-centric, multi-modal explanations, highlighting the power of LLM-driven reasoning for time series prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamical Diffusion: Learning Temporal Dynamics with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00951v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative frameworks by progressively adding noise to data through a forward process and then reversing this process to generate realistic samples. While these models have achieved strong performance across various tasks and modalities, their application to temporal predictive learning remains underexplored. Existing approaches treat predictive learning as a conditional generation problem, but often fail to fully exploit the temporal dynamics inherent in the data, leading to challenges in generating temporally coherent sequences. To address this, we introduce Dynamical Diffusion (DyDiff), a theoretically sound framework that incorporates temporally aware forward and reverse processes. Dynamical Diffusion explicitly models temporal transitions at each diffusion step, establishing dependencies on preceding states to better capture temporal dynamics. Through the reparameterization trick, Dynamical Diffusion achieves efficient training and inference similar to any standard diffusion model. Extensive experiments across scientific spatiotemporal forecasting, video prediction, and time series forecasting demonstrate that Dynamical Diffusion consistently improves performance in temporal predictive tasks, filling a crucial gap in existing methodologies.

| **[S4M: S4 for multivariate time series forecasting with Missing values](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00900v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series data play a pivotal role in a wide range of real-world applications. However, the presence of block missing data introduces significant challenges, often compromising the performance of predictive models. Traditional two-step approaches, which first impute missing values and then perform forecasting, are prone to error accumulation, particularly in complex multivariate settings characterized by high missing ratios and intricate dependency structures. In this work, we introduce S4M, an end-to-end time series forecasting framework that seamlessly integrates missing data handling into the Structured State Space Sequence (S4) model architecture. Unlike conventional methods that treat imputation as a separate preprocessing step, S4M leverages the latent space of S4 models to directly recognize and represent missing data patterns, thereby more effectively capturing the underlying temporal and multivariate dependencies. Our framework comprises two key components: the Adaptive Temporal Prototype Mapper (ATPM) and the Missing-Aware Dual Stream S4 (MDS-S4). The ATPM employs a prototype bank to derive robust and informative representations from historical data patterns, while the MDS-S4 processes these representations alongside missingness masks as dual input streams to enable accurate forecasting. Through extensive empirical evaluations on diverse real-world datasets, we demonstrate that S4M consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. These results underscore the efficacy of our integrated approach in handling missing data, showcasing its robustness and superiority over traditional imputation-based methods. Our findings highlight the potential of S4M to advance reliable time series forecasting in practical applications, offering a promising direction for future research and deployment.

| **[Patch-wise Structural Loss for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00877v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting has gained significant attention in machine learning due to its crucial role in various domains. However, most existing forecasting models rely heavily on point-wise loss functions like Mean Square Error, which treat each time step independently and neglect the structural dependencies inherent in time series data, making it challenging to capture complex temporal patterns accurately. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Patch-wise Structural (PS) loss, designed to enhance structural alignment by comparing time series at the patch level. Through leveraging local statistical properties, such as correlation, variance, and mean, PS loss captures nuanced structural discrepancies overlooked by traditional point-wise losses. Furthermore, it integrates seamlessly with point-wise loss, simultaneously addressing local structural inconsistencies and individual time-step errors. PS loss establishes a novel benchmark for accurately modeling complex time series data and provides a new perspective on time series loss function design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PS loss significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

To uniformly predict multidimensional time series, we generalize next token prediction, predominantly adopted for 1D token sequences, to multivariate next token prediction. The paradigm formulates various forecasting tasks as a long-context prediction problem. We opt for decoder-only Transformers that capture causal dependencies from varying-length contexts for unified forecasting, making predictions on non-stationary univariate time series, multivariate series with complicated dynamics and correlations, as well as covariate-informed contexts that include exogenous variables. Technically, we propose a universal TimeAttention to capture fine-grained intra- and inter-series dependencies of flattened time series tokens (patches), which is further enhanced by deft position embedding for temporal causality and variable equivalence. Timer-XL achieves state-of-the-art performance across task-specific forecasting benchmarks through a unified approach. Based on large-scale pre-training, Timer-XL achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, making it a promising architecture for pre-trained time series models.

Moreover, the disparities of statistical characteristics between levels can be huge, worsened by non-Gaussian distributions and non-linear correlations. To this extent, we propose a novel end-to-end hierarchical time series forecasting model, based on conditioned normalizing flow-based autoregressive transformer reconciliation, to represent complex data distribution while simultaneously reconciling the forecasts to ensure coherency. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, we achieve the forecasting and reconciliation simultaneously without requiring any explicit post-processing step. In addition, by harnessing the power of deep model, we do not rely on any assumption such as unbiased estimates or Gaussian distribution. Our evaluation experiments are conducted on four real-world hierarchical datasets from different industrial domains (three public ones and a dataset from the application servers of Alipay's data center) and the preliminary results demonstrate efficacy of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 22nd IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM2022)</p></details> |

Inherently, dynamic network patterns can be complex due to dyadic and temporal dependence, and change points detection can identify the discrepancies in the underlying data generating processes to facilitate downstream analysis. Moreover, the STERGM that utilizes network statistics to represent the structural patterns is a flexible and parsimonious model to fit dynamic networks. We propose a new estimator derived from the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) procedure and Group Fused Lasso (GFL) regularization to simultaneously detect multiple time points, where the parameters of a time-heterogeneous STERGM have changed. We also provide a Bayesian information criterion for model selection and an R package CPDstergm to implement the proposed method. Experiments on simulated and real data show good performance of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods often fail to capture complex patterns from seasonal variability and special events. Despite advancements in deep learning, interpretable forecasting models remain a challenge. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Channel Data Fusion Network (MCDFN), a hybrid architecture that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to enhance predictive performance by extracting spatial and temporal features from time series data. Our comparative benchmarking demonstrates that MCDFN outperforms seven other deep-learning models, achieving superior metrics: MSE (23.5738), RMSE (4.8553), MAE (3.9991), and MAPE (20.1575%). Theil's U statistic of 0.1181 (U<1) of MCDFN indicates its superiority over the naive forecasting approach, and a 10-fold cross-validated statistical paired t-test with a p-value of 5% indicated no significant difference between MCDFN's predictions and actual values. We apply explainable AI techniques like ShapTime and Permutation Feature Importance to enhance interpretability. This research advances demand forecasting methodologies and offers practical guidelines for integrating MCDFN into supply chain systems, highlighting future research directions for scalability and user-friendly deployment.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present the time series pattern machine (TSPM), a model designed to excel in a broad range of time series tasks through powerful representation and pattern extraction capabilities. Traditional time series models often struggle to capture universal patterns, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. To address this, we define multiple scales in the time domain and various resolutions in the frequency domain, employing various mixing strategies to extract intricate, task-adaptive time series patterns. Specifically, we introduce a general-purpose TSPM that processes multi-scale time series using (1) multi-resolution time imaging (MRTI), (2) time image decomposition (TID), (3) multi-scale mixing (MCM), and (4) multi-resolution mixing (MRM) to extract comprehensive temporal patterns. MRTI transforms multi-scale time series into multi-resolution time images, capturing patterns across both temporal and frequency domains. TID leverages dual-axis attention to extract seasonal and trend patterns, while MCM hierarchically aggregates these patterns across scales. MRM adaptively integrates all representations across resolutions. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 time series analytical tasks, consistently surpassing both general-purpose and task-specific models. Our work marks a promising step toward the next generation of TSPMs, paving the way for further advancements in time series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

Echo state network (ESN) is a class of recurrent neural networks that can be used to identify unique patterns in time-series data and predict future events. It is known for minimal computing resource requirements and fast training, owing to the use of linear optimization solely at the readout stage. In this work, a custom-design neuromorphic chip based on ESN targeting edge devices is proposed. The proposed system supports various learning mechanisms, including structural plasticity and synaptic plasticity, locally on-chip. This provides the network with an additional degree of freedom to continuously learn, adapt, and alter its structure and sparsity level, ensuring high performance and continuous stability. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed system as well as its robustness to noise against real-world time-series datasets while considering various topologies of data movement. An average accuracy of 95.95% and 85.24% are achieved on human activity recognition and prosthetic finger control, respectively. We also illustrate that the proposed system offers a throughput of 6x10^4 samples/sec with a power consumption of 47.7mW on a 65nm IBM process.</p></details> |  |

Although resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is a promising non-invasive measurement of brain biomarkers to predict drug response in therapeutic development, the complexity of fMRI demands machine learning models with substantial capacity. However, extreme data scarcity in neuropathic pain research limits the application of high-capacity models. To address the challenge of data scarcity, we propose FMM$_{TC}$, a Foundation-Model-boosted Multimodal learning framework for fMRI-based neuropathic pain drug response prediction, which leverages both internal multimodal information in pain-specific data and external knowledge from large pain-agnostic data. Specifically, to maximize the value of limited pain-specific data, FMM$_{TC}$ integrates complementary information from two rs-fMRI modalities: Time series and functional Connectivity. FMM$_{TC}$ is further boosted by an fMRI foundation model with its external knowledge from extensive pain-agnostic fMRI datasets enriching limited pain-specific information. Evaluations with an in-house dataset and a public dataset from OpenNeuro demonstrate FMM$_{TC}$'s superior representation ability, generalizability, and cross-dataset adaptability over existing unimodal fMRI models that only consider one of the rs-fMRI modalities. The ablation study validates the effectiveness of multimodal learning and foundation-model-powered external knowledge transfer in FMM$_{TC}$. An integrated gradient-based interpretation study explains how FMM$_{TC}$'s cross-dataset dynamic behaviors enhance its adaptability. In conclusion, FMM$_{TC}$ boosts clinical trials in neuropathic pain therapeutic development by accurately predicting drug responses to improve the participant stratification efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Curse of Attention: A Kernel-Based Perspective for Why Transformers Fail to Generalize on Time Series Forecasting and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06061v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of transformer-based models on time series forecasting (TSF) tasks has long been popular to study. However, many of these works fail to beat the simple linear residual model, and the theoretical understanding of this issue is still limited. In this work, we propose the first theoretical explanation of the inefficiency of transformers on TSF tasks. We attribute the mechanism behind it to {\bf Asymmetric Learning} in training attention networks. When the sign of the previous step is inconsistent with the sign of the current step in the next-step-prediction time series, attention fails to learn the residual features. This makes it difficult to generalize on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, especially on the sign-inconsistent next-step-prediction data, with the same representation pattern, whereas a linear residual network could easily accomplish it. We hope our theoretical insights provide important necessary conditions for designing the expressive and efficient transformer-based architecture for practitioners.</p></details> | CPAL 2025 |

Beyond forecasting, considerable real-world tasks are categorized into classification, imputation, and anomaly detection, underscoring different capabilities termed time series understanding in this paper. While GPT-style models have been positioned as foundation models for time series forecasting, the BERT-style architecture, which has made significant advances in natural language understanding, has not been fully unlocked for time series understanding, possibly attributed to the undesirable dropout of essential elements of BERT. In this paper, inspired by the shared multi-granularity structure between multivariate time series and multisentence documents, we design TimesBERT to learn generic representations of time series including temporal patterns and variate-centric characteristics. In addition to a natural adaptation of masked modeling, we propose a parallel task of functional token prediction to embody vital multi-granularity structures. Our model is pre-trained on 260 billion time points across diverse domains. Leveraging multi-granularity representations, TimesBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance across four typical downstream understanding tasks, outperforming task-specific models and language pre-trained backbones, positioning it as a versatile foundation model for time series understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Kolmogorov Barrier: A Learnable Weighted Hybrid Autoencoder for Model Order Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18148v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</p></details> | 31 pages |

A predominant source of this instability stems from gradient and loss spikes, which disrupt the learning process, often leading to costly interventions like checkpoint recovery and experiment restarts, further amplifying inefficiencies. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into gradient spikes observed during LLM training, revealing their prevalence across multiple architectures and datasets. Our analysis shows that these spikes can be up to $1000\times$ larger than typical gradients, substantially deteriorating model performance. To address this issue, we propose Spike-Aware Adam with Momentum Reset SPAM, a novel optimizer designed to counteract gradient spikes through momentum reset and spike-aware gradient clipping. Extensive experiments, including both pre-training and fine-tuning, demonstrate that SPAM consistently surpasses Adam and its variants across various tasks, including (1) LLM pre-training from 60M to 1B, (2) 4-bit LLM pre-training,(3) reinforcement learning, and (4) Time Series Forecasting. Additionally, SPAM facilitates memory-efficient training by enabling sparse momentum, where only a subset of momentum terms are maintained and updated. When operating under memory constraints, SPAM outperforms state-of-the-art memory-efficient optimizers such as GaLore and Adam-Mini. Our work underscores the importance of mitigating gradient spikes in LLM training and introduces an effective optimization strategy that enhances both training stability and resource efficiency at scale.

Specifically, we revisit ideas from amortized inference and neural operators, and propose a novel supervised learning framework for zero-shot time series imputation, through parametric functions satisfying some (hidden) ODEs. Our proposal consists of two components. First, a broad probability distribution over the space of ODE solutions, observation times and noise mechanisms, with which we generate a large, synthetic dataset of (hidden) ODE solutions, along with their noisy and sparse observations. Second, a neural recognition model that is trained offline, to map the generated time series onto the spaces of initial conditions and time derivatives of the (hidden) ODE solutions, which we then integrate to impute the missing data. We empirically demonstrate that one and the same (pretrained) recognition model can perform zero-shot imputation across 63 distinct time series with missing values, each sampled from widely different dynamical systems. Likewise, we demonstrate that it can perform zero-shot imputation of missing high-dimensional data in 10 vastly different settings, spanning human motion, air quality, traffic and electricity studies, as well as Navier-Stokes simulations -- without requiring any fine-tuning. What is more, our proposal often outperforms state-of-the-art methods, which are trained on the target datasets. Our pretrained model, repository and tutorials are available online.</p></details> |  |

While these models are effective for a variety of tasks, their applicability in medical domains with limited data remains largely unexplored. To address this, we investigate the effectiveness of foundation models in medical time series analysis involving electroencephalography (EEG). Through extensive experiments on tasks such as age prediction, seizure detection, and the classification of clinically relevant EEG events, we compare their diagnostic accuracy with that of specialised EEG models. Our analysis shows that foundation models extract meaningful EEG features, outperform specialised models even without domain adaptation, and localise task-specific biomarkers. Moreover, we demonstrate that diagnostic accuracy is substantially influenced by architectural choices such as context length. Overall, our study reveals that foundation models with general time series understanding eliminate the dependency on large domain-specific datasets, making them valuable tools for clinical practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detection of anomalies in cow activity using wavelet transform based features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21051v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Precision Livestock Farming, detecting deviations from optimal or baseline values - i.e. anomalies in time series - is essential to allow undertaking corrective actions rapidly. Here we aim at detecting anomalies in 24h time series of cow activity, with a view to detect cases of disease or oestrus. Deviations must be distinguished from noise which can be very high in case of biological data. It is also important to detect the anomaly early, e.g. before a farmer would notice it visually. Here, we investigate the benefit of using wavelet transforms to denoise data and we assess the performance of an anomaly detection algorithm considering the timing of the detection. We developed features based on the comparisons between the wavelet transforms of the mean of the time series and the wavelet transforms of individual time series instances. We hypothesized that these features contribute to the detection of anomalies in periodic time series using a feature-based algorithm. We tested this hypothesis with two datasets representing cow activity, which typically follows a daily pattern but can deviate due to specific physiological or pathological conditions. We applied features derived from wavelet transform as well as statistical features in an Isolation Forest algorithm. We measured the distance of detection between the days annotated abnormal by animal caretakers days and the days predicted abnormal by the algorithm. The results show that wavelet-based features are among the features most contributing to anomaly detection. They also show that detections are close to the annotated days, and often precede it. In conclusion, using wavelet transforms on time series of cow activity data helps to detect anomalies related to specific cow states. The detection is often obtained on days that precede the day annotated by caretakers, which offer possibility to take corrective actions at an early stage.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables, 1 algorithm</p></details> |
| **[Forecasting Monthly Residential Natural Gas Demand Using Just-In-Time-Learning Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20989v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural gas (NG) is relatively a clean source of energy, particularly compared to fossil fuels, and worldwide consumption of NG has been increasing almost linearly in the last two decades. A similar trend can also be seen in Turkey, while another similarity is the high dependence on imports for the continuous NG supply. It is crucial to accurately forecast future NG demand (NGD) in Turkey, especially, for import contracts; in this respect, forecasts of monthly NGD for the following year are of utmost importance. In the current study, the historical monthly NG consumption data between 2014 and 2024 provided by SOCAR, the local residential NG distribution company for two cities in Turkey, Bursa and Kayseri, was used to determine out-of-sample monthly NGD forecasts for a period of one year and nine months using various time series models, including SARIMA and ETS models, and a novel proposed machine learning method. The proposed method, named Just-in-Time-Learning-Gaussian Process Regression (JITL-GPR), uses a novel feature representation for the past NG demand values; instead of using past demand values as column-wise separate features, they are placed on a two-dimensional (2-D) grid of year-month values. For each test point, a kernel function, tailored for the NGD predictions, is used in GPR to predict the query point. Since a model is constructed separately for each test point, the proposed method is, indeed, an example of JITL. The JITL-GPR method is easy to use and optimize, and offers a reduction in forecast errors compared to traditional time series methods and a state-of-the-art combination model; therefore, it is a promising tool for NGD forecasting in similar settings.</p></details> |  |

Its origins are multifaceted, resulting in various missing mechanisms. Prior research in this field has predominantly revolved around the assumption of the Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) mechanism. However, Missing At Random (MAR) and Missing Not At Random (MNAR) mechanisms, though equally prevalent, have often remained underexplored despite their significant influence. This PhD project presents a comprehensive research agenda designed to investigate the implications of diverse missing data mechanisms. The principal aim is to devise robust methodologies capable of effectively handling missing data while accommodating the unique characteristics of MCAR, MAR, and MNAR mechanisms. By addressing these gaps, this research contributes to an enriched understanding of the challenges posed by missing data across various industries and data modalities. It seeks to provide practical solutions that enable the effective management of missing data, empowering researchers and practitioners to leverage incomplete datasets confidently.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was presented at the ECML PKDD 2024 PhD Forum. https://ecmlpkdd. org/2024/program-accepted-phd-forum/</p></details> |
| **[Concealed Adversarial attacks on neural networks for sequential data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20948v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of deep learning led to the broad usage of neural networks in the time series domain for various applications, including finance and medicine. While powerful, these models are prone to adversarial attacks: a benign targeted perturbation of input data leads to significant changes in a classifier's output. However, formally small attacks in the time series domain become easily detected by the human eye or a simple detector model. We develop a concealed adversarial attack for different time-series models: it provides more realistic perturbations, being hard to detect by a human or model discriminator. To achieve this goal, the proposed adversarial attack maximizes an aggregation of a classifier and a trained discriminator loss. To make the attack stronger, we also propose a training procedure for a discriminator that provides broader coverage of possible attacks. Extensive benchmarking on six UCR time series datasets across four diverse architectures - including recurrent, convolutional, state-space, and transformer-based models - demonstrates the superiority of our attack for a concealability-efficiency trade-off. Our findings highlight the growing challenge of designing robust time series models, emphasizing the need for improved defenses against realistic and effective attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Statistical inference for large-dimensional tensor factor model by iterative projections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09800v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor Factor Models (TFM) are appealing dimension reduction tools for high-order large-dimensional tensor time series, and have wide applications in economics, finance and medical imaging. In this paper, we propose a projection estimator for the Tucker-decomposition based TFM, and provide its least-square interpretation which parallels to the least-square interpretation of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for the vector factor model. The projection technique simultaneously reduces the dimensionality of the signal component and the magnitudes of the idiosyncratic component tensor, thus leading to an increase of the signal-to-noise ratio. We derive a convergence rate of the projection estimator of the loadings and the common factor tensor which are faster than that of the naive PCA-based estimator. Our results are obtained under mild conditions which allow the idiosyncratic components to be weakly cross- and auto- correlated. We also provide a novel iterative procedure based on the eigenvalue-ratio principle to determine the factor numbers. Extensive numerical studies are conducted to investigate the empirical performance of the proposed projection estimators relative to the state-of-the-art ones.</p></details> |  |
| **[FACTS: A Factored State-Space Framework For World Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20922v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World modelling is essential for understanding and predicting the dynamics of complex systems by learning both spatial and temporal dependencies. However, current frameworks, such as Transformers and selective state-space models like Mambas, exhibit limitations in efficiently encoding spatial and temporal structures, particularly in scenarios requiring long-term high-dimensional sequence modelling. To address these issues, we propose a novel recurrent framework, the \textbf{FACT}ored \textbf{S}tate-space (\textbf{FACTS}) model, for spatial-temporal world modelling. The FACTS framework constructs a graph-structured memory with a routing mechanism that learns permutable memory representations, ensuring invariance to input permutations while adapting through selective state-space propagation. Furthermore, FACTS supports parallel computation of high-dimensional sequences. We empirically evaluate FACTS across diverse tasks, including multivariate time series forecasting, object-centric world modelling, and spatial-temporal graph prediction, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms or matches specialised state-of-the-art models, despite its general-purpose world modelling design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code released in https://github.com/NanboLi/FACTS</p></details> |
| **[Stochastic Optimal Control for Diffusion Bridges in Function Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20630v5)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion models and diffusion bridges primarily focus on finite-dimensional spaces, yet many real-world problems necessitate operations in infinite-dimensional function spaces for more natural and interpretable formulations. In this paper, we present a theory of stochastic optimal control (SOC) tailored to infinite-dimensional spaces, aiming to extend diffusion-based algorithms to function spaces. Specifically, we demonstrate how Doob's $h$-transform, the fundamental tool for constructing diffusion bridges, can be derived from the SOC perspective and expanded to infinite dimensions. This expansion presents a challenge, as infinite-dimensional spaces typically lack closed-form densities. Leveraging our theory, we establish that solving the optimal control problem with a specific objective function choice is equivalent to learning diffusion-based generative models. We propose two applications: (1) learning bridges between two infinite-dimensional distributions and (2) generative models for sampling from an infinite-dimensional distribution. Our approach proves effective for diverse problems involving continuous function space representations, such as resolution-free images, time-series data, and probability density functions.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-Dimensional Knockoffs Inference for Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09851v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We make some initial attempt to establish the theoretical and methodological foundation for the model-X knockoffs inference for time series data. We suggest the method of time series knockoffs inference (TSKI) by exploiting the ideas of subsampling and e-values to address the difficulty caused by the serial dependence. We also generalize the robust knockoffs inference in Barber, Cand\`es, and Samworth to the time series setting to relax the assumption of known covariate distribution required by model-X knockoffs, since such an assumption is overly stringent for time series data. We establish sufficient conditions under which TSKI achieves the asymptotic false discovery rate (FDR) control. Our technical analysis reveals the effects of serial dependence and unknown covariate distribution on the FDR control. We conduct a power analysis of TSKI using the Lasso coefficient difference knockoff statistic under the generalized linear time series models. The finite-sample performance of TSKI is illustrated with several simulation examples and an economic inflation study.</p></details> | 106 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Temporal Wasserstein Imputation: Versatile Missing Data Imputation for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02811v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing data can significantly hamper standard time series analysis, yet in practice they are frequently encountered. In this paper, we introduce temporal Wasserstein imputation, a novel method for imputing missing data in time series. Unlike existing techniques, our approach is fully nonparametric, circumventing the need for model specification prior to imputation, making it suitable for potential nonlinear dynamics. Its principled algorithmic implementation can seamlessly handle univariate or multivariate time series with any non-systematic missing pattern. In addition, the plausible range and side information of the missing entries (such as box constraints) can easily be incorporated. As a key advantage, our method mitigates the distributional bias typical of many existing approaches, ensuring more reliable downstream statistical analysis using the imputed series. Leveraging the benign landscape of the optimization formulation, we establish the convergence of an alternating minimization algorithm to critical points. We also provide conditions under which the marginal distributions of the underlying time series can be identified. Numerical experiments, including extensive simulations covering linear and nonlinear time series models and a real-world groundwater dataset laden with missing values, corroborate the practical usefulness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Amortized Control of Continuous State Space Feynman-Kac Model for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05602v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world datasets, such as healthcare, climate, and economics, are often collected as irregular time series, which poses challenges for accurate modeling. In this paper, we propose the Amortized Control of continuous State Space Model (ACSSM) for continuous dynamical modeling of time series for irregular and discrete observations. We first present a multi-marginal Doob's $h$-transform to construct a continuous dynamical system conditioned on these irregular observations. Following this, we introduce a variational inference algorithm with a tight evidence lower bound (ELBO), leveraging stochastic optimal control (SOC) theory to approximate the intractable Doob's $h$-transform and simulate the conditioned dynamics. To improve efficiency and scalability during both training and inference, ACSSM leverages auxiliary variable to flexibly parameterize the latent dynamics and amortized control. Additionally, it incorporates a simulation-free latent dynamics framework and a transformer-based data assimilation scheme, facilitating parallel inference of the latent states and ELBO computation. Through empirical evaluations across a variety of real-world datasets, ACSSM demonstrates superior performance in tasks such as classification, regression, interpolation, and extrapolation, while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Compact Model for Large-Scale Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20634v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal data, which commonly arise in real-world applications such as traffic monitoring, financial transactions, and ride-share demands, represent a special category of multivariate time series. They exhibit two distinct characteristics: high dimensionality and commensurability across spatial locations. These attributes call for computationally efficient modeling approaches and facilitate the use of univariate forecasting models in a channel-independent fashion. SparseTSF, a recently introduced competitive univariate forecasting model, harnesses periodicity to achieve compactness by concentrating on cross-period dynamics, thereby extending the Pareto frontier with respect to model size and predictive performance. Nonetheless, it underperforms on spatio-temporal data due to an inadequate capture of intra-period temporal dependencies. To address this shortcoming, we propose UltraSTF, which integrates a cross-period forecasting module with an ultra-compact shape bank component. Our model effectively detects recurring patterns in time series through the attention mechanism of the shape bank component, thereby strengthening its ability to learn intra-period dynamics. UltraSTF achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LargeST benchmark while employing fewer than 0.2% of the parameters required by the second-best approaches, thus further extending the Pareto frontier of existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating System 1 vs. 2 Reasoning Approaches for Zero-Shot Time-Series Forecasting: A Benchmark and Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01895v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning ability is crucial for solving challenging tasks. With the advancement of foundation models, such as the emergence of large language models (LLMs), a wide range of reasoning strategies has been proposed, including test-time enhancements, such as Chain-ofThought, and post-training optimizations, as used in DeepSeek-R1. While these reasoning strategies have demonstrated effectiveness across various challenging language or vision tasks, their applicability and impact on time-series forecasting (TSF), particularly the challenging zero-shot TSF, remain largely unexplored. In particular, it is unclear whether zero-shot TSF benefits from reasoning and, if so, what types of reasoning strategies are most effective. To bridge this gap, we propose ReC4TS, the first benchmark that systematically evaluates the effectiveness of popular reasoning strategies when applied to zero-shot TSF tasks. ReC4TS conducts comprehensive evaluations across datasets spanning eight domains, covering both unimodal and multimodal with short-term and longterm forecasting tasks. More importantly, ReC4TS provides key insights: (1) Self-consistency emerges as the most effective test-time reasoning strategy; (2) Group-relative policy optimization emerges as a more suitable approach for incentivizing reasoning ability during post-training; (3) Multimodal TSF benefits more from reasoning strategies compared to unimodal TSF. Beyond these insights, ReC4TS establishes two pioneering starting blocks to support future zero-shot TSF reasoning research: (1) A novel dataset, TimeThinking, containing forecasting samples annotated with reasoning trajectories from multiple advanced LLMs, and (2) A new and simple test-time scaling-law validated on foundational TSF models enabled by self-consistency reasoning strategy.

Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers are now developing Large Time Series Models (LTSMs)-universal transformer-based models that use autoregressive prediction-to improve TSF. However, training LTSMs on heterogeneous time series data poses unique challenges, including diverse frequencies, dimensions, and patterns across datasets. Recent endeavors have studied and evaluated various design choices aimed at enhancing LTSM training and generalization capabilities. However, these design choices are typically studied and evaluated in isolation and are not benchmarked collectively. In this work, we introduce LTSM-Bundle, a comprehensive toolbox, and benchmark for training LTSMs, spanning pre-processing techniques, model configurations, and dataset configuration. It modularized and benchmarked LTSMs from multiple dimensions, encompassing prompting strategies, tokenization approaches, training paradigms, base model selection, data quantity, and dataset diversity. Furthermore, we combine the most effective design choices identified in our study. Empirical results demonstrate that this combination achieves superior zero-shot and few-shot performances compared to state-of-the-art LTSMs and traditional TSF methods on benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, despite deep learning advancements, traditional Transformer-based models often diminish the effect of crucial inter-variable relationships by singular token embedding and struggle to effectively capture complex dependencies among variables, especially in datasets with rare or extreme events. These events create significant imbalances and lead to high skewness, complicating accurate prediction efforts. This study introduces PFformer, a position-free Transformer-based model designed for single-target MTS forecasting, specifically for challenging datasets characterized by extreme variability. PFformer integrates two novel embedding strategies: Enhanced Feature-based Embedding (EFE) and Auto-Encoder-based Embedding (AEE). EFE effectively encodes inter-variable dependencies by mapping related sequence subsets to high-dimensional spaces without positional constraints, enhancing the encoder's functionality. PFformer shows superior forecasting accuracy without the traditional limitations of positional encoding in MTS modeling. We evaluated PFformer across four challenging datasets, focusing on two key forecasting scenarios: long sequence prediction for 3 days ahead and rolling predictions every four hours to reflect real-time decision-making processes in water management. PFformer demonstrated remarkable improvements, from 20% to 60%, compared with state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>PAKDD...</summary><p>PAKDD 2025 special session on Data Science: Foundations and Applications (DSFA)</p></details> |

To mitigate the possibility of disruptive faults resulting in a power outage, monitoring contamination and leakage current can help predict the progression of faults. Given this need, this paper proposes a hybrid deep learning (DL) model for predicting the increase in leakage current in high-voltage insulators. The hybrid structure considers a multi-criteria optimization using tree-structured Parzen estimation, an input stage filter for signal noise attenuation combined with a large language model (LLM) applied for time series forecasting. The proposed optimized LLM outperforms state-of-the-art DL models with a root-mean-square error equal to 2.24$\times10^{-4}$ for a short-term horizon and 1.21$\times10^{-3}$ for a medium-term horizon.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a novel method for efficiently computing the signature kernel of long, high-dimensional time series via dynamically truncated recursive local power series expansions. Building on the characterization of the signature kernel as the solution of a Goursat PDE, our approach employs tilewise Neumann-series expansions to derive rapidly converging power series approximations of the signature kernel that are locally defined on subdomains and propagated iteratively across the entire domain of the Goursat solution by exploiting the geometry of the time series. Algorithmically, this involves solving a system of interdependent local Goursat PDEs by recursively propagating boundary conditions along a directed graph via topological ordering, with dynamic truncation adaptively terminating each local power series expansion when coefficients fall below machine precision, striking an effective balance between computational cost and accuracy. This method achieves substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art approaches for computing the signature kernel, providing (a) adjustable and superior accuracy, even for time series with very high roughness; (b) drastically reduced memory requirements; and (c) scalability to efficiently handle very long time series (e.g., with up to half a million points or more) on a single GPU. These advantages make our method particularly well-suited for rough-path-assisted machine learning, financial modeling, and signal processing applications that involve very long and highly volatile data.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |

Recent literature on EMG artifact removal has moved beyond traditional linear algorithms in favor of machine learning-based systems. However, existing deep learning-based filtration methods often have large compute footprints and prohibitively long training times. In this study, we present a new machine learning-based system for filtering EMG interference from EEG data using an autoencoder-targeted adversarial transformer (AT-AT). By leveraging the lightweight expressivity of an autoencoder to determine optimal time-series transformer application sites, our AT-AT architecture achieves a >90% model size reduction compared to published artifact removal models. The addition of adversarial training ensures that filtered signals adhere to the fundamental characteristics of EEG data. We trained AT-AT using published neural data from 67 subjects and found that the system was able to achieve comparable test performance to larger models; AT-AT posted a mean reconstructive correlation coefficient above 0.95 at an initial signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 2 dB and 0.70 at -7 dB SNR. Further research generalizing these results to broader sample sizes beyond these isolated test cases will be crucial; while outside the scope of this study, we also include results from a real-world deployment of AT-AT in the Appendix.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CNS 2025, Boston, MA, USA</p></details> |

Dedicated hardware implementations based on functional neuromorphic structures significantly reduce energy consumption and/or increase computational capabilities of a given artificial neural network system. Concepts of RC, which as a flexible computational paradigm can be highly inclusive, are often used as a model to describe computations performed in materia. With mostly fixed internal structure, solid-state devices, especially memristors, are studied as computational substrates in various RC systems. In this work, we present single-node Echo State Machine (SNESM) RC system based on bridge synapse as a computational substrate (consisting of 4 memristors and a differential amplifier) used for epileptic seizure detection. KNOWM memristors were posed as ideal candidates because of their easy prototyping and reliability of operation. In this account, we present an application of commercially available KNOWM memristors in various neuromorphic applications, from simple analysis of switching and internal dynamics (elucidated form noise spectroscopy and total harmonic distortion analysis) to the classification and recognition of complex time series: epilepsy seizure recognition using a wrist-worn triaxial accelerometer.</p></details> |  |

Due to the time series data, the use of $\ell_1$ regularization quickly becomes intractable for many solvers, and, despite the reconstruction advantages of $\ell_1$ regularization, $\ell_2$-based approaches such as sLORETA are used in practice. In this work, we formulate EEG source localization as a graphical generalized elastic net inverse problem and present a variable projected algorithm (VPAL) suitable for fast EEG source localization. We prove convergence of this solver for a broad class of separable convex, potentially non-smooth functions subject to linear constraints and include a modification of VPAL that reconstructs time points in sequence, suitable for real-time reconstruction. Our proposed methods are compared to state-of-the-art approaches including sLORETA and other methods for $\ell_1$-regularized inverse problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Canonical Decomposition of Factor Models: Weak Factors are Everywhere](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10067v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are two approaches to time series approximate factor models: the static factor model, where the factors are loaded contemporaneously by the common component, and the Generalised Dynamic Factor Model, where the factors are loaded with lags. In this paper we derive a canonical decomposition which nests both models by introducing the weak common component which is the difference between the dynamic- and the static common component. Such component is driven by potentially infinitely many non-pervasive weak factors which live in the dynamically common space (not to be confused with rate-weak factors, being pervasive but associated with a slower rate). Our result shows that the relation between the two approaches is far more rich and complex than what usually assumed. We exemplify why the weak common component shall not be neglected by means of theoretical and empirical examples. Furthermore, we propose a simple estimation procedure for the canonical decomposition. Our empirical estimates on US macroeconomic data reveal that the weak common component can account for a large part of the variation of individual variables. Furthermore in a pseudo real-time forecasting evaluation for industrial production and inflation, we show that gains can be obtained from considering the dynamic approach over the static approach.</p></details> |  |

We represent images as matrix data and allow for temporal dependence, in addition to inherent spatial dependence, before and after the change. The marginal distributions are assumed to be general, not limited to any specific parametric distribution. We propose new monitoring statistics that utilize the low-rank structure of the in-control mean matrix. Additionally, we study the properties of the proposed detection procedure, assessing whether the monitoring statistics effectively capture a mean shift and evaluating the rate of increase in the average run length relative to the control limit in both the in-control and out-of-control cases. The effectiveness of our procedure is demonstrated through simulated and real data experiments.</p></details> | 30 pages, 7 figures |

While surgical intervention is often essential to prevent fatal outcomes, it carries significant risks both during the procedure and in the postoperative period, making the management of these conditions highly challenging. Parameters of cerebral blood flow, routinely monitored during medical interventions or with modern noninvasive high-resolution imaging methods, could potentially be utilized in machine learning-assisted protocols for risk assessment and therapeutic prognosis. To this end, we developed a linear oscillatory model of blood velocity and pressure for clinical data acquired from neurosurgical operations. Using the method of Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy), the parameters of our model can be reconstructed online within milliseconds from a short time series of the hemodynamic variables. The identified parameter values enable automated classification of the blood-flow pathologies by means of logistic regression, achieving an accuracy of 73 \%}. Our results demonstrate the potential of this model for both diagnostic and prognostic applications, providing a robust and interpretable framework for assessing cerebral blood vessel conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 main figures, 5 supplementary figures, 2 supplementary tables</p></details> |

By combining the multi-resolution framework of wavelets with the robustness of the Least Absolute Deviations (LAD) criterion, we introduce a periodogram providing a robust alternative to classical methods in the presence of non-Gaussian noise. Incorporating this periodogram into a log-periodogram regression, we develop a new estimator. Simulation studies demonstrate that our estimator outperforms the Geweke and Porter-Hudak (GPH) and Wavelet-Based Log-Periodogram (WBLP) estimators, particularly in terms of mean squared error, across various sample sizes and parameter configurations.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |

The SINDYc model has been trained on data coming from a nonlinear magnetic equivalent circuit model for three rotor eccentricity configurations. When evaluating the SINDYc model for static eccentricity, torques and UMPs with excellent accuracies, i.e., 8.8 mNm and 4.87 N of mean absolute error, respectively, are found. When compared with a reference torque equation, this amounts to a 65% error reduction. For dynamic eccentricity, the estimation is more difficult. The SINDYc model is fast enough to be embedded in a control procedure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Time Series Forecasting via Hyper-Complex Models and Frequency Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19983v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is a long-standing problem in statistics and machine learning. One of the key challenges is processing sequences with long-range dependencies. To that end, a recent line of work applied the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), which partitions the sequence into multiple subsequences and applies a Fourier transform to each separately. We propose the Frequency Information Aggregation (FIA)-Net, which is based on a novel complex-valued MLP architecture that aggregates adjacent window information in the frequency domain. To further increase the receptive field of the FIA-Net, we treat the set of windows as hyper-complex (HC) valued vectors and employ HC algebra to efficiently combine information from all STFT windows altogether. Using the HC-MLP backbone allows for improved handling of sequences with long-term dependence. Furthermore, due to the nature of HC operations, the HC-MLP uses up to three times fewer parameters than the equivalent standard window aggregation method. We evaluate the FIA-Net on various time-series benchmarks and show that the proposed methodologies outperform existing state of the art methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Our code is publicly available on https://anonymous.4open.science/r/research-1803/.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Forecasting intermittent time series with Gaussian Processes and Tweedie likelihood](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19086v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the use of Gaussian Processes (GPs) for the probabilistic forecasting of intermittent time series. The model is trained in a Bayesian framework that accounts for the uncertainty about the latent function and marginalizes it out when making predictions. We couple the latent GP variable with two types of forecast distributions: the negative binomial (NegBinGP) and the Tweedie distribution (TweedieGP). While the negative binomial has already been used in forecasting intermittent time series, this is the first time in which a fully parameterized Tweedie density is used for intermittent time series. We properly evaluate the Tweedie density, which is both zero-inflated and heavy tailed, avoiding simplifying assumptions made in existing models. We test our models on thousands of intermittent count time series. Results show that our models provide consistently better probabilistic forecasts than the competitors. In particular, TweedieGP obtains the best estimates of the highest quantiles, thus showing that it is more flexible than NegBinGP.</p></details> | Under review |

Such clinical applications are increasingly supported by machine learning methods, raising the question of the most appropriate input representation and model choice. Comprehensive comparisons, in particular across different input representations, are scarce. We address this gap in the research landscape by a comprehensive benchmarking study covering three kinds of input representations, interpretable features, image representations and raw waveforms, across prototypical regression and classification use cases: blood pressure and atrial fibrillation prediction. In both cases, the best results are achieved by deep neural networks operating on raw time series as input representations. Within this model class, best results are achieved by modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs). but depending on the task setup, shallow CNNs are often also very competitive. We envision that these results will be insightful for researchers to guide their choice on machine learning tasks for PPG data, even beyond the use cases presented in this work.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 9 figures, code available at https://gitlab.com/qumphy/d1-code</p></details> |

While recent techniques seek to address this for images, our findings show that these approaches fail to provide shift-invariance in time series, where the data generation mechanism is more challenging due to the interaction of low and high frequencies. Worse, they also decrease performance across several tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel differentiable bijective function that maps samples from their high-dimensional data manifold to another manifold of the same dimension, without any dimensional reduction. Our approach guarantees that samples -- when subjected to random shifts -- are mapped to a unique point in the manifold while preserving all task-relevant information without loss. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that the proposed transformation guarantees shift-invariance in deep learning models without imposing any limits to the shift. Our experiments on six time series tasks with state-of-the-art methods show that our approach consistently improves the performance while enabling models to achieve complete shift-invariance without modifying or imposing restrictions on the model's topology.

| **[Time-MoE: Billion-Scale Time Series Foundation Models with Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16040v4)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning for time series forecasting has seen significant advancements over the past decades. However, despite the success of large-scale pre-training in language and vision domains, pre-trained time series models remain limited in scale and operate at a high cost, hindering the development of larger capable forecasting models in real-world applications. In response, we introduce Time-MoE, a scalable and unified architecture designed to pre-train larger, more capable forecasting foundation models while reducing inference costs. By leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) design, Time-MoE enhances computational efficiency by activating only a subset of networks for each prediction, reducing computational load while maintaining high model capacity. This allows Time-MoE to scale effectively without a corresponding increase in inference costs. Time-MoE comprises a family of decoder-only transformer models that operate in an auto-regressive manner and support flexible forecasting horizons with varying input context lengths. We pre-trained these models on our newly introduced large-scale data Time-300B, which spans over 9 domains and encompassing over 300 billion time points. For the first time, we scaled a time series foundation model up to 2.4 billion parameters, achieving significantly improved forecasting precision. Our results validate the applicability of scaling laws for training tokens and model size in the context of time series forecasting. Compared to dense models with the same number of activated parameters or equivalent computation budgets, our models consistently outperform them by large margin. These advancements position Time-MoE as a state-of-the-art solution for tackling real-world time series forecasting challenges with superior capability, efficiency, and flexibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Automatic Temporal Segmentation for Post-Stroke Rehabilitation: A Keypoint Detection and Temporal Segmentation Approach for Small Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19766v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rehabilitation is essential and critical for post-stroke patients, addressing both physical and cognitive aspects. Stroke predominantly affects older adults, with 75% of cases occurring in individuals aged 65 and older, underscoring the urgent need for tailored rehabilitation strategies in aging populations. Despite the critical role therapists play in evaluating rehabilitation progress and ensuring the effectiveness of treatment, current assessment methods can often be subjective, inconsistent, and time-consuming, leading to delays in adjusting therapy protocols. This study aims to address these challenges by providing a solution for consistent and timely analysis. Specifically, we perform temporal segmentation of video recordings to capture detailed activities during stroke patients' rehabilitation. The main application scenario motivating this study is the clinical assessment of daily tabletop object interactions, which are crucial for post-stroke physical rehabilitation. To achieve this, we present a framework that leverages the biomechanics of movement during therapy sessions. Our solution divides the process into two main tasks: 2D keypoint detection to track patients' physical movements, and 1D time-series temporal segmentation to analyze these movements over time. This dual approach enables automated labeling with only a limited set of real-world data, addressing the challenges of variability in patient movements and limited dataset availability. By tackling these issues, our method shows strong potential for practical deployment in physical therapy settings, enhancing the speed and accuracy of rehabilitation assessments.</p></details> |  |
| **[BatteryLife: A Comprehensive Dataset and Benchmark for Battery Life Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18807v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Battery Life Prediction (BLP), which relies on time series data produced by battery degradation tests, is crucial for battery utilization, optimization, and production. Despite impressive advancements, this research area faces three key challenges. Firstly, the limited size of existing datasets impedes insights into modern battery life data. Secondly, most datasets are restricted to small-capacity lithium-ion batteries tested under a narrow range of diversity in labs, raising concerns about the generalizability of findings. Thirdly, inconsistent and limited benchmarks across studies obscure the effectiveness of baselines and leave it unclear if models popular in other time series fields are effective for BLP. To address these challenges, we propose BatteryLife, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for BLP. BatteryLife integrates 16 datasets, offering a 2.4 times sample size compared to the previous largest dataset, and provides the most diverse battery life resource with batteries from 8 formats, 80 chemical systems, 12 operating temperatures, and 646 charge/discharge protocols, including both laboratory and industrial tests. Notably, BatteryLife is the first to release battery life datasets of zinc-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and industry-tested large-capacity lithium-ion batteries. With the comprehensive dataset, we revisit the effectiveness of baselines popular in this and other time series fields. Furthermore, we propose CyclePatch, a plug-in technique that can be employed in a series of neural networks. Extensive benchmarking of 18 methods reveals that models popular in other time series fields can be unsuitable for BLP, and CyclePatch consistently improves model performance establishing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Moreover, BatteryLife evaluates model performance across aging conditions and domains. BatteryLife is available at https://github.com/Ruifeng-Tan/BatteryLife.</p></details> | Under review |

The intersection of these two fields, termed diffusion models for anomaly detection (DMAD), offers promising solutions for identifying deviations in increasingly complex and high-dimensional data. In this survey, we review recent advances in DMAD research. We begin by presenting the fundamental concepts of AD and DMs, followed by a comprehensive analysis of classic DM architectures including DDPMs, DDIMs, and Score SDEs. We further categorize existing DMAD methods into reconstruction-based, density-based, and hybrid approaches, providing detailed examinations of their methodological innovations. We also explore the diverse tasks across different data modalities, encompassing image, time series, video, and multimodal data analysis. Furthermore, we discuss critical challenges and emerging research directions, including computational efficiency, model interpretability, robustness enhancement, edge-cloud collaboration, and integration with large language models.

Nonetheless, it remains unclear how to adapt these models to generate long multivariate time series. Viewing a time series as the discretisation of an underlying continuous process, we introduce SigDiffusion, a novel diffusion model operating on log-signature embeddings of the data. The forward and backward processes gradually perturb and denoise log-signatures while preserving their algebraic structure. To recover a signal from its log-signature, we provide new closed-form inversion formulae expressing the coefficients obtained by expanding the signal in a given basis (e.g. Fourier or orthogonal polynomials) as explicit polynomial functions of the log-signature. Finally, we show that combining SigDiffusions with these inversion formulae results in high-quality long time series generation, competitive with the current state-of-the-art on various datasets of synthetic and real-world examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Resting-state fMRI, a non-invasive tool for capturing brain connectivity patterns, aids in early ASD diagnosis and differentiation from typical controls (TC). However, previous methods, which rely on either mean time series or full 4D data, are limited by a lack of spatial information or by high computational costs. This underscores the need for an efficient solution that preserves both spatial and temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel, simple, and efficient spatial-temporal-omics learning framework designed to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from fMRI for ASD classification. Our approach addresses these limitations by utilizing 3D time-domain derivatives as the spatial-temporal inter-voxel omics, which preserve full spatial resolution while capturing diverse statistical characteristics of the time series at each voxel. Meanwhile, functional connectivity features serve as the spatial-temporal inter-regional omics, capturing correlations across brain regions. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms previous methods while maintaining computational efficiency. We believe our research offers valuable insights that will inform and advance future ASD studies, particularly in the realm of spatial-temporal-omics-based learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)</p></details> |

Analyzing it involves tasks such as classification, clustering, prototyping, and regression. Classification identifies normal vs. abnormal movements in skeleton-based motion sequences, clustering detects stock market behavior patterns, prototyping expands physical therapy datasets, and regression predicts patient recovery. Deep learning has recently gained traction in time series analysis due to its success in other domains. This thesis leverages deep learning to enhance classification with feature engineering, introduce foundation models, and develop a compact yet state-of-the-art architecture. We also address limited labeled data with self-supervised learning. Our contributions apply to real-world tasks, including human motion analysis for action recognition and rehabilitation. We introduce a generative model for human motion data, valuable for cinematic production and gaming. For prototyping, we propose a shape-based synthetic sample generation method to support regression models when data is scarce. Lastly, we critically evaluate discriminative and generative models, identifying limitations in current methodologies and advocating for a robust, standardized evaluation framework. Our experiments on public datasets provide novel insights and methodologies, advancing time series analysis with practical applications.</p></details> |  |

Numerical models, such as MEDSLIK-II, simulate advection, dispersion, and transformation processes of oil particles. However, simulations heavily rely on accurate parameter tuning, still based on expert knowledge and manual calibration. To overcome these limitations, we integrate the MEDSLIK-II numerical oil spill model with a Bayesian optimization framework to iteratively estimate the best physical parameter configuration that yields simulation closer to satellite observations of the slick. We focus on key parameters, such as horizontal diffusivity and drift factor, maximizing the Fraction Skill Score (FSS) as a measure of spatio-temporal overlap between simulated and observed oil distributions. We validate the framework for the Baniyas oil incident that occurred in Syria between August 23 and September 4, 2021, which released over 12,000 $m^3$ of oil. We show that, on average, the proposed approach systematically improves the FSS from 5.82% to 11.07% compared to control simulations initialized with default parameters. The optimization results in consistent improvement across multiple time steps, particularly during periods of increased drift variability, demonstrating the robustness of our method in dynamic environmental conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, research paper</p></details> |

Although many methods have been explored, they assign correlation coefficients to surrounding agents in a purely learning-based manner. In this study, we present ASPILin, which manually selects interacting agents and replaces the attention scores in Transformer with a newly computed physical correlation coefficient, enhancing the interpretability of interaction modeling. Surprisingly, these simple modifications can significantly improve prediction performance and substantially reduce computational costs. We intentionally simplified our model in other aspects, such as map encoding. Remarkably, experiments conducted on the INTERACTION, highD, and CitySim datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code:https://github.com/kkk00714/ASPILin</p></details> |

However, concerns about the reliability of the content they generate persist, as it frequently deviates from factual correctness or exhibits deficiencies in logical reasoning. This paper proposes a novel decoding strategy aimed at enhancing both factual accuracy and inferential reasoning without requiring any modifications to the architecture or pre-trained parameters of LLMs. Our approach adjusts next-token probabilities by analyzing the trajectory of logits from lower to higher layers in Transformers and applying linear regression. We find that this Decoding by Logit Trajectory-based approach (DeLTa) effectively reinforces factuality and reasoning while mitigating incorrect generation. Experiments on TruthfulQA demonstrate that DeLTa attains up to a 4.9% improvement over the baseline. Furthermore, it enhances performance by up to 8.1% on StrategyQA and 7.3% on GSM8K, both of which demand strong reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code is available at https://github.com/githubhyz/DeLTa</p></details> |

Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end. DiffTORI addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTORI is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTORI for imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with high-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feed-forward policy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion. Across 15 model-based RL tasks and 35 imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional image and point cloud inputs, DiffTORI outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both domains.

| **[Quantifying Point Contributions: A Lightweight Framework for Efficient and Effective Query-Driven Trajectory Simplification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02047v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large volumes of trajectory data accumulate, simplifying trajectories to reduce storage and querying costs is increasingly studied. Existing proposals face three main problems. First, they require numerous iterations to decide which GPS points to delete. Second, they focus only on the relationships between neighboring points (local information) while neglecting the overall structure (global information), reducing the global similarity between the simplified and original trajectories and making it difficult to maintain consistency in query results, especially for similarity-based queries. Finally, they fail to differentiate the importance of points with similar features, leading to suboptimal selection of points to retain the original trajectory information. We propose MLSimp, a novel Mutual Learning query-driven trajectory simplification framework that integrates two distinct models: GNN-TS, based on graph neural networks, and Diff-TS, based on diffusion models. GNN-TS evaluates the importance of a point according to its globality, capturing its correlation with the entire trajectory, and its uniqueness, capturing its differences from neighboring points. It also incorporates attention mechanisms in the GNN layers, enabling simultaneous data integration from all points within the same trajectory and refining representations, thus avoiding iterative processes. Diff-TS generates amplified signals to enable the retention of the most important points at low compression rates. Experiments involving eight baselines on three databases show that MLSimp reduces the simplification time by 42%--70% and improves query accuracy over simplified trajectories by up to 34.6%.</p></details> | Accepted by VLDB2025 |
| **[Density estimation with LLMs: a geometric investigation of in-context learning trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05218v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable emergent abilities to perform in-context learning across various tasks, including time series forecasting. This work investigates LLMs' ability to estimate probability density functions (PDFs) from data observed in-context; such density estimation (DE) is a fundamental task underlying many probabilistic modeling problems. We leverage the Intensive Principal Component Analysis (InPCA) to visualize and analyze the in-context learning dynamics of LLaMA-2 models. Our main finding is that these LLMs all follow similar learning trajectories in a low-dimensional InPCA space, which are distinct from those of traditional density estimation methods like histograms and Gaussian kernel density estimation (KDE). We interpret the LLaMA in-context DE process as a KDE with an adaptive kernel width and shape. This custom kernel model captures a significant portion of LLaMA's behavior despite having only two parameters. We further speculate on why LLaMA's kernel width and shape differs from classical algorithms, providing insights into the mechanism of in-context probabilistic reasoning in LLMs. Our codebase, along with a 3D visualization of an LLM's in-context learning trajectory, is publicly available at https://github.com/AntonioLiu97/LLMICL_inPCA</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches rely on expensive human annotation, making them unsustainable at scale. We propose AgentTrek, a scalable data synthesis pipeline that generates web agent trajectories by leveraging publicly available tutorials. Our three-stage method: (1) automatically harvests and filters tutorial-like texts from the internet using a specialized classification model, (2) transforms these texts into structured task specifications with step-by-step instructions, and (3) employs a visual-language model (VLM) agent to execute these instructions in real environments, while a VLM-based evaluator verifies trajectory correctness. The synthesized trajectories encompass multiple modalities, including text-based HTML observations with function-calling API actions, and vision-based screenshot observations with pixel-level actions. This multimodal data, enriched with chain-of-thought reasoning, enables agents to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both textual web browsing benchmarks (e.g., WebArena) and visual web grounding and browsing benchmarks (e.g., ScreenSpot Web and Multimodal Mind2Web). Furthermore, our fully automated approach significantly reduces data collection costs, achieving a cost of just $0.55 per high-quality trajectory without human annotators. Our work demonstrates that guided replay using web tutorials is a practical and scalable strategy for training advanced GUI agents, paving the way for more capable and autonomous digital assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR2...</summary><p>ICLR2025 Spotlight https://agenttrek.github.io</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a new task goal identification from observed UI trajectories aiming to infer the user's detailed intentions when performing a task within UI environments. To support this task, we also introduce a novel evaluation methodology designed to assess whether two intent descriptions can be considered paraphrases within a specific UI environment. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this task can leverage datasets designed for the inverse problem of UI automation, utilizing Android and web datasets for our experiments. To benchmark this task, we compare the performance of humans and state-of-the-art models, specifically GPT-4 and Gemini-1.5 Pro, using our proposed metric. The results reveal that both Gemini and GPT underperform relative to human performance, underscoring the challenge of the proposed task and the significant room for improvement. This work highlights the importance of goal identification within UI trajectories, providing a foundation for further exploration and advancement in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-Class-Aware Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01440v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of multi-agent reinforcement learning, generalization is a challenge to solve various tasks that may require different joint policies or coordination without relying on policies specialized for each task. We refer to this type of problem as a multi-task, and we train agents to be versatile in this multi-task setting through a single training process. To address this challenge, we introduce TRajectory-class-Aware Multi-Agent reinforcement learning (TRAMA). In TRAMA, agents recognize a task type by identifying the class of trajectories they are experiencing through partial observations, and the agents use this trajectory awareness or prediction as additional information for action policy. To this end, we introduce three primary objectives in TRAMA: (a) constructing a quantized latent space to generate trajectory embeddings that reflect key similarities among them; (b) conducting trajectory clustering using these trajectory embeddings; and (c) building a trajectory-class-aware policy. Specifically for (c), we introduce a trajectory-class predictor that performs agent-wise predictions on the trajectory class; and we design a trajectory-class representation model for each trajectory class. Each agent takes actions based on this trajectory-class representation along with its partial observation for task-aware execution. The proposed method is evaluated on various tasks, including multi-task problems built upon StarCraft II. Empirical results show further performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Data-Driven Aggressive Autonomous Racing Framework Utilizing Local Trajectory Planning with Velocity Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11570v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of autonomous driving has boosted the research on autonomous racing. However, existing local trajectory planning methods have difficulty planning trajectories with optimal velocity profiles at racetracks with sharp corners, thus weakening the performance of autonomous racing. To address this problem, we propose a local trajectory planning method that integrates Velocity Prediction based on Model Predictive Contouring Control (VPMPCC). The optimal parameters of VPMPCC are learned through Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on a proposed novel Objective Function adapted to Racing (OFR). Specifically, VPMPCC achieves velocity prediction by encoding the racetrack as a reference velocity profile and incorporating it into the optimization problem. This method optimizes the velocity profile of local trajectories, especially at corners with significant curvature. The proposed OFR balances racing performance with vehicle safety, ensuring safe and efficient BO training. In the simulation, the number of training iterations for OFR-based BO is reduced by 42.86% compared to the state-of-the-art method. The optimal simulation-trained parameters are then applied to a real-world F1TENTH vehicle without retraining. During prolonged racing on a custom-built racetrack featuring significant sharp corners, the mean projected velocity of VPMPCC reaches 93.18% of the vehicle's handling limits. The released code is available at https://github.com/zhouhengli/VPMPCC.</p></details> |  |
| **[GDTS: Goal-Guided Diffusion Model with Tree Sampling for Multi-Modal Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14922v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of pedestrian trajectories is crucial for improving the safety of autonomous driving. However, this task is generally nontrivial due to the inherent stochasticity of human motion, which naturally requires the predictor to generate multi-modal prediction. Previous works leverage various generative methods, such as GAN and VAE, for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Nevertheless, these methods may suffer from mode collapse and relatively low-quality results. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has recently been applied to trajectory prediction due to its simple training process and powerful reconstruction ability. However, current diffusion-based methods do not fully utilize input information and usually require many denoising iterations that lead to a long inference time or an additional network for initialization. To address these challenges and facilitate the use of diffusion models in multi-modal trajectory prediction, we propose GDTS, a novel Goal-Guided Diffusion Model with Tree Sampling for multi-modal trajectory prediction. Considering the "goal-driven" characteristics of human motion, GDTS leverages goal estimation to guide the generation of the diffusion network. A two-stage tree sampling algorithm is presented, which leverages common features to reduce the inference time and improve accuracy for multi-modal prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance with real-time inference speed in public datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Learn Weight Generation via Trajectory Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01117v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based algorithms have emerged as promising techniques for weight generation, particularly in scenarios like multi-task learning that require frequent weight updates. However, existing solutions suffer from limited cross-task transferability. In addition, they only utilize optimal weights as training samples, ignoring the value of other weights in the optimization process. To address these issues, we propose Lt-Di, which integrates the diffusion algorithm with meta-learning to generate weights for unseen tasks. Furthermore, we extend the vanilla diffusion algorithm into a trajectory diffusion algorithm to utilize other weights along the optimization trajectory. Trajectory diffusion decomposes the entire diffusion chain into multiple shorter ones, improving training and inference efficiency. We analyze the convergence properties of the weight generation paradigm and improve convergence efficiency without additional time overhead. Our experiments demonstrate Lt-Di's higher accuracy while reducing computational overhead across various tasks, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, multi-domain generalization, and large-scale language model fine-tuning.Our code is released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Lt-Di-0E51.</p></details> |  |

Our approach addresses the complex dynamics of a system in which a team of quadrotors transports and manipulates a cable-suspended rigid-body payload in environments cluttered with obstacles. The proposed algorithm ensures obstacle avoidance for the entire system, including the quadrotors, cables, and the payload in all six degrees of freedom (DoF). We introduce the use of CBFs to enable safe and smooth maneuvers, effectively navigating through cluttered environments while accommodating the system's nonlinear dynamics. To simplify complex constraints, the system components are modeled as convex polytopes, and the Duality theorem is employed to reduce the computational complexity of the optimization problem. We validate the performance of our planning approach both in simulation and real-world environments using multiple quadrotors. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving obstacle avoidance and safe trajectory generation for cooperative transportation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation(ICRA), 2025.

| **[Fast Finite-Time Sliding Mode Control for Chattering-Free Trajectory Tracking of Robotic Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16867v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving precise and efficient trajectory tracking in robotic arms remains a key challenge due to system uncertainties and chattering effects in conventional sliding mode control (SMC). This paper presents a chattering-free fast terminal sliding mode control (FTSMC) strategy for a three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) robotic arm, designed to enhance tracking accuracy and robustness while ensuring finite-time convergence. The control framework is developed using Newton-Euler dynamics, followed by a state-space representation that captures the system's angular position and velocity. By incorporating an improved sliding surface and a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, the proposed FTSMC effectively mitigates chattering while preserving the advantages of SMC, such as fast response and strong disturbance rejection. The controller's performance is rigorously evaluated through comparisons with conventional PD sliding mode control (PDSMC) and terminal sliding mode control (TSMC). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior trajectory tracking performance, faster convergence, and enhanced stability compared to existing methods, making it a promising solution for high-precision robotic applications.</p></details> |  |

However, extensive demonstrations are required for policy robustness and generalization. To reduce the demonstration reliance, we leverage spatial symmetry and propose ET-SEED, an efficient trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion model for generating action sequences in complex robot manipulation tasks. Further, previous equivariant diffusion models require the per-step equivariance in the Markov process, making it difficult to learn policy under such strong constraints. We theoretically extend equivariant Markov kernels and simplify the condition of equivariant diffusion process, thereby significantly improving training efficiency for trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion policy in an end-to-end manner. We evaluate ET-SEED on representative robotic manipulation tasks, involving rigid body, articulated and deformable object. Experiments demonstrate superior data efficiency and manipulation proficiency of our proposed method, as well as its ability to generalize to unseen configurations with only a few demonstrations.

Our proposal generalizes prior work by allowing the reference process in the Schr\"odinger Bridge problem to be a smooth Gaussian process, leading to more regular and interpretable trajectories in applications. Though na\"ively smoothing the reference process leads to a computationally intractable problem, we identify a class of processes (including the Mat\'ern processes) for which the resulting Smooth Schr\"odinger Bridge problem can be lifted to a simpler problem on phase space, which can be solved in polynomial time. We develop a practical approximation of this algorithm that outperforms existing methods on numerous simulated and real single-cell RNAseq datasets.

To further enhance temporal features, we introduce a Temporal Feature Enhancement Module, which integrates spectral features into temporal data using residual cross-attention. This enhanced temporal information is then employed for precise 3D trajectory estimation and classification.

In this paper, we present a solution for this problem using a novel drag-aware model formulation which is coupled with MPC, and therefore, enables tracking and landing during high-speed curvilinear trajectories of an USV without any communication. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our approach yields 40% decrease in prediction errors, and provides a 3-fold increase in certainty of predictions. Consequently, this leads to a 30% improvement in tracking performance and 40% higher success in landing on a moving USV even during aggressive turns that are unfeasible for conventional marine missions. We test our approach in two different real-world scenarios with marine vessels of two different sizes and further solidify our results through statistical analysis in simulation to demonstrate the robustness of our method.</p></details> |  |

To ensure safety, planners require reliable uncertainty estimates of the predicted behavior of surrounding agents, yet this aspect has received limited attention. In particular, decomposing uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic components is essential for distinguishing between inherent environmental randomness and model uncertainty, thereby enabling more robust and informed decision-making. This paper addresses the challenge of uncertainty modeling in trajectory prediction with a holistic approach that emphasizes uncertainty quantification, decomposition, and the impact of model composition. Our method, grounded in information theory, provides a theoretically principled way to measure uncertainty and decompose it into aleatoric and epistemic components. Unlike prior work, our approach is compatible with state-of-the-art motion predictors, allowing for broader applicability. We demonstrate its utility by conducting extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset, which shows how different architectures and configurations influence uncertainty quantification and model robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, submitted to International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> |

Supervised deep learning methods provide accurate road segmentation in the domain of their training data but cannot be trusted in out-of-distribution scenarios. Including the whole distribution in the trainset is challenging as each sample must be labeled by hand. Trajectory-based self-supervised methods offer a potential solution as they can learn from the traversed route without manual labels. However, existing trajectory-based methods use learning schemes that rely only on the camera or only on the lidar. In this paper, trajectory-based learning is implemented jointly with lidar and camera for increased performance. Our method outperforms recent standalone camera- and lidar-based methods when evaluated with a challenging winter driving dataset including countryside and suburb driving scenes.

Previous studies aim to predict gaze trajectories when humans are free-viewing an image, searching for required targets, or looking for clues to answer questions in an image. While these tasks focus on visual-centric scenarios, humans move their gaze also along with audio signal inputs in more common scenarios. To fill this gap, we introduce a new task that predicts human gaze trajectories in a visual scene with synchronized audio inputs and provide a new dataset containing 20k gaze points from 8 subjects. To effectively integrate audio information and simulate the dynamic process of human gaze motion, we propose a novel learning framework called EyEar (Eye moving while Ear listening) based on physics-informed dynamics, which considers three key factors to predict gazes: eye inherent motion tendency, vision salient attraction, and audio semantic attraction. We also propose a probability density score to overcome the high individual variability of gaze trajectories, thereby improving the stabilization of optimization and the reliability of the evaluation. Experimental results show that EyEar outperforms all the baselines in the context of all evaluation metrics, thanks to the proposed components in the learning model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Driven Data Generation for Contact-Rich Manipulation via Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20382v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a low-cost data generation pipeline that integrates physics-based simulation, human demonstrations, and model-based planning to efficiently generate large-scale, high-quality datasets for contact-rich robotic manipulation tasks. Starting with a small number of embodiment-flexible human demonstrations collected in a virtual reality simulation environment, the pipeline refines these demonstrations using optimization-based kinematic retargeting and trajectory optimization to adapt them across various robot embodiments and physical parameters. This process yields a diverse, physically consistent dataset that enables cross-embodiment data transfer, and offers the potential to reuse legacy datasets collected under different hardware configurations or physical parameters. We validate the pipeline's effectiveness by training diffusion policies from the generated datasets for challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks across multiple robot embodiments, including a floating Allegro hand and bimanual robot arms. The trained policies are deployed zero-shot on hardware for bimanual iiwa arms, achieving high success rates with minimal human input.

This paper introduces the Trajectory-to-Action Pipeline (TAP), a scalable and automated method for extracting SDL labels from large trajectory datasets. TAP applies a rules-based cross-entropy optimization approach to learn parameters directly from data, enhancing generalization across diverse driving contexts. Using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), TAP achieves 30% greater precision than Average Displacement Error (ADE) and 24% over Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in identifying behaviorally similar trajectories. Additionally, TAP enables automated detection of unique driving behaviors, streamlining safety evaluation processes for AV testing. This work provides a foundation for scalable scenario-based AV behavior analysis, with potential extensions for integrating multi-agent contexts.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[T1-PILOT: Optimized Trajectories for T1 Mapping Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20333v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiac T1 mapping provides critical quantitative insights into myocardial tissue composition, enabling the assessment of pathologies such as fibrosis, inflammation, and edema. However, the inherently dynamic nature of the heart imposes strict limits on acquisition times, making high-resolution T1 mapping a persistent challenge. Compressed sensing (CS) approaches have reduced scan durations by undersampling k-space and reconstructing images from partial data, and recent studies show that jointly optimizing the undersampling patterns with the reconstruction network can substantially improve performance. Still, most current T1 mapping pipelines rely on static, hand-crafted masks that do not exploit the full acceleration and accuracy potential. In this work, we introduce T1-PILOT: an end-to-end method that explicitly incorporates the T1 signal relaxation model into the sampling-reconstruction framework to guide the learning of non-Cartesian trajectories, crossframe alignment, and T1 decay estimation. Through extensive experiments on the CMRxRecon dataset, T1-PILOT significantly outperforms several baseline strategies (including learned single-mask and fixed radial or golden-angle sampling schemes), achieving higher T1 map fidelity at greater acceleration factors. In particular, we observe consistent gains in PSNR and VIF relative to existing methods, along with marked improvements in delineating finer myocardial structures. Our results highlight that optimizing sampling trajectories in tandem with the physical relaxation model leads to both enhanced quantitative accuracy and reduced acquisition times. Code for reproducing all results will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minds on the Move: Decoding Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Driving with Cognitive Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20084v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In mixed autonomous driving environments, accurately predicting the future trajectories of surrounding vehicles is crucial for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In driving scenarios, a vehicle's trajectory is determined by the decision-making process of human drivers. However, existing models primarily focus on the inherent statistical patterns in the data, often neglecting the critical aspect of understanding the decision-making processes of human drivers. This oversight results in models that fail to capture the true intentions of human drivers, leading to suboptimal performance in long-term trajectory prediction. To address this limitation, we introduce a Cognitive-Informed Transformer (CITF) that incorporates a cognitive concept, Perceived Safety, to interpret drivers' decision-making mechanisms. Perceived Safety encapsulates the varying risk tolerances across drivers with different driving behaviors. Specifically, we develop a Perceived Safety-aware Module that includes a Quantitative Safety Assessment for measuring the subject risk levels within scenarios, and Driver Behavior Profiling for characterizing driver behaviors. Furthermore, we present a novel module, Leanformer, designed to capture social interactions among vehicles. CITF demonstrates significant performance improvements on three well-established datasets. In terms of long-term prediction, it surpasses existing benchmarks by 12.0% on the NGSIM, 28.2% on the HighD, and 20.8% on the MoCAD dataset. Additionally, its robustness in scenarios with limited or missing data is evident, surpassing most state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, and paving the way for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

While recent learning-based methods, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in specific scenarios, RL planners struggle with training inefficiencies and managing large-scale, real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CarPlanner}, a \textbf{C}onsistent \textbf{a}uto-\textbf{r}egressive \textbf{Planner} that uses RL to generate multi-modal trajectories. The auto-regressive structure enables efficient large-scale RL training, while the incorporation of consistency ensures stable policy learning by maintaining coherent temporal consistency across time steps. Moreover, CarPlanner employs a generation-selection framework with an expert-guided reward function and an invariant-view module, simplifying RL training and enhancing policy performance. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our proposed RL framework effectively addresses the challenges of training efficiency and performance enhancement, positioning CarPlanner as a promising solution for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that the RL-based planner can surpass both IL- and rule-based state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on the challenging large-scale real-world dataset nuPlan. Our proposed CarPlanner surpasses RL-, IL-, and rule-based SOTA approaches within this demanding dataset.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Tracailer: An Efficient Trajectory Planner for Tractor-Trailer Vehicles in Unstructured Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19832v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tractor-trailer vehicle (robot) consists of a drivable tractor and one or more non-drivable trailers connected via hitches. Compared to typical car-like robots, the addition of trailers provides greater transportation capability. However, this also complicates motion planning due to the robot's complex kinematics, high-dimensional state space, and deformable structure. To efficiently plan safe, time-optimal trajectories that adhere to the kinematic constraints of the robot and address the challenges posed by its unique features, this paper introduces a lightweight, compact, and high-order smooth trajectory representation for tractor-trailer robots. Based on it, we design an efficiently solvable spatio-temporal trajectory optimization problem. To deal with deformable structures, which leads to difficulties in collision avoidance, we fully leverage the collision-free regions of the environment, directly applying deformations to trajectories in continuous space. This approach not requires constructing safe regions from the environment using convex approximations through collision-free seed points before each optimization, avoiding the loss of the solution space, thus reducing the dependency of the optimization on initial values. Moreover, a multi-terminal fast path search algorithm is proposed to generate the initial values for optimization. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves several-fold improvements in efficiency compared to existing algorithms, while also ensuring lower curvature and trajectory duration. Real-world experiments involving the transportation, loading and unloading of goods in both indoor and outdoor scenarios further validate the effectiveness of our method.

In this paper, a large signal model of the grid-connected VSG is first established. The trajectory reversing method (TRM) is then introduced to estimate the domain of attraction (DOA) of VSG. Subsequently, the transient instability mechanism is revealed in detail based on the estimated DOA boundary. The impacts of system parameters on the DOA range are further investigated. It is found that loss of synchronization (LOS) occurs if the system trajectory lies outside the post-fault DOA range. In scenarios where no equilibrium points exist after a grid fault, system stability can be reestablished only when the fault clearing angle (FCA) does not exceed the critical clearing angle (CCA). Finally, the CCA derived from the DOA and that from the conventional equal area criteria (EAC) are compared. The results show that CCA obtained by our solution has a higher accuracy. Time-domain simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed transient stability analysis method of grid-connected VSG.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,11 figures, references added</p></details> |

Reconstructing a point's 3D motion just from the images captured by only a monocular camera is unfeasible without prior assumptions. Under limited observation conditions such as insufficient observations, long distance, and high observation error of platform, the least squares estimation faces the issue of ill-conditioning. This paper presents an algorithm for reconstructing 3D trajectories of moving points using a monocular camera. The motion of the points is represented through temporal polynomials. Ridge estimation is introduced to mitigate the issues of ill-conditioning caused by limited observation conditions. Then, an automatic algorithm for determining the order of the temporal polynomials is proposed. Furthermore, the definition of reconstructability for temporal polynomials is proposed to describe the reconstruction accuracy quantitatively. The simulated and real-world experimental results demonstrate the feasibility, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

The conventional approaches typically focus on separate tasks such as trajectory prediction, imputation, or spatial-temporal recovery. Considering the unique formulation and constraint of each task, most existing methods are tailored for only one, limiting the ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, which is a common requirement in real-world scenarios. Another limitation is that widely used public datasets mainly focus on pedestrian movements with casual, loosely connected patterns, where interactions between individuals are not always present, especially at a long distance, making them less representative of more structured environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Unified Trajectory Generation model, UniTraj, that processes arbitrary trajectories as masked inputs, adaptable to diverse scenarios in the domain of sports games. Specifically, we introduce a Ghost Spatial Masking (GSM) module, embedded within a Transformer encoder, for spatial feature extraction. We further extend recent State Space Models (SSMs), known as the Mamba model, into a Bidirectional Temporal Mamba (BTM) to better capture temporal dependencies. Additionally, we incorporate a Bidirectional Temporal Scaled (BTS) module to thoroughly scan trajectories while preserving temporal missing relationships. Furthermore, we curate and benchmark three practical sports datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model. We hope that our work can advance the understanding of human movement in real-world applications, particularly in sports.

Prior works addressed this challenging problem under a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model with a gradient-driven drift in the observed space, introducing a minimum entropy estimator relative to the Wiener measure and a practical grid-free mean-field Langevin (MFL) algorithm using Schr\"odinger bridges. Motivated by the success of observable state space models in the traditional paired trajectory inference problem (e.g. target tracking), we extend the above framework to a class of latent SDEs in the form of observable state space models. In this setting, we use partial observations to infer trajectories in the latent space under a specified dynamics model (e.g. the constant velocity/acceleration models from target tracking). We introduce the PO-MFL algorithm to solve this latent trajectory inference problem and provide theoretical guarantees to the partially observed setting. Experiments validate the robustness of our method and the exponential convergence of the MFL dynamics, and demonstrate significant outperformance over the latent-free baseline in key scenarios.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Due to the potentially long distance of the UAV's flight, frequent handovers may be incurred among different GBSs, which leads to various practical issues such as large delay and synchronization overhead. To address this problem, we investigate the trajectory optimization of the UAV to minimize the number of GBS handovers during the flight, subject to a communication quality constraint and a maximum mission completion time constraint. Although this problem is non-convex and difficult to solve, we derive useful structures of the optimal solution, based on which we propose an efficient algorithm based on graph theory and Lagrangian relaxation for finding a high-quality suboptimal solution in polynomial time. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed trajectory design.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in IEEE Wireless Communications Letters</p></details> |

Unlike competing-event models, the events here are not mutually exclusive and often exhibit statistical dependencies. Existing approaches for multi-event survival analysis have generally been limited, most focusing on producing simple risk scores for each event, rather than the time-to-event itself. To overcome these issues, we introduce MENSA, a novel deep learning approach for multi-event survival analysis. MENSA jointly learns representations of the input features while capturing the complex dependence structure among events. In practice, it attempts to optimize the sum of the traditional negative log-likelihood across events and a novel trajectory-based likelihood, which encourages the model to learn the temporal order in which events occur. Experiments on real-world clinical datasets show that MENSA consistently gives good discrimination performances and accurate time-to-event predictions in single-event, competing-risk, and multi-event problems. Additionally, MENSA is more computationally-efficient, requiring fewer parameters and FLOPs than multiple state-of-the-art survival baselines when applied to large-dimensional datasets (more than 100 features).</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Augmentation for Instruction Following Policies via Trajectory Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01871v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scalability of instructable agents in robotics or gaming is often hindered by limited data that pairs instructions with agent trajectories. However, large datasets of unannotated trajectories containing sequences of various agent behaviour (play trajectories) are often available. In a semi-supervised setup, we explore methods to extract labelled segments from play trajectories. The goal is to augment a small annotated dataset of instruction-trajectory pairs to improve the performance of an instruction-following policy trained downstream via imitation learning. Assuming little variation in segment length, recent video segmentation methods can effectively extract labelled segments. To address the constraint of segment length, we propose Play Segmentation (PS), a probabilistic model that finds maximum likely segmentations of extended subsegments, while only being trained on individual instruction segments. Our results in a game environment and a simulated robotic gripper setting underscore the importance of segmentation; randomly sampled segments diminish performance, while incorporating labelled segments from PS improves policy performance to the level of a policy trained on twice the amount of labelled data.</p></details> |  |

Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 20.81% in satisfying traversability constraints and 28.51% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, adjusting specific elements in generated videos, such as object motion or camera movement, is often a tedious process of trial and error, e.g., involving re-generating videos with different random seeds. Recent techniques address this issue by fine-tuning a pre-trained model to follow conditioning signals, such as bounding boxes or point trajectories. Yet, this fine-tuning procedure can be computationally expensive, and it requires datasets with annotated object motion, which can be difficult to procure. In this work, we introduce SG-I2V, a framework for controllable image-to-video generation that is self-guided$\unicode{x2013}$offering zero-shot control by relying solely on the knowledge present in a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model without the need for fine-tuning or external knowledge. Our zero-shot method outperforms unsupervised baselines while significantly narrowing down the performance gap with supervised models in terms of visual quality and motion fidelity.

Exiting efforts focus on single-frame cooperative perception, however, how to capture the temporal cue between frames with V2X to facilitate the prediction task even the planning task is still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Co-MTP, a general cooperative trajectory prediction framework with multi-temporal fusion for autonomous driving, which leverages the V2X system to fully capture the interaction among agents in both history and future domains to benefit the planning. In the history domain, V2X can complement the incomplete history trajectory in single-vehicle perception, and we design a heterogeneous graph transformer to learn the fusion of the history feature from multiple agents and capture the history interaction. Moreover, the goal of prediction is to support future planning. Thus, in the future domain, V2X can provide the prediction results of surrounding objects, and we further extend the graph transformer to capture the future interaction among the ego planning and the other vehicles' intentions and obtain the final future scenario state under a certain planning action. We evaluate the Co-MTP framework on the real-world dataset V2X-Seq, and the results show that Co-MTP achieves state-of-the-art performance and that both history and future fusion can greatly benefit prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, ICRA 2025</p></details> |

| **[Patient Trajectory Prediction: Integrating Clinical Notes with Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18009v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting disease trajectories from electronic health records (EHRs) is a complex task due to major challenges such as data non-stationarity, high granularity of medical codes, and integration of multimodal data. EHRs contain both structured data, such as diagnostic codes, and unstructured data, such as clinical notes, which hold essential information often overlooked. Current models, primarily based on structured data, struggle to capture the complete medical context of patients, resulting in a loss of valuable information. To address this issue, we propose an approach that integrates unstructured clinical notes into transformer-based deep learning models for sequential disease prediction. This integration enriches the representation of patients' medical histories, thereby improving the accuracy of diagnosis predictions. Experiments on MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional models relying solely on structured data.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate inertial drift, end-to-end neural network approaches combined with quadrotor periodic trajectories were suggested. There, the quadrotor distance is regressed and combined with inertial model-based heading estimation, the quadrotor position vector is estimated. To further enhance positioning performance, in this paper we propose a quadrotor neural dead reckoning approach for quadrotors flying on periodic trajectories. In this case, the inertial readings are fed into a simple and efficient network to directly estimate the quadrotor position vector. Our approach was evaluated on two different quadrotors, one operating indoors while the other outdoors. Our approach improves the positioning accuracy of other deep-learning approaches, achieving an average 27% reduction in error outdoors and an average 79% reduction indoors, while requiring only software modifications. With the improved positioning accuracy achieved by our method, the quadrotor can seamlessly perform its tasks.</p></details> |  |

The base transcription algorithm for which we establish the refinement algorithm is a direct multiple shooting technique -- $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ (Quasi-Interpolation based Trajectory Optimization). The mesh refinement technique consists of two steps -- localization of certain irregular regions in an optimal control trajectory via wavelets, followed by a targeted $h$-refinement approach around such regions of irregularity. Theoretical approximation guarantees on uniform grids are presented for optimal controls with certain regularity properties, along with guarantees of localization of change points by wavelet transform. Numerical illustrations are provided for control profiles involving discontinuities to show the effectiveness of the localization and refinement strategy.

| **[Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Trajectory Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15429v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[TraFlow: Trajectory Distillation on Pre-Trained Rectified Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16972v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Majorities of distillation methods on pre-trained diffusion models or on pre-trained rectified flow, focus on either the distillation outputs or the trajectories between random noises and clean images to speed up sample generations from pre-trained models. In those trajectory-based distillation methods, consistency distillation requires the self-consistent trajectory projection to regulate the trajectory, which might avoid the common ODE approximation error {while still be concerning about sampling efficiencies}. At the same time, rectified flow distillations enforce straight trajectory for fast sampling, although an ODE solver is still required. In this work, we propose a trajectory distillation method, \modelname, that enjoys the benefits of both and enables few-step generations. TraFlow adopts the settings of consistency trajectory models, and further enforces the properties of self-consistency and straightness throughout the entire trajectory. These two properties are pursued by reaching a balance with following three targets: (1) reconstruct the output from pre-trained models; (2) learn the amount of changes by pre-trained models; (3) satisfy the self-consistency over its trajectory. Extensive experimental results have shown the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterizing Structured versus Unstructured Environments based on Pedestrians' and Vehicles' Motion Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16847v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory behaviours of pedestrians and vehicles operating close to each other can be different in unstructured compared to structured environments. These differences in the motion behaviour are valuable to be considered in the trajectory prediction algorithm of an autonomous vehicle. However, the available datasets on pedestrians' and vehicles' trajectories that are commonly used as benchmarks for trajectory prediction have not been classified based on the nature of their environment. On the other hand, the definitions provided for unstructured and structured environments are rather qualitative and hard to be used for justifying the type of a given environment. In this paper, we have compared different existing datasets based on a couple of extracted trajectory features, such as mean speed and trajectory variability. Through K-means clustering and generalized linear models, we propose more quantitative measures for distinguishing the two different types of environments. Our results show that features such as trajectory variability, stop fraction and density of pedestrians are different among the two environmental types and can be used to classify the existing datasets.</p></details> |  |

While recent research demonstrates the applicability of diffusion models to OOD detection, existing approaches are limited to Euclidean or latent image spaces. Our work extends OOD detection to trajectories in the Special Euclidean Group in 3D ($\mathbb{SE}(3)$), addressing a critical need in computer vision, robotics, and engineering applications that process object pose sequences in $\mathbb{SE}(3)$. We present $\textbf{D}$iffusion-based $\textbf{O}$ut-of-distribution detection on $\mathbb{SE}(3)$ ($\mathbf{DOSE3}$), a novel OOD framework that extends diffusion to a unified sample space of $\mathbb{SE}(3)$ pose sequences. Through extensive validation on multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate $\mathbf{DOSE3}$'s superior performance compared to state-of-the-art OOD detection frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention-based UAV Trajectory Optimization for Wireless Power Transfer-assisted IoT Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17517v1)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in Wireless Power Transfer (WPT)-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) systems face the following challenges: limited resources and suboptimal trajectory planning. Reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning schemes face issues of low search efficiency and learning instability when optimizing large-scale systems. To address these issues, we present an Attention-based UAV Trajectory Optimization (AUTO) framework based on the graph transformer, which consists of an Attention Trajectory Optimization Model (ATOM) and a Trajectory lEarNing Method based on Actor-critic (TENMA). In ATOM, a graph encoder is used to calculate the self-attention characteristics of all IoTDs, and a trajectory decoder is developed to optimize the number and trajectories of UAVs. TENMA then trains the ATOM using an improved Actor-Critic method, in which the real reward of the system is applied as the baseline to reduce variances in the critic network. This method is suitable for high-quality and large-scale multi-UAV trajectory planning. Finally, we develop numerous experiments, including a hardware experiment in the field case, to verify the feasibility and efficiency of the AUTO framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[UAVDB: Trajectory-Guided Adaptable Bounding Boxes for UAV Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06490v5)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in surveillance, security, and airspace management has created an urgent demand for precise, scalable, and efficient UAV detection. However, existing datasets often suffer from limited scale diversity and inaccurate annotations, hindering robust model development. This paper introduces UAVDB, a high-resolution UAV detection dataset constructed using Patch Intensity Convergence (PIC). This novel technique automatically generates high-fidelity bounding box annotations from UAV trajectory data~\cite{li2020reconstruction}, eliminating the need for manual labeling. UAVDB features single-class annotations with a fixed-camera setup and consists of RGB frames capturing UAVs across various scales, from large-scale UAVs to near-single-pixel representations, along with challenging backgrounds that pose difficulties for modern detectors. We first validate the accuracy and efficiency of PIC-generated bounding boxes by comparing Intersection over Union (IoU) performance and runtime against alternative annotation methods, demonstrating that PIC achieves higher annotation accuracy while being more efficient. Subsequently, we benchmark UAVDB using state-of-the-art (SOTA) YOLO-series detectors, establishing UAVDB as a valuable resource for advancing long-range and high-resolution UAV detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Different from the classical state space model, our series of studies, including this paper, model the collection of the target state as a stochastic process (SP) that is further decomposed into a deterministic part which represents the trend of the trajectory and a residual SP representing the residual fitting error. Subsequently, the tracking problem is formulated as a learning problem regarding the trajectory SP for which a key part is to estimate a trajectory FoT (T-FoT) best fitting the measurements in time series. For this purpose, we consider the polynomial T-FoT and address the regularized polynomial T-FoT optimization employing two distinct regularization strategies seeking trade-off between the accuracy and simplicity. One limits the order of the polynomial and then the best choice is determined by grid searching in a narrow, bounded range while the other adopts $\ell_0$ norm regularization for which the hybrid Newton solver is employed. Simulation results obtained in both single and multiple maneuvering target scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part II of a series of companion papers; 11 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing PPO with Trajectory-Aware Hybrid Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15968v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is one of the most popular state-of-the-art on-policy algorithms that has become a standard baseline in modern reinforcement learning with applications in numerous fields. Though it delivers stable performance with theoretical policy improvement guarantees, high variance, and high sample complexity still remain critical challenges in on-policy algorithms. To alleviate these issues, we propose Hybrid-Policy Proximal Policy Optimization (HP3O), which utilizes a trajectory replay buffer to make efficient use of trajectories generated by recent policies. Particularly, the buffer applies the "first in, first out" (FIFO) strategy so as to keep only the recent trajectories to attenuate the data distribution drift. A batch consisting of the trajectory with the best return and other randomly sampled ones from the buffer is used for updating the policy networks. The strategy helps the agent to improve its capability on top of the most recent best performance and in turn reduce variance empirically. We theoretically construct the policy improvement guarantees for the proposed algorithm. HP3O is validated and compared against several baseline algorithms using multiple continuous control environments. Our code is available here.</p></details> |  |
| **[BP-SGCN: Behavioral Pseudo-Label Informed Sparse Graph Convolution Network for Pedestrian and Heterogeneous Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14676v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction allows better decision-making in applications of autonomous vehicles or surveillance by predicting the short-term future movement of traffic agents. It is classified into pedestrian or heterogeneous trajectory prediction. The former exploits the relatively consistent behavior of pedestrians, but is limited in real-world scenarios with heterogeneous traffic agents such as cyclists and vehicles. The latter typically relies on extra class label information to distinguish the heterogeneous agents, but such labels are costly to annotate and cannot be generalized to represent different behaviors within the same class of agents. In this work, we introduce the behavioral pseudo-labels that effectively capture the behavior distributions of pedestrians and heterogeneous agents solely based on their motion features, significantly improving the accuracy of trajectory prediction. To implement the framework, we propose the Behavioral Pseudo-Label Informed Sparse Graph Convolution Network (BP-SGCN) that learns pseudo-labels and informs to a trajectory predictor. For optimization, we propose a cascaded training scheme, in which we first learn the pseudo-labels in an unsupervised manner, and then perform end-to-end fine-tuning on the labels in the direction of increasing the trajectory prediction accuracy. Experiments show that our pseudo-labels effectively model different behavior clusters and improve trajectory prediction. Our proposed BP-SGCN outperforms existing methods using both pedestrian (ETH/UCY, pedestrian-only SDD) and heterogeneous agent datasets (SDD, Argoverse 1).</p></details> |  |
| **[A View of the Certainty-Equivalence Method for PAC RL as an Application of the Trajectory Tree Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02652v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) enables an agent interacting with an unknown MDP $M$ to optimise its behaviour by observing transitions sampled from $M$. A natural entity that emerges in the agent's reasoning is $\widehat{M}$, the maximum likelihood estimate of $M$ based on the observed transitions. The well-known \textit{certainty-equivalence} method (CEM) dictates that the agent update its behaviour to $\widehat{\pi}$, which is an optimal policy for $\widehat{M}$. Not only is CEM intuitive, it has been shown to enjoy minimax-optimal sample complexity in some regions of the parameter space for PAC RL with a generative model~\citep{Agarwal2020GenModel}. A seemingly unrelated algorithm is the ``trajectory tree method'' (TTM)~\citep{Kearns+MN:1999}, originally developed for efficient decision-time planning in large POMDPs. This paper presents a theoretical investigation that stems from the surprising finding that CEM may indeed be viewed as an application of TTM. The qualitative benefits of this view are (1) new and simple proofs of sample complexity upper bounds for CEM, in fact under a (2) weaker assumption on the rewards than is prevalent in the current literature. Our analysis applies to both non-stationary and stationary MDPs. Quantitatively, we obtain (3) improvements in the sample-complexity upper bounds for CEM both for non-stationary and stationary MDPs, in the regime that the ``mistake probability'' $\delta$ is small. Additionally, we show (4) a lower bound on the sample complexity for finite-horizon MDPs, which establishes the minimax-optimality of our upper bound for non-stationary MDPs in the small-$\delta$ regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, excluding references and appendices.

Recently, two important approaches have gained recognition. While one leverages via-points to adapt skills locally by modulating demonstrated trajectories, another relies on so-called task-parameterized models that encode movements with respect to different coordinate systems, using a product of probabilities for generalization. While the former are well-suited to precise, local modulations, the latter aim at generalizing over large regions of the workspace and often involve multiple objects. Addressing the quality of generalization by leveraging both approaches simultaneously has received little attention. In this work, we propose an interactive imitation learning framework that simultaneously leverages local and global modulations of trajectory distributions. Building on the kernelized movement primitives (KMP) framework, we introduce novel mechanisms for skill modulation from direct human corrective feedback. Our approach particularly exploits the concept of via-points to incrementally and interactively 1) improve the model accuracy locally, 2) add new objects to the task during execution and 3) extend the skill into regions where demonstrations were not provided. We evaluate our method on a bearing ring-loading task using a torque-controlled, 7-DoF, DLR SARA robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), 16 pages, 19 figures, 6 tables.

Giving constraints in natural language form has great potential for practical scenarios due to its flexible transfer capability and accessibility. Previous safe RL methods with natural language constraints typically need to design cost functions manually for each constraint, which requires domain expertise and lacks flexibility. In this paper, we harness the dual role of text in this task, using it not only to provide constraint but also as a training signal. We introduce the Trajectory-level Textual Constraints Translator (TTCT) to replace the manually designed cost function. Our empirical results demonstrate that TTCT effectively comprehends textual constraint and trajectory, and the policies trained by TTCT can achieve a lower violation rate than the standard cost function. Extra studies are conducted to demonstrate that the TTCT has zero-shot transfer capability to adapt to constraint-shift environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

This paper investigates the use of sequential deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformers, for real-time flock detection in multi-pedestrian trajectories. Our proposed approach consists of a two-stage process: first, a pre-trained binary classification model is used for pairwise trajectory classification, and second, the learned representations are applied to identify multi-agent flocks dynamically. We validate our method using real-world group movement datasets, demonstrating its robustness across varying sequence lengths and diverse movement patterns. Experimental results indicate that our model consistently detects pedestrian flocks with high accuracy and stability, even in dynamic and noisy environments. Furthermore, we extend our approach to identify other forms of collective motion, such as convoys and swarms, paving the way for more comprehensive multi-agent behavior analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[DDAT: Diffusion Policies Enforcing Dynamically Admissible Robot Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15043v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at creating images and videos thanks to their multimodal generative capabilities. These same capabilities have made diffusion models increasingly popular in robotics research, where they are used for generating robot motion. However, the stochastic nature of diffusion models is fundamentally at odds with the precise dynamical equations describing the feasible motion of robots. Hence, generating dynamically admissible robot trajectories is a challenge for diffusion models. To alleviate this issue, we introduce DDAT: Diffusion policies for Dynamically Admissible Trajectories to generate provably admissible trajectories of black-box robotic systems using diffusion models. A sequence of states is a dynamically admissible trajectory if each state of the sequence belongs to the reachable set of its predecessor by the robot's equations of motion. To generate such trajectories, our diffusion policies project their predictions onto a dynamically admissible manifold during both training and inference to align the objective of the denoiser neural network with the dynamical admissibility constraint. The auto-regressive nature of these projections along with the black-box nature of robot dynamics render these projections immensely challenging. We thus enforce admissibility by iteratively sampling a polytopic under-approximation of the reachable set of a state onto which we project its predicted successor, before iterating this process with the projected successor. By producing accurate trajectories, this projection eliminates the need for diffusion models to continually replan, enabling one-shot long-horizon trajectory planning. We demonstrate that our framework generates higher quality dynamically admissible robot trajectories through extensive simulations on a quadcopter and various MuJoCo environments, along with real-world experiments on a Unitree GO1 and GO2.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Finding Complex Patterns in Trajectory Data via Geometric Set Cover](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14865v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustering trajectories is a central challenge when faced with large amounts of movement data such as GPS data. We study a clustering problem that can be stated as a geometric set cover problem: Given a polygonal curve of complexity $n$, find the smallest number $k$ of representative trajectories of complexity at most $l$ such that any point on the input trajectories lies on a subtrajectory of the input that has Fr\'echet distance at most $\Delta$ to one of the representative trajectories. In previous work, Br\"uning et al.~(2022) developed a bicriteria approximation algorithm that returns a set of curves of size $O(kl\log(kl))$ which covers the input with a radius of $11\Delta$ in time $\widetilde{O}((kl)^2n + kln^3)$, where $k$ is the smallest number of curves of complexity $l$ needed to cover the input with a radius of $\Delta$. The representative trajectories computed by this algorithm are always line segments. In the applications however, one is usually interested in more complex representative curves which consist of several edges. We present a new approach that builds upon previous work computing a set of curves of size $O(k\log(n))$ in time $\widetilde{O}(l^2n^4 + kln^4)$ with the same distance guarantee of $11\Delta$, where each curve may consist of curves of complexity up to the given complexity parameter~$l$. We conduct experiments on tracking data of ocean currents and full body motion data suggesting its validity as a tool for analyzing large spatio-temporal data sets.</p></details> |  |

Compared with the traditional trajectory composed of a set of point-estimates obtained by a tracker in the measurement time-series, the trajectory that our series of studies including this paper pursued is given by a curve function of time (FoT). The trajectory FoT provides complete information of the movement of the target over time and can be used to infer the state corresponding to arbitrary time, not only at the measurement time. However, there are no metrics available for comparing and evaluating the trajectory FoT. To address this lacuna, we propose a metric denominated as the spatiotemporal-aligned trajectory integral distance (Star-ID). The StarID associates and aligns the estimated and actual trajectories in the spatio-temporal domain and distinguishes between the time-aligned and unaligned segments in calculating the spatial divergence including false alarm, miss-detection and localization errors. The effectiveness of the proposed distance metric and the time-averaged version is validated through theoretical analysis and numerical examples of a single target or multiple targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part I of a series of companion papers; 11 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

In practice, however, MPPI often struggles to guarantee safety assurance and balance efficient sampling in open spaces with the need for more extensive exploration under tight constraints. To address this challenge, we incorporate discrete barrier states (DBaS) into MPPI and propose a novel MPPI-DBaS algorithm that ensures system safety and enables adaptive exploration across diverse scenarios. We evaluate our method in simulation experiments where the vehicle navigates through closely placed obstacles. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms standard MPPI, achieving a higher success rate and lower tracking errors.</p></details> | CCC 2025 |

Existing work primarily focuses on behavior cloning from expert demonstrations and preference learning through exploratory trajectory sampling. However, these methods often struggle in long-horizon tasks, where suboptimal actions accumulate step by step, causing agents to deviate from correct task trajectories. To address this, we highlight the importance of timely calibration and the need to automatically construct calibration trajectories for training agents. We propose Step-Level Trajectory Calibration (STeCa), a novel framework for LLM agent learning. Specifically, STeCa identifies suboptimal actions through a step-level reward comparison during exploration. It constructs calibrated trajectories using LLM-driven reflection, enabling agents to learn from improved decision-making processes. These calibrated trajectories, together with successful trajectory data, are utilized for reinforced training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STeCa significantly outperforms existing methods. Further analysis highlights that step-level calibration enables agents to complete tasks with greater robustness.

In a potential application of the proposed methodology, a ground mobile robot may serve as a mobile charging station and coordinates in real-time with a quadrotor to be charged, facilitating a safe and efficient rendezvous and landing. We verified the generated trajectories in simulation and real-world applications, demonstrating the real-time capabilities of the proposed landing planning framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Map-Matching in Urban Road Networks Based on RSS Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01280v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes an RSS-based approach to reconstruct vehicle trajectories within a road network, enforcing signal propagation rules and vehicle mobility constraints to mitigate the impact of RSS noise and sparsity. The key challenge lies in leveraging latent spatiotemporal correlations within RSS data while navigating complex road networks. To address this, we develop a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based RSS embedding (HRE) technique that employs alternating optimization to infer vehicle trajectories from RSS measurements. This model captures spatiotemporal dependencies while a road graph ensures network compliance. Additionally, we introduce a maximum speed-constrained rough trajectory estimation (MSR) method to guide the optimization process, enabling rapid convergence to a favorable local solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explorer: Scaling Exploration-driven Web Trajectory Synthesis for Multimodal Web Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11357v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent success in large multimodal models (LMMs) has sparked promising applications of agents capable of autonomously completing complex web tasks. While open-source LMM agents have made significant advances in offline evaluation benchmarks, their performance still falls substantially short of human-level capabilities in more realistic online settings. A key bottleneck is the lack of diverse and large-scale trajectory-level datasets across various domains, which are expensive to collect. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a scalable recipe to synthesize the largest and most diverse trajectory-level dataset to date, containing over 94K successful multimodal web trajectories, spanning 49K unique URLs, 720K screenshots, and 33M web elements. In particular, we leverage extensive web exploration and refinement to obtain diverse task intents. The average cost is 28 cents per successful trajectory, making it affordable to a wide range of users in the community. Leveraging this dataset, we train Explorer, a multimodal web agent, and demonstrate strong performance on both offline and online web agent benchmarks such as Mind2Web-Live, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and MiniWob++. Additionally, our experiments highlight data scaling as a key driver for improving web agent capabilities. We hope this study makes state-of-the-art LMM-based agent research at a larger scale more accessible.</p></details> | 24 pages, 7 figures |
| **[BoundPlanner: A convex-set-based approach to bounded manipulator trajectory planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13286v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online trajectory planning enables robot manipulators to react quickly to changing environments or tasks. Many robot trajectory planners exist for known environments but are often too slow for online computations. Current methods in online trajectory planning do not find suitable trajectories in challenging scenarios that respect the limits of the robot and account for collisions. This work proposes a trajectory planning framework consisting of the novel Cartesian path planner based on convex sets, called BoundPlanner, and the online trajectory planner BoundMPC. BoundPlanner explores and maps the collision-free space using convex sets to compute a reference path with bounds. BoundMPC is extended in this work to handle convex sets for path deviations, which allows the robot to optimally follow the path within the bounds while accounting for the robot's kinematics. Collisions of the robot's kinematic chain are considered by a novel convex-set-based collision avoidance formulation independent on the number of obstacles. Simulations and experiments with a 7-DoF manipulator show the performance of the proposed planner compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at github.com/Thieso/BoundPlanner and videos of the experiments can be found at www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/42d4</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Our vehicle simulator efficiently models vehicle motion, generating trajectories that can be supervised to fit real-world data. By leveraging its differentiable nature, IDM parameters are optimized using gradient-based methods. With the capability to simulate up to 2 million vehicles in real time, the system is scalable for large-scale trajectory optimization. We show that we can use the simulator to filter noise in the input trajectories (trajectory filtering), reconstruct dense trajectories from sparse ones (trajectory reconstruction), and predict future trajectories (trajectory prediction), with all generated trajectories adhering to physical laws. We validate our simulator and algorithm on several datasets including NGSIM and Waymo Open Dataset.

To address this challenge, and reduce the risk of disrupting operations, we leverage recent advances in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) to develop a neural state-space model (NSSM) that predicts plasma dynamics during Tokamak \`a Configuration Variable (TCV) rampdowns. By integrating simple physics structure and data-driven models, the NSSM efficiently learns plasma dynamics during the rampdown from a modest dataset of 311 pulses with only five pulses in the reactor relevant high performance regime. The NSSM is parallelized across uncertainties, and reinforcement learning (RL) is applied to design trajectories that avoid multiple instability limits with high probability. Experiments at TCV ramping down high performance plasmas show statistically significant improvements in current and energy at plasma termination, with improvements in speed through continuous re-training. A predict-first experiment, increasing plasma current by 20\% from baseline, demonstrates the NSSM's ability to make small extrapolations with sufficient accuracy to design trajectories that successfully terminate the pulse. The developed approach paves the way for designing tokamak controls with robustness to considerable uncertainty, and demonstrates the relevance of the SciML approach to learning plasma dynamics for rapidly developing robust trajectories and controls during the incremental campaigns of upcoming burning plasma tokamaks.</p></details> |  |

Existing RL-based fine-tuning methods focus on single training timesteps and neglect trajectory-level alignment, while recent sampling trajectory optimization methods incur significant inference NFE costs. Diffusion-Sharpening overcomes this by using a path integral framework to select optimal trajectories during training, leveraging reward feedback, and amortizing inference costs. Our method demonstrates superior training efficiency with faster convergence, and best inference efficiency without requiring additional NFEs. Extensive experiments show that Diffusion-Sharpening outperforms RL-based fine-tuning methods (e.g., Diffusion-DPO) and sampling trajectory optimization methods (e.g., Inference Scaling) across diverse metrics including text alignment, compositional capabilities, and human preferences, offering a scalable and efficient solution for future diffusion model fine-tuning.

| **[Leader and Follower: Interactive Motion Generation under Trajectory Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11563v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of game and film production, generating interactive motion from texts has garnered significant attention due to its potential to revolutionize content creation processes. In many practical applications, there is a need to impose strict constraints on the motion range or trajectory of virtual characters. However, existing methods that rely solely on textual input face substantial challenges in accurately capturing the user's intent, particularly in specifying the desired trajectory. As a result, the generated motions often lack plausibility and accuracy. Moreover, existing trajectory - based methods for customized motion generation rely on retraining for single - actor scenarios, which limits flexibility and adaptability to different datasets, as well as interactivity in two-actor motions. To generate interactive motion following specified trajectories, this paper decouples complex motion into a Leader - Follower dynamic, inspired by role allocation in partner dancing. Based on this framework, this paper explores the motion range refinement process in interactive motion generation and proposes a training-free approach, integrating a Pace Controller and a Kinematic Synchronization Adapter. The framework enhances the ability of existing models to generate motion that adheres to trajectory by controlling the leader's movement and correcting the follower's motion to align with the leader. Experimental results show that the proposed approach, by better leveraging trajectory information, outperforms existing methods in both realism and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[A linear-time algorithm computing the resident fitness in interacting trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11561v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The notion of a system of interacting trajectories was recently introduced by Hermann, Gonz\'alez Casanova, Soares dos Santos, T\'obi\'as and Wakolbinger. Such a system of $[0,1]$-valued piecewise linear trajectories arises as a scaling limit of the system of logarithmic subpopulation sizes in a certain population-genetic model (more precisely, a Moran model) with mutation and selection. By definition, the resident fitness is initially 0 and afterwards it increases by the ultimate slope of each trajectory that reaches height 1. We show that although the interaction of $n$ trajectories may yield $\Omega(n^2)$ slope changes in total, the resident fitness (at all times) can be computed algorithmically in $O(n)$ time. Our algorithm is given in terms of the so-called continued lines representation of the system of interacting trajectories. In the special case of Poissonian interacting trajectories where the birth times of the trajectories form a Poisson process and the initial slopes are random and i.i.d., we show that even the expected number of slope changes grows only linearly in time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing Computational Complexity of Rigidity-Based UAV Trajectory Optimization for Real-Time Cooperative Target Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11278v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and swift localization of the target is crucial in emergencies. However, accurate position data of a target mobile device, typically obtained from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), cellular networks, or WiFi, may not always be accessible to first responders. For instance, 1) accuracy and availability can be limited in challenging signal reception environments, and 2) in regions where emergency location services are not mandatory, certain mobile devices may not transmit their location during emergencies. As an alternative localization method, a network of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be employed to passively locate targets by collecting radio frequency (RF) signal measurements, such as received signal strength (RSS). In these situations, UAV trajectories play a critical role in localization performance, influencing both accuracy and search time. Previous studies optimized UAV trajectories using the determinant of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), but its performance declines under unfavorable geometric conditions, such as when UAVs start from a single base, leading to position ambiguity. To address this, our prior work introduced a rigidity-based approach, which improved the search time compared to FIM-based methods in our simulation case. However, the high computational cost of rigidity-based optimization, primarily due to singular value decomposition (SVD), limits its practicality. In this paper, we applied techniques to reduce computational complexity, including randomized SVD, smooth SVD, and vertex pruning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ION ITM 2025</p></details> |

Past research relied on incorporating deterministic future states of surrounding pedestrians which can be overconfident leading to unsafe robot behaviour. The current paper proposes a predictive uncertainty-aware planner that integrates neural network based probabilistic trajectory prediction into planning. Our method uses a deep ensemble based network for probabilistic forecasting of surrounding humans and integrates the predictive uncertainty as constraints into the planner. We compare numerous constraint satisfaction methods on the planner and evaluated its performance on real world pedestrian datasets. Further, offline robot navigation was carried out on out-of-distribution pedestrian trajectories inside a narrow corridor</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy for Long-horizon Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10040v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have advanced robot imitation learning, but high data collection costs and limited demonstrations hinder generalization and current imitation learning methods struggle in out-of-distribution scenarios, especially for long-horizon tasks. A key challenge is how to mitigate compounding errors in imitation learning, which lead to cascading failures over extended trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose the Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy (DTP) framework, which generates 2D trajectories through a diffusion model to guide policy learning for long-horizon tasks. By leveraging task-relevant trajectories, DTP provides trajectory-level guidance to reduce error accumulation. Our two-stage approach first trains a generative vision-language model to create diffusion-based trajectories, then refines the imitation policy using them. Experiments on the CALVIN benchmark show that DTP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25% in success rate, starting from scratch without external pretraining. Moreover, DTP significantly improves real-world robot performance.</p></details> |  |

Without loosing any information, we associate to each state a binary random function, taking values in $\{0,1\}$, and turn the problem of statistical modeling of a categorical process into a multivariate functional data analysis issue. The (multivariate) covariance operator has nice interpretations in terms of departure from independence of the joint probabilities and the multivariate functional principal components are simple to interpret. Under the weak hypothesis assuming only continuity in probability of the $0-1$ trajectories, it is simple to build consistent estimators of the covariance kernel and perform multivariate functional principal components analysis. The sample paths being piecewise constant, with a finite number of jumps, this a rare case in functional data analysis in which the trajectories can be observed exhaustively. The approach is illustrated on a data set of sensory perceptions, considering different gustometer-controlled stimuli experiments. We show how it can be easily extended to analyze experiments, such as temporal check-all-that-apply, in which two states or more can be observed at the same time.</p></details> |  |

We frame this problem as an instance of abduction guided by a novel parsimony function represented as an aggregate truth value over an annotated logic program. This approach has the added benefit of affording explainability to an analyst user. By showing that any subset of such a program can provide a lower bound on this parsimony requirement, we are able to abduce movement trajectories efficiently through an informed (i.e., A*) search. We describe how our implementation was enhanced with the application of multiple techniques in order to be scaled and integrated with a cloud-based software stack that included bottom-up rule learning, geolocated knowledge graph retrieval/management, and interfaces with government systems for independently conducted government-run tests for which we provide results. We also report on our own experiments showing that we not only provide exact results but also scale to very large scenarios and provide realistic agent trajectories that can go undetected by machine learning anomaly detectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICLP 2024, arXiv:2502.08453</p></details> |

Our analysis demonstrates that poor quality input leads to noisy and unreliable predictions, which can be detrimental to navigation modules. We evaluate both input data quality and model output to illustrate the impact of input noise. Furthermore, we show that our estimation system enables effective training of trajectory prediction models even with limited data, producing robust predictions across different environments. Accurate estimations are crucial for deploying trajectory prediction models in real-world scenarios, and our system ensures meaningful and reliable results across various application contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, IEEE INTELLIGENT VEHICLES SYMPOSIUM (IV 2025)</p></details> |

However, due to the highly dynamic and multimodal nature of the task, accurately predicting the future trajectory of a target vehicle remains a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose an Ego vehicle Planning-informed Network (EPN) for multimodal trajectory prediction. In real-world driving, the future trajectory of a vehicle is influenced not only by its own historical trajectory, but also by the behavior of other vehicles. So, we incorporate the future planned trajectory of the ego vehicle as an additional input to simulate the mutual influence between vehicles. Furthermore, to tackle the challenges of intention ambiguity and large prediction errors often encountered in methods based on driving intentions, we propose an endpoint prediction module for the target vehicle. This module predicts the target vehicle endpoints, refines them using a correction mechanism, and generates a multimodal predicted trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that EPN achieves an average reduction of 34.9%, 30.7%, and 30.4% in RMSE, ADE, and FDE on the NGSIM dataset, and an average reduction of 64.6%, 64.5%, and 64.3% in RMSE, ADE, and FDE on the HighD dataset.

One-step diffusion models generate high-quality images in a one sampling step, greatly reducing computational overhead and inference latency. However, most existing one-step diffusion methods are constrained by the performance of the teacher model, where poor teacher performance results in image artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose FluxSR, a novel one-step diffusion Real-ISR technique based on flow matching models. We use the state-of-the-art diffusion model FLUX.1-dev as both the teacher model and the base model. First, we introduce Flow Trajectory Distillation (FTD) to distill a multi-step flow matching model into a one-step Real-ISR. Second, to improve image realism and address high-frequency artifact issues in generated images, we propose TV-LPIPS as a perceptual loss and introduce Attention Diversification Loss (ADL) as a regularization term to reduce token similarity in transformer, thereby eliminating high-frequency artifacts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing one-step diffusion-based Real-ISR methods.

Cycling data has especially been the focus of data collection endeavors in recent years. Although privacy risks regarding location data are widely known, practitioners often refrain from advanced privacy mechanisms to prevent utility losses. Removing user identifiers from trips is thereby deemed a major privacy gain, as it supposedly prevents linking single trips to obtain entire movement patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel attack to reconstruct user identifiers in GPS trip datasets consisting of single trips, unlike previous ones that are dedicated to evaluating trajectory-user linking in the context of check-in data. We evaluate the remaining privacy risk for users in such datasets and our empirical findings from two real-world datasets show that the risk of re-identification is significant even when personal identifiers have been removed, and that truncation as a simple additional privacy mechanism may not be effective in protecting user privacy. Further investigations indicate that users who frequently visit locations that are only visited by a small number of others, tend to be more vulnerable to re-identification.</p></details> | 32 pages, 15 figures |

Existing methods, however, often obscure critical local hotspots by only considering the start and end positions of objects' trajectories. To address this gap, we propose RouteFlow, a trajectory-aware animated transition method that effectively balances the global trend and local hotspots while minimizing occlusion. RouteFlow is inspired by a real-world bus route analogy: objects are regarded as passengers traveling together, with local hotspots representing bus stops where these passengers get on and off. Based on this analogy, animation paths are generated like bus routes, with the object layout generated similarly to seat allocation according to their destinations. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, RouteFlow better facilitates identifying the global trend and locating local hotspots while performing comparably in tracking objects' movements.</p></details> | Accepted to CHI 2025 |

As the backbone of next-generation solutions, these robots face a critical challenge: managing and minimizing the swept volume during turns while maintaining precise control. Traditional systems designed for standard vehicles often struggle with the complex dynamics of multi-axle configurations, leading to inefficiency and increased safety risk in confined spaces. Our innovative framework overcomes these limitations by combining swept volume minimization with Signed Distance Field (SDF) path planning and model predictive control (MPC) for independent wheel steering. This approach not only plans paths with an awareness of the swept volume but actively minimizes it in real-time, allowing each axle to follow a precise trajectory while significantly reducing the space the vehicle occupies. By predicting future states and adjusting the turning radius of each wheel, our method enhances both maneuverability and safety, even in the most constrained environments. Unlike previous works, our solution goes beyond basic path calculation and tracking, offering real-time path optimization with minimal swept volume and efficient individual axle control. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive approach to tackle these challenges, delivering life-saving improvements in control, efficiency, and safety for multi-axle AMRs. Furthermore, we will open-source our work to foster collaboration and enable others to advance safer, more efficient autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Despite significant advancements in this field, existing studies primarily neglect the high-order inter-trajectory relationships, which represent complex associations among multiple trajectories, manifested through multi-location co-occurrence patterns emerging when trajectories intersect at various Points of Interest (POIs). Furthermore, they also overlook the variable influence of POIs on different trajectories, as well as the user class imbalance problem caused by disparities in user activity levels and check-in frequencies. To address these limitations, we propose a novel HyperGraph-based multi-perspective Trajectory User Linking model (HGTUL). Our model learns trajectory representations from both relational and spatio-temporal perspectives: (1) it captures high-order associations among trajectories by constructing a trajectory hypergraph and leverages a hypergraph attention network to learn the variable impact of POIs on trajectories; (2) it models the spatio-temporal characteristics of trajectories by incorporating their temporal and spatial information into a sequential encoder. Moreover, we design a data balancing method to effectively address the user class imbalance problem and experimentally validate its significance in TUL. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HGTUL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improvements of 2.57%~20.09% and 5.68%~26.00% in ACC@1 and Macro-F1 metrics, respectively.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

However, issues such as device malfunctions and network instability often cause sparse trajectories, leading to lost detailed movement information. Recovering the missing points in sparse trajectories to restore the detailed information is thus essential. Despite recent progress, several challenges remain. First, the lack of large-scale dense trajectory data makes it difficult to train a trajectory recovery model from scratch. Second, the varying spatiotemporal correlations in sparse trajectories make it hard to generalize recovery across different sampling intervals. Third, the lack of location information complicates the extraction of road conditions for missing points. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory recovery model called PLMTrajRec. It leverages the scalability of a pre-trained language model (PLM) and can be fine-tuned with only a limited set of dense trajectories. To handle different sampling intervals in sparse trajectories, we first convert each trajectory's sampling interval and movement features into natural language representations, allowing the PLM to recognize its interval. We then introduce a trajectory encoder to unify trajectories of varying intervals into a single interval and capture their spatiotemporal relationships. To obtain road conditions for missing points, we propose an area flow-guided implicit trajectory prompt, which models road conditions by collecting traffic flows in each region. We also introduce a road condition passing mechanism that uses observed points' road conditions to infer those of the missing points. Experiments on two public trajectory datasets with three sampling intervals each demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability, and generalization ability of PLMTrajRec.</p></details> |  |

However, existing trajectory generation methods often focus on improving trajectory generation quality from a singular perspective, lacking a comprehensive semantic understanding across various scales. Consequently, we are inspired to develop a HOlistic SEmantic Representation (HOSER) framework for navigational trajectory generation. Given an origin-and-destination (OD) pair and the starting time point of a latent trajectory, we first propose a Road Network Encoder to expand the receptive field of road- and zone-level semantics. Second, we design a Multi-Granularity Trajectory Encoder to integrate the spatio-temporal semantics of the generated trajectory at both the point and trajectory levels. Finally, we employ a Destination-Oriented Navigator to seamlessly integrate destination-oriented guidance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HOSER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin. Moreover, the model's performance in few-shot learning and zero-shot learning scenarios further verifies the effectiveness of our holistic semantic representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

A diverse set of methods (e.g., rule-based or learned with different architectures and datasets) have been proposed, yet it is often the case that the performance of these methods is sensitive to the deployment environment (e.g., how well the design rules model the environment, or how accurately the test data match the training data). Building upon the principled theory of online convex optimization but also going beyond convexity and stationarity, we present a lightweight and model-agnostic method to aggregate different trajectory predictors online. We propose treating each individual trajectory predictor as an "expert" and maintaining a probability vector to mix the outputs of different experts. Then, the key technical approach lies in leveraging online data -- the true agent behavior to be revealed at the next timestep -- to form a convex-or-nonconvex, stationary-or-dynamic loss function whose gradient steers the probability vector towards choosing the best mixture of experts. We instantiate this method to aggregate trajectory predictors trained on different cities in the NUSCENES dataset and show that it performs just as well, if not better than, any singular model, even when deployed on the out-of-distribution LYFT dataset.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

We propose HIS_GCNs, a hierarchical importance graph sampling based learning method. By constructing minibatches using sampled subgraphs, HIS_GCNs gives attention to the importance of both core and periphery nodes/edges in a scale-free training graph. Specifically, it preserves the centrum of the core to most minibatches, which maintains connectivity between periphery nodes, and samples periphery edges without core node interference, in order to keep more long chains composed entirely of low-degree nodes in the same minibatch. HIS_GCNs can maximize the discrete Ricci curvature (i.e., Ollivier-Ricci curvatures) of the edges in a subgraph that enables the preservation of important chains for information propagation, and can achieve a low node embedding variance and a high convergence speed. Diverse experiments on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with node classification tasks confirm superior performance of HIS_GCNs in both accuracy and training time.</p></details> | 26 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Safe Distributed Control of Multi-Robot Systems with Communication Delays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09382v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe operation of multi-robot systems is critical, especially in communication-degraded environments such as underwater for seabed mapping, underground caves for navigation, and in extraterrestrial missions for assembly and construction. We address safety of networked autonomous systems where the information exchanged between robots incurs communication delays. We formalize a notion of distributed control barrier function for multi-robot systems, a safety certificate amenable to a distributed implementation, which provides formal ground to using graph neural networks to learn safe distributed controllers. Further, we observe that learning a distributed controller ignoring delays can severely degrade safety. We finally propose a predictor-based framework to train a safe distributed controller under communication delays, where the current state of nearby robots is predicted from received data and age-of-information. Numerical experiments on multi-robot collision avoidance show that our predictor-based approach can significantly improve the safety of a learned distributed controller under communication delays.

Recent approaches introduce weight sharing across tailored architectures, generating unique GNN architectures for each graph end-to-end. However, existing GraphNAS methods do not account for distribution patterns across different graphs and heavily rely on extensive training data. With sparse or single training graphs, these methods struggle to discover optimal mappings between graphs and architectures, failing to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this paper, we propose node-specific graph neural architecture search(NodeNAS), which aims to tailor distinct aggregation methods for different nodes through disentangling node topology and graph distribution with limited datasets. We further propose adaptive aggregation attention based multi-dim NodeNAS method(MNNAS), which learns an node-specific architecture customizer with good generalizability. Specifically, we extend the vertical depth of the search space, supporting simultaneous node-specific architecture customization across multiple dimensions. Moreover, we model the power-law distribution of node degrees under varying assortativity, encoding structure invariant information to guide architecture customization across each dimension. Extensive experiments across supervised and unsupervised tasks demonstrate that MNNAS surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms and achieves excellent OOD generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by DASFAA2025</p></details> |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for Fast Contingency Analysis of Power Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04213v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The successful integration of machine learning models into decision support tools for grid operation hinges on effectively capturing the topological changes in daily operations. Frequent grid reconfigurations and N-k security analyses have to be conducted to ensure a reliable and secure power grid, leading to a vast combinatorial space of possible topologies and operating states. This combinatorial complexity, which increases with grid size, poses a significant computational challenge for traditional solvers. In this paper, we combine Physics-Informed Neural Networks with graph-aware neural network architectures, i.e., a Guided-Dropout (GD) and an Edge-Varying Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture to learn the set points for a grid that considers all probable single-line reconfigurations (all critical N-1 scenarios) and subsequently apply the trained models to N-k scenarios. We demonstrate how incorporating the underlying physical equations for the network equations within the training procedure of the GD and the GNN architectures performs with N-1, N-2, and N-3 case studies. Using the AC Power Flow as a guiding application, we test our methods on the 6-bus, 24-bus, 57-bus, and 118-bus systems. We find that GNN not only achieves the task of contingency screening with satisfactory accuracy but does this up to 400 times faster than the Newton-Raphson power flow solver. Moreover, our results provide a comparison of the GD and GNN models in terms of accuracy and computational speed and provide recommendations on their adoption for contingency analysis of power systems.</p></details> |  |

Mesh data can provide an intuitive and practical expression of rich 3D information. However, its disordered, irregular data structure and complex surface information make it challenging to apply with deep learning models directly. Traditional mesh data processing methods often rely on mesh models with many limitations, such as manifold, which restrict their application scopes in reality and do not fully utilize the advantages of mesh models. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end framework for addressing the challenges associated with deep learning in mesh models centered around graph neural networks (GNN) and is titled InfoGNN. InfoGNN treats the mesh model as a graph, which enables it to handle irregular mesh data efficiently. Moreover, we propose InfoConv and InfoMP modules, which utilize the position information of the points and fully use the static information such as face normals, dihedral angles, and dynamic global feature information to fully use all kinds of data. In addition, InfoGNN is an end-to-end framework, and we simplify the network design to make it more efficient, paving the way for efficient deep learning of complex 3D models. We conducted experiments on several publicly available datasets, and the results show that InfoGNN achieves excellent performance in mesh classification and segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  |

The available benchmark datasets are citation, co-occurrence, e-commerce networks, etc, with classes ranging from 3 to 15. However, there is no benchmark classification social network dataset for graph machine learning. This paper fills the gap and presents the Binary Classification Social Network Dataset (\textit{BiSND}), designed for graph machine learning applications to predict binary classes. We present the BiSND in \textit{tabular and graph} formats to verify its robustness across classical and advanced machine learning. We employ a diverse set of classifiers, including four traditional machine learning algorithms (Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbour, Random Forest, XGBoost), one Deep Neural Network (multi-layer perceptrons), one Graph Neural Network (Graph Convolutional Network), and three state-of-the-art Graph Contrastive Learning methods (BGRL, GRACE, DAENS). Our findings reveal that BiSND is suitable for classification tasks, with F1-scores ranging from 67.66 to 70.15, indicating promising avenues for future enhancements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incorporating graph neural network into route choice model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02315v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Route choice models are one of the most important foundations for transportation research. Traditionally, theory-based models have been utilized for their great interpretability, such as logit models and Recursive logit models. More recently, machine learning approaches have gained attentions for their better prediction accuracy. In this study, we propose novel hybrid models that integrate the Recursive logit model with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance both predictive performance and model interpretability. To the authors' knowldedge, GNNs have not been utilized for route choice modeling, despite their proven effectiveness in capturing road network features and their widespread use in other transportation research areas. We mathematically show that our use of GNN is not only beneficial for enhancing the prediction performance, but also relaxing the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives property without relying on strong assumptions. This is due to the fact that a specific type of GNN can efficiently capture multiple cross-effect patterns on networks from data. By applying the proposed models to one-day travel trajectory data in Tokyo, we confirmed their higher prediction accuracy compared to the existing models.</p></details> |  |
| **[CrystalFramer: Rethinking the Role of Frames for SE(3)-Invariant Crystal Structure Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02209v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crystal structure modeling with graph neural networks is essential for various applications in materials informatics, and capturing SE(3)-invariant geometric features is a fundamental requirement for these networks. A straightforward approach is to model with orientation-standardized structures through structure-aligned coordinate systems, or"frames." However, unlike molecules, determining frames for crystal structures is challenging due to their infinite and highly symmetric nature. In particular, existing methods rely on a statically fixed frame for each structure, determined solely by its structural information, regardless of the task under consideration. Here, we rethink the role of frames, questioning whether such simplistic alignment with the structure is sufficient, and propose the concept of dynamic frames. While accommodating the infinite and symmetric nature of crystals, these frames provide each atom with a dynamic view of its local environment, focusing on actively interacting atoms. We demonstrate this concept by utilizing the attention mechanism in a recent transformer-based crystal encoder, resulting in a new architecture called CrystalFramer. Extensive experiments show that CrystalFramer outperforms conventional frames and existing crystal encoders in various crystal property prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 ma...</summary><p>12 main pages, 3 main figures, and 4 main tables.

| **[Meta Flow Matching: Integrating Vector Fields on the Wasserstein Manifold](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14608v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous biological and physical processes can be modeled as systems of interacting entities evolving continuously over time, e.g. the dynamics of communicating cells or physical particles. Learning the dynamics of such systems is essential for predicting the temporal evolution of populations across novel samples and unseen environments. Flow-based models allow for learning these dynamics at the population level - they model the evolution of the entire distribution of samples. However, current flow-based models are limited to a single initial population and a set of predefined conditions which describe different dynamics. We argue that multiple processes in natural sciences have to be represented as vector fields on the Wasserstein manifold of probability densities. That is, the change of the population at any moment in time depends on the population itself due to the interactions between samples. In particular, this is crucial for personalized medicine where the development of diseases and their respective treatment response depend on the microenvironment of cells specific to each patient. We propose Meta Flow Matching (MFM), a practical approach to integrate along these vector fields on the Wasserstein manifold by amortizing the flow model over the initial populations. Namely, we embed the population of samples using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) and use these embeddings to train a Flow Matching model. This gives MFM the ability to generalize over the initial distributions, unlike previously proposed methods. We demonstrate the ability of MFM to improve the prediction of individual treatment responses on a large-scale multi-patient single-cell drug screen dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Central to the success of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism, which scores the similarity between query and key matrices to modulate a value matrix. This operation bears striking similarities to digraph convolution, prompting an investigation into whether digraph convolution could serve as an alternative to self-attention. In this study, we formalize this concept by introducing a synthetic unitary digraph convolution based on the digraph Fourier transform. The resulting model, which we term Converter, effectively converts a Transformer into a Directed Graph Neural Network (DGNN) form. We have tested Converter on Long-Range Arena benchmark, long document classification, and DNA sequence-based taxonomy classification. Our experimental results demonstrate that Converter achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency and architectural simplicity, which establishes it as a lightweight yet powerful Transformer variant.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 3 figures, and 8 tables; pseudocode improved</p></details> |

However, recent studies have raised concerns about fairness and privacy issues in GNNs, highlighting the potential for biased or discriminatory outcomes and the vulnerability of sensitive information. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of fairness and privacy in GNNs, exploring the impact of various fairness-preserving measures on model performance. We conduct experiments across diverse datasets and evaluate the effectiveness of different fairness interventions. Our analysis considers the trade-offs between fairness, privacy, and accuracy, providing insights into the challenges and opportunities in achieving both fair and private graph learning. The results highlight the importance of carefully selecting and combining fairness-preserving measures based on the specific characteristics of the data and the desired fairness objectives. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between fairness, privacy, and accuracy in GNNs, paving the way for the development of more robust and ethical graph learning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coordinated Multi-Robot Navigation with Formation Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01618v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinated multi-robot navigation is an essential ability for a team of robots operating in diverse environments. Robot teams often need to maintain specific formations, such as wedge formations, to enhance visibility, positioning, and efficiency during fast movement. However, complex environments such as narrow corridors challenge rigid team formations, which makes effective formation control difficult in real-world environments. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Adaptive Formation with Oscillation Reduction (AFOR) approach to improve coordinated multi-robot navigation. We develop AFOR under the theoretical framework of hierarchical learning and integrate a spring-damper model with hierarchical learning to enable both team coordination and individual robot control. At the upper level, a graph neural network facilitates formation adaptation and information sharing among the robots. At the lower level, reinforcement learning enables each robot to navigate and avoid obstacles while maintaining the formations. We conducted extensive experiments using Gazebo in the Robot Operating System (ROS), a high-fidelity Unity3D simulator with ROS, and real robot teams. Results demonstrate that AFOR enables smooth navigation with formation adaptation in complex scenarios and outperforms previous methods.

| **[Quantifying Point Contributions: A Lightweight Framework for Efficient and Effective Query-Driven Trajectory Simplification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02047v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large volumes of trajectory data accumulate, simplifying trajectories to reduce storage and querying costs is increasingly studied. Existing proposals face three main problems. First, they require numerous iterations to decide which GPS points to delete. Second, they focus only on the relationships between neighboring points (local information) while neglecting the overall structure (global information), reducing the global similarity between the simplified and original trajectories and making it difficult to maintain consistency in query results, especially for similarity-based queries. Finally, they fail to differentiate the importance of points with similar features, leading to suboptimal selection of points to retain the original trajectory information. We propose MLSimp, a novel Mutual Learning query-driven trajectory simplification framework that integrates two distinct models: GNN-TS, based on graph neural networks, and Diff-TS, based on diffusion models. GNN-TS evaluates the importance of a point according to its globality, capturing its correlation with the entire trajectory, and its uniqueness, capturing its differences from neighboring points. It also incorporates attention mechanisms in the GNN layers, enabling simultaneous data integration from all points within the same trajectory and refining representations, thus avoiding iterative processes. Diff-TS generates amplified signals to enable the retention of the most important points at low compression rates. Experiments involving eight baselines on three databases show that MLSimp reduces the simplification time by 42%--70% and improves query accuracy over simplified trajectories by up to 34.6%.</p></details> | Accepted by VLDB2025 |
| **[Learning Exposure Mapping Functions for Inferring Heterogeneous Peer Effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01722v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In causal inference, interference refers to the phenomenon in which the actions of peers in a network can influence an individual's outcome. Peer effect refers to the difference in counterfactual outcomes of an individual for different levels of peer exposure, the extent to which an individual is exposed to the treatments, actions, or behaviors of peers. Estimating peer effects requires deciding how to represent peer exposure. Typically, researchers define an exposure mapping function that aggregates peer treatments and outputs peer exposure. Most existing approaches for defining exposure mapping functions assume peer exposure based on the number or fraction of treated peers. Recent studies have investigated more complex functions of peer exposure which capture that different peers can exert different degrees of influence. However, none of these works have explicitly considered the problem of automatically learning the exposure mapping function. In this work, we focus on learning this function for the purpose of estimating heterogeneous peer effects, where heterogeneity refers to the variation in counterfactual outcomes for the same peer exposure but different individual's contexts. We develop EgoNetGNN, a graph neural network (GNN)-based method, to automatically learn the appropriate exposure mapping function allowing for complex peer influence mechanisms that, in addition to peer treatments, can involve the local neighborhood structure and edge attributes. We show that GNN models that use peer exposure based on the number or fraction of treated peers or learn peer exposure naively face difficulty accounting for such influence mechanisms. Our comprehensive evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network data shows that our method is more robust to different unknown underlying influence mechanisms when estimating heterogeneous peer effects when compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Ails Generative Structure-based Drug Design: Expressivity is Too Little or Too Much?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06050v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several generative models with elaborate training and sampling procedures have been proposed to accelerate structure-based drug design (SBDD); however, their empirical performance turns out to be suboptimal. We seek to better understand this phenomenon from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Since most of these models apply graph neural networks (GNNs), one may suspect that they inherit the representational limitations of GNNs. We analyze this aspect, establishing the first such results for protein-ligand complexes. A plausible counterview may attribute the underperformance of these models to their excessive parameterizations, inducing expressivity at the expense of generalization. We investigate this possibility with a simple metric-aware approach that learns an economical surrogate for affinity to infer an unlabelled molecular graph and optimizes for labels conditioned on this graph and molecular properties. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art results using 100x fewer trainable parameters and affords up to 1000x speedup. Collectively, our findings underscore the need to reassess and redirect the existing paradigm and efforts for SBDD.

| **[GRNFormer: A Biologically-Guided Framework for Integrating Gene Regulatory Networks into RNA Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01682v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have shown promising capabilities in capturing gene expression patterns. However, current approaches face critical limitations: they ignore biological prior knowledge encoded in gene regulatory relationships and fail to leverage multi-omics signals that could provide complementary regulatory insights. In this paper, we propose GRNFormer, a new framework that systematically integrates multi-scale Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) inferred from multi-omics data into RNA foundation model training. Our framework introduces two key innovations. First, we introduce a pipeline for constructing hierarchical GRNs that capture regulatory relationships at both cell-type-specific and cell-specific resolutions. Second, we design a structure-aware integration framework that addresses the information asymmetry in GRNs through two technical advances: (1) A graph topological adapter using multi-head cross-attention to weight regulatory relationships dynamically, and (2) a novel edge perturbation strategy that perturb GRNs with biologically-informed co-expression links to augment graph neural network training. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on three representative downstream tasks across multiple model architectures to demonstrate the effectiveness of GRNFormer. It achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art (SoTA) baselines: $3.6\%$ increase in drug response prediction correlation, $9.6\%$ improvement in single-cell drug classification AUC, and $1.1\%$ average gain in gene perturbation prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, their open nature also makes them vulnerable to exploitation by malicious actors, including state-sponsored entities, who can conduct information operations (IOs) to manipulate public opinion. The spread of misinformation, false news, and misleading claims threatens democratic processes and societal cohesion, making it crucial to develop methods for the timely detection of inauthentic activity to protect the integrity of online discourse. In this work, we introduce a methodology designed to identify users orchestrating information operations, a.k.a. IO drivers, across various influence campaigns. Our framework, named IOHunter, leverages the combined strengths of Language Models and Graph Neural Networks to improve generalization in supervised, scarcely-supervised, and cross-IO contexts. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple sets of IOs originating from six countries, significantly surpassing existing approaches.

Fraudsters often disguise their crimes, such as using legitimate transactions through several benign users to bypass anti-fraud detection. Existing graph neural network (GNN) models struggle with learning features of camouflaged, indirect multi-hop transactions due to their inherent over-smoothing issues in deep multi-layer aggregation, presenting a major challenge in detecting disguised relationships. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel High-order Graph Representation Learning model (HOGRL) to avoid incorporating excessive noise during the multi-layer aggregation process. In particular, HOGRL learns different orders of \emph{pure} representations directly from high-order transaction graphs. We realize this goal by effectively constructing high-order transaction graphs first and then learning the \emph{pure} representations of each order so that the model could identify fraudsters' multi-hop indirect transactions via multi-layer \emph{pure} feature learning. In addition, we introduce a mixture-of-expert attention mechanism to automatically determine the importance of different orders for jointly optimizing fraud detection performance. We conduct extensive experiments in both the open source and real-world datasets, the result demonstrates the significant improvements of our proposed HOGRL compared with state-of-the-art fraud detection baselines. HOGRL's superior performance also proves its effectiveness in addressing high-order fraud camouflage criminals.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, accepted at IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

However, existing methods often struggle with trading off multiple properties due to the conflicting or correlated nature of chemical properties. To tackle this issue, we introduce InversionGNN framework, an effective yet sample-efficient dual-path graph neural network (GNN) for multi-objective drug discovery. In the direct prediction path of InversionGNN, we train the model for multi-property prediction to acquire knowledge of the optimal combination of functional groups. Then the learned chemical knowledge helps the inversion generation path to generate molecules with required properties. In order to decode the complex knowledge of multiple properties in the inversion path, we propose a gradient-based Pareto search method to balance conflicting properties and generate Pareto optimal molecules. Additionally, InversionGNN is able to search the full Pareto front approximately in discrete chemical space. Comprehensive experimental evaluations show that InversionGNN is both effective and sample-efficient in various discrete multi-objective settings including drug discovery.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Existing methods typically require centralized data collection, which poses significant privacy and communication challenges. In this work, we introduce a novel Federated Temporal Graph Clustering (FTGC) framework that enables decentralized training of graph neural networks (GNNs) across multiple clients, ensuring data privacy throughout the process. Our approach incorporates a temporal aggregation mechanism to effectively capture the evolution of graph structures over time and a federated optimization strategy to collaboratively learn high-quality clustering representations. By preserving data privacy and reducing communication overhead, our framework achieves competitive performance on temporal graph datasets, making it a promising solution for privacy-sensitive, real-world applications involving dynamic data.</p></details> | 8 pages, 1 figure |

While these platforms facilitate rapid communication, they also accelerate the spread of rumors and extremist speech, impacting public perception and behavior significantly. This issue is particularly pronounced during election periods, where the influence of social media on election outcomes has become a matter of global concern. With the unprecedented number of elections in 2024, against this backdrop, the election ecosystem has encountered unprecedented challenges. This study addresses the urgent need for effective rumor detection on social media by proposing a novel method that combines semantic analysis with graph neural networks. We have meticulously collected a dataset from PolitiFact and Twitter, focusing on politically relevant rumors. Our approach involves semantic analysis using a fine-tuned BERT model to vectorize text content and construct a directed graph where tweets and comments are nodes, and interactions are edges. The core of our method is a graph neural network, SAGEWithEdgeAttention, which extends the GraphSAGE model by incorporating first-order differences as edge attributes and applying an attention mechanism to enhance feature aggregation. This innovative approach allows for the fine-grained analysis of the complex social network structure, improving rumor detection accuracy. The study concludes that our method significantly outperforms traditional content analysis and time-based models, offering a theoretically sound and practically efficient solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Statistical physics analysis of graph neural networks: Approaching optimality in the contextual stochastic block model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01361v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to process data associated with graphs. They are finding an increasing range of applications; however, as with other modern machine learning techniques, their theoretical understanding is limited. GNNs can encounter difficulties in gathering information from nodes that are far apart by iterated aggregation steps. This situation is partly caused by so-called oversmoothing; and overcoming it is one of the practically motivated challenges. We consider the situation where information is aggregated by multiple steps of convolution, leading to graph convolutional networks (GCNs). We analyze the generalization performance of a basic GCN, trained for node classification on data generated by the contextual stochastic block model. We predict its asymptotic performance by deriving the free energy of the problem, using the replica method, in the high-dimensional limit. Calling depth the number of convolutional steps, we show the importance of going to large depth to approach the Bayes-optimality. We detail how the architecture of the GCN has to scale with the depth to avoid oversmoothing. The resulting large depth limit can be close to the Bayes-optimality and leads to a continuous GCN. Technically, we tackle this continuous limit via an approach that resembles dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) with constraints at the initial and final times. An expansion around large regularization allows us to solve the corresponding equations for the performance of the deep GCN. This promising tool may contribute to the analysis of further deep neural networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00537v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models are highly vulnerable to label flipping, i.e., the adversarial modification (poisoning) of training labels to compromise performance. Thus, deriving robustness certificates is important to guarantee that test predictions remain unaffected and to understand worst-case robustness behavior. However, for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the problem of certifying label flipping has so far been unsolved. We change this by introducing an exact certification method, deriving both sample-wise and collective certificates. Our method leverages the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) to capture the training dynamics of wide networks enabling us to reformulate the bilevel optimization problem representing label flipping into a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP). We apply our method to certify a broad range of GNN architectures in node classification tasks. Thereby, concerning the worst-case robustness to label flipping: $(i)$ we establish hierarchies of GNNs on different benchmark graphs; $(ii)$ quantify the effect of architectural choices such as activations, depth and skip-connections; and surprisingly, $(iii)$ uncover a novel phenomenon of the robustness plateauing for intermediate perturbation budgets across all investigated datasets and architectures. While we focus on GNNs, our certificates are applicable to sufficiently wide NNs in general through their NTK. Thus, our work presents the first exact certificate to a poisoning attack ever derived for neural networks, which could be of independent interest.

However, existing methods, which typically rely on single experiments, often reach a performance bottleneck and face limitations in handling diverse interference structures. In contrast, we propose leveraging multiple experiments to overcome these limitations. In industry, the use of sequential experiments, often known as the ramp-up process, where traffic to the treatment gradually increases, is common due to operational needs like risk management and cost control. Our approach shifts the focus from operational aspects to the statistical advantages of merging data from multiple experiments. By combining data from sequentially conducted experiments, we aim to estimate the global average treatment effect more effectively. In this paper, we begin by analyzing the bias and variance of the linear regression estimator for GATE under general linear network interference. We demonstrate that bias plays a dominant role in the bias-variance tradeoff and highlight the intrinsic bias reduction achieved by merging data from experiments with strictly different treatment proportions. Herein the improvement introduced by merging two steps of experimental data is essential. In addition, we show that merging more steps of experimental data is unnecessary under general linear interference, while it can become beneficial when nonlinear interference occurs. Furthermore, we look into a more advanced estimator based on graph neural networks. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that the regression-based estimator benefits remarkably from training on merged experiment data, achieving outstanding statistical performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Soybean Disease Detection via Interpretable Hybrid CNN-GNN: Integrating MobileNetV2 and GraphSAGE with Cross-Modal Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01284v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soybean leaf disease detection is critical for agricultural productivity but faces challenges due to visually similar symptoms and limited interpretability in conventional methods. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in spatial feature extraction, they often neglect inter-image relational dependencies, leading to misclassifications. This paper proposes an interpretable hybrid Sequential CNN-Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that synergizes MobileNetV2 for localized feature extraction and GraphSAGE for relational modeling. The framework constructs a graph where nodes represent leaf images, with edges defined by cosine similarity-based adjacency matrices and adaptive neighborhood sampling. This design captures fine-grained lesion features and global symptom patterns, addressing inter-class similarity challenges. Cross-modal interpretability is achieved via Grad-CAM and Eigen-CAM visualizations, generating heatmaps to highlight disease-influential regions. Evaluated on a dataset of ten soybean leaf diseases, the model achieves $97.16\%$ accuracy, surpassing standalone CNNs ($\le95.04\%$) and traditional machine learning models ($\le77.05\%$). Ablation studies validate the sequential architecture's superiority over parallel or single-model configurations. With only 2.3 million parameters, the lightweight MobileNetV2-GraphSAGE combination ensures computational efficiency, enabling real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments. The proposed approach bridges the gap between accurate classification and practical applicability, offering a robust, interpretable tool for agricultural diagnostics while advancing CNN-GNN integration in plant pathology research.</p></details> |  |
| **[DCI: A Coordinated Allocation and Filling Workload-Aware Dual-Cache Allocation GNN Inference Acceleration System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01281v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for processing graph-structured data, increasingly used for large-scale real-world graphs via sampling-based inference methods. However, inherent characteristics of neighbor sampling lead to redundant data loading during GNN inference, compounded by inefficient data transfers between host and GPU memory, resulting in slow inference and low resource utilization. Existing methods to accelerate GNN inference face several challenges: (1) low practical GPU memory utilization, (2) overlooking adjacency matrix locality, and (3) long preprocessing time. To address these challenges, we introduce DCI, an efficient workload-aware dual-cache allocation system for GNN inference acceleration. DCI allocates cache capacities for both node features and adjacency matrices based on workload patterns during the pre-sampling phase, leveraging a lightweight cache-filling algorithm to optimize data loading efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that DCI accelerates sampling and node feature loading, achieving end-to-end inference speedups of 1.18$\times$ to 11.26$\times$ compared to DGL, and 1.14$\times$ to 13.68$\times$ over RAIN, while reducing preprocessing time by 52.8\% to 98.7\%. Additionally, DCI outperforms state-of-the-art single-cache inference systems by achieving speedup of 1.08$\times$ to 1.32$\times$. We also compared DCI with DUCATI's dual-cache population strategy. Our lightweight population algorithm allows DCI to achieve nearly the same inference speed while keeping preprocessing time to less than 20\% of that required by DUCATI.</p></details> |  |

However, the general applicability of these encodings and their potential to serve as foundational representations for graphs remain uncertain. This paper investigates the fine-tuning efficiency, scalability with sample size, and generalization capability of learnable PSEs across diverse graph datasets. Specifically, we evaluate their potential as universal pre-trained models that can be easily adapted to new tasks with minimal fine-tuning and limited data. Furthermore, we assess the expressivity of the learned representations, particularly, when used to augment downstream GNNs. We demonstrate through extensive benchmarking and empirical analysis that PSEs generally enhance downstream models. However, some datasets may require specific PSE-augmentations to achieve optimal performance. Nevertheless, our findings highlight their significant potential to become integral components of future graph foundation models. We provide new insights into the strengths and limitations of PSEs, contributing to the broader discourse on foundation models in graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at TMLR (https://openreview.net/forum?id=mSoDRZXsqj)</p></details> |

The most widely used pre-training methods currently involve either supervised training to fit a general force field or self-supervised training by denoising atomic structures equilibrium. Both methods require datasets generated from quantum mechanical calculations, which quickly become intractable when scaling to larger datasets. Here we propose a novel pre-training objective which instead uses cheaply-computed structural fingerprints as targets while maintaining comparable performance across a range of different structural descriptors. Our experiments show this approach can act as a general strategy for pre-training GNNs with application towards large scale foundational models for atomistic data.</p></details> |  |

For dynamic graph modeling, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a mainstream technique. However, they are generally pre-trained on the link prediction task, leaving a significant gap from the objectives of downstream tasks such as node classification. To bridge the gap, prompt-based learning has gained traction on graphs, but most existing efforts focus on static graphs, neglecting the evolution of dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose DYGPROMPT, a novel pre-training and prompt learning framework for dynamic graph modeling. First, we design dual prompts to address the gap in both task objectives and temporal variations across pre-training and downstream tasks. Second, we recognize that node and time features mutually characterize each other, and propose dual condition-nets to model the evolving node-time patterns in downstream tasks. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate and analyze DYGPROMPT through extensive experiments on four public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Accurate prediction of pavement distress deterioration is essential for effective road management, cost reduction in maintenance, and improvement of traffic safety. However, real-world data on pavement distress is usually collected irregularly, resulting in uneven, asynchronous, and sparse spatial-temporal datasets. This hinders the application of existing spatial-temporal models, such as DCRNN, since they are only applicable to regularly and synchronously collected data. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Graph Autoregression Network (STGAN), a novel graph neural network model designed for accurately predicting irregular pavement distress deterioration using complex spatial-temporal data. Specifically, STGAN integrates the temporal domain into the spatial domain, creating a larger graph where nodes are represented by spatial-temporal tuples and edges are formed based on a similarity-based connection mechanism. Furthermore, based on the constructed spatiotemporal graph, we formulate pavement distress deterioration prediction as a graph autoregression task, i.e., the graph size increases incrementally and the prediction is performed sequentially. This is accomplished by a novel spatial-temporal attention mechanism deployed by STGAN. Utilizing the ConTrack dataset, which contains pavement distress records collected from different locations in Shanghai, we demonstrate the superior performance of STGAN in capturing spatial-temporal correlations and addressing the aforementioned challenges. Experimental results further show that STGAN outperforms baseline models, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of its novel modules. Our findings contribute to promoting proactive road maintenance decision-making and ultimately enhancing road safety and resilience.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 16 figures, 4 tables, accepted by IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (TITS)</p></details> |

Recent advances on GNNs leverage geometric properties, such as curvature, to enhance its representation capabilities by modeling complex connectivity patterns and information flow within graphs. However, most existing approaches focus solely on discrete graph topology, overlooking diffusion dynamics and task-specific dependencies essential for effective learning. To address this, we propose integrating Bakry-\'Emery curvature, which captures both structural and task-driven aspects of information propagation. We develop an efficient, learnable approximation strategy, making curvature computation scalable for large graphs. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive depth mechanism that dynamically adjusts message-passing layers per vertex based on its curvature, ensuring efficient propagation. Our theoretical analysis establishes a link between curvature and feature distinctiveness, showing that high-curvature vertices require fewer layers, while low-curvature ones benefit from deeper propagation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing consistent performance improvements across diverse graph learning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network on Semantic Tree](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13496v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent past has seen an increasing interest in Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs), since many real-world graphs are heterogeneous in nature, from citation graphs to email graphs. However, existing methods ignore a tree hierarchy among metapaths, naturally constituted by different node types and relation types. In this paper, we present HetTree, a novel HGNN that models both the graph structure and heterogeneous aspects in a scalable and effective manner. Specifically, HetTree builds a semantic tree data structure to capture the hierarchy among metapaths. To effectively encode the semantic tree, HetTree uses a novel subtree attention mechanism to emphasize metapaths that are more helpful in encoding parent-child relationships. Moreover, HetTree proposes carefully matching pre-computed features and labels correspondingly, constituting a complete metapath representation. Our evaluation of HetTree on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrates that it outperforms all existing baselines on open benchmarks and efficiently scales to large real-world graphs with millions of nodes and edges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

KANs have already been integrated into various architectures, such as convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks, and transformers, and their potential has been assessed for predicting physical quantities. However, the combination of KANs with point-cloud-based neural networks (e.g., PointNet) for computational physics has not yet been explored. To address this, we present Kolmogorov-Arnold PointNet (KA-PointNet) as a novel supervised deep learning framework for the prediction of incompressible steady-state fluid flow fields in irregular domains, where the predicted fields are a function of the geometry of the domains. In KA-PointNet, we implement shared KANs in the segmentation branch of the PointNet architecture. We utilize Jacobi polynomials to construct shared KANs. As a benchmark test case, we consider incompressible laminar steady-state flow over a cylinder, where the geometry of its cross-section varies over the data set. We investigate the performance of Jacobi polynomials with different degrees as well as special cases of Jacobi polynomials such as Legendre polynomials, Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kinds, and Gegenbauer polynomials, in terms of the computational cost of training and accuracy of prediction of the test set. Additionally, we compare the performance of PointNet with shared KANs (i.e., KA-PointNet) and PointNet with shared MLPs. It is observed that when the number of trainable parameters is approximately equal, PointNet with shared KANs (i.e., KA-PointNet) outperforms PointNet with shared MLPs. Moreover, KA-PointNet predicts the pressure and velocity distributions along the surface of cylinders more accurately, resulting in more precise computations of lift and drag.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods often overlook the critical importance of preserving symmetry when generating scene graphs from 3D point clouds, which can lead to reduced accuracy and robustness, particularly when dealing with noisy, multi-view data. Furthermore, a major limitation of prior approaches is the lack of temporal modeling to capture time-dependent relationships among dynamically evolving entities in a scene. To address these challenges, we propose Temporal Equivariant Scene Graph Neural Network (TESGNN), consisting of two key components: (1) an Equivariant Scene Graph Neural Network (ESGNN), which extracts information from 3D point clouds to generate scene graph while preserving crucial symmetry properties, and (2) a Temporal Graph Matching Network, which fuses scene graphs generated by ESGNN across multiple time sequences into a unified global representation using an approximate graph-matching algorithm. Our combined architecture TESGNN outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in scene graph generation, achieving higher accuracy and faster training convergence. Moreover, we show that leveraging the symmetry-preserving property produces a more stable and accurate global scene representation compared to existing approaches. Last but not least, it is computationally efficient and easily implementable using existing frameworks, making it well-suited for real-time applications in robotics and computer vision. This approach paves the way for more robust and scalable solutions to complex multi-view scene understanding challenges.

Traditional machine learning models remain effective in resource-limited environments due to their efficiency, requiring fewer parameters and less computational time. However, handling short and highly imbalanced datasets remains challenging. In this study, we propose the fusion of a Contrastive Attentive Graph Network and Graph Attention Network (CAGN-GAT Fusion) and benchmark it against 15 other models, including both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and traditional ML models. Our evaluation is conducted on four benchmark datasets (KDD-CUP-1999, NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS2017) using a short and proportionally imbalanced dataset with a constant size of 5000 samples to ensure fairness in comparison. Results show that CAGN-GAT Fusion demonstrates stable and competitive accuracy, recall, and F1-score, even though it does not achieve the highest performance in every dataset. Our analysis also highlights the impact of adaptive graph construction techniques, including small changes in connections (edge perturbation) and selective hiding of features (feature masking), improving detection performance. The findings confirm that GNNs, particularly CAGN-GAT Fusion, are robust and computationally efficient, making them well-suited for resource-constrained environments. Future work will explore GraphSAGE layers and multiview graph construction techniques to further enhance adaptability and detection accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Yet, the ability of GNNs to capture structural interactions within graphs remains under-explored. In this work, we address this gap by drawing on the insight that permutation invariant graph partitioning enables a powerful way of exploring structural interactions. We establish theoretical connections between permutation invariant graph partitioning and graph isomorphism, and then propose Graph Partitioning Neural Networks (GPNNs), a novel architecture that efficiently enhances the expressive power of GNNs in learning structural interactions. We analyze how partitioning schemes and structural interactions contribute to GNN expressivity and their trade-offs with complexity. Empirically, we demonstrate that GPNNs outperform existing GNN models in capturing structural interactions across diverse graph benchmark tasks.</p></details> |  |

These interactions can be effectively represented as time-evolving graphs, where predicting future connections is a key task in applications such as recommendation systems. Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have achieved strong results for such predictive tasks but typically require extensive training data, which is often limited in real-world scenarios. One approach to mitigating data scarcity is leveraging pre-trained models from related datasets. However, direct knowledge transfer between TGNNs is challenging due to their reliance on node-specific memory structures, making them inherently difficult to adapt across datasets. To address this, we introduce a novel transfer approach that disentangles node representations from their associated features through a structured bipartite encoding mechanism. This decoupling enables more effective transfer of memory components and other learned inductive patterns from one dataset to another. Empirical evaluations on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances TGNN performance in low-data regimes, outperforming non-transfer baselines by up to 56\% and surpassing existing transfer strategies by 36\%</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review in SIGIR conference</p></details> |

However, inevitable objective gaps often exist between pre-training and downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, graph prompt tuning techniques design and learn graph prompts by manipulating input graphs or reframing downstream tasks as pre-training tasks without fine-tuning the pre-trained GNN models. While recent graph prompt tuning methods have proven effective in adapting pre-trained GNN models for downstream tasks, they overlook the crucial role of edges in graph prompt design, which can significantly affect the quality of graph representations for downstream tasks. In this study, we propose EdgePrompt, a simple yet effective graph prompt tuning method from the perspective of edges. Unlike previous studies that design prompt vectors on node features, EdgePrompt manipulates input graphs by learning additional prompt vectors for edges and incorporates the edge prompts through message passing in the pre-trained GNN models to better embed graph structural information for downstream tasks. Our method is compatible with prevalent GNN architectures pre-trained under various pre-training strategies and is universal for different downstream tasks. We provide comprehensive theoretical analyses of our method regarding its capability of handling node classification and graph classification as downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on ten graph datasets under four pre-training strategies demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method against six baselines.

They are used in many domains, from online social networks to complex molecules. Most GNNs leverage the message-passing paradigm and achieve strong performances on various tasks. However, the message-passing mechanism used in most models suffers from over-smoothing as a GNN's depth increases. The over-smoothing degrades GNN's performance due to the increased similarity between the representations of unrelated nodes. This study proposes an adaptive channel-wise message-passing approach to alleviate the over-smoothing. The proposed model, Channel-Attentive GNN, learns how to attend to neighboring nodes and their feature channels. Thus, much diverse information can be transferred between nodes during message-passing. Experiments with widely used benchmark datasets show that the proposed model is more resistant to over-smoothing than baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performances for various graphs with strong heterophily.

| **[Performance Heterogeneity in Graph Neural Networks: Lessons for Architecture Design and Preprocessing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00547v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks have emerged as the most popular architecture for graph-level learning, including graph classification and regression tasks, which frequently arise in areas such as biochemistry and drug discovery. Achieving good performance in practice requires careful model design. Due to gaps in our understanding of the relationship between model and data characteristics, this often requires manual architecture and hyperparameter tuning. This is particularly pronounced in graph-level tasks, due to much higher variation in the input data than in node-level tasks. To work towards closing these gaps, we begin with a systematic analysis of individual performance in graph-level tasks. Our results establish significant performance heterogeneity in both message-passing and transformer-based architectures. We then investigate the interplay of model and data characteristics as drivers of the observed heterogeneity. Our results suggest that graph topology alone cannot explain heterogeneity. Using the Tree Mover's Distance, which jointly evaluates topological and feature information, we establish a link between class-distance ratios and performance heterogeneity in graph classification. These insights motivate model and data preprocessing choices that account for heterogeneity between graphs. We propose a selective rewiring approach, which only targets graphs whose individual performance benefits from rewiring. We further show that the optimal network depth depends on the graph's spectrum, which motivates a heuristic for choosing the number of GNN layers. Our experiments demonstrate the utility of both design choices in practice.</p></details> |  |

It creates a significant barrier in transferring the acquired knowledge to different, heterogeneous data setups. This paper introduces GraphBridge, a novel framework to enable knowledge transfer across disparate tasks and domains in GNNs, circumventing the need for modifications to task configurations or graph structures. Specifically, GraphBridge allows for the augmentation of any pre-trained GNN with prediction heads and a bridging network that connects the input to the output layer. This architecture not only preserves the intrinsic knowledge of the original model but also supports outputs of arbitrary dimensions. To mitigate the negative transfer problem, GraphBridge merges the source model with a concurrently trained model, thereby reducing the source bias when applied to the target domain. Our method is thoroughly evaluated across diverse transfer learning scenarios, including Graph2Graph, Node2Node, Graph2Node, and graph2point-cloud. Empirical validation, conducted over 16 datasets representative of these scenarios, confirms the framework's capacity for task- and domain-agnostic transfer learning within graph-like data, marking a significant advancement in the field of GNNs.

However, current models do not effectively learn the joint distribution of atom types, fractional coordinates, and lattice structure of the crystal material in a cohesive end-to-end diffusion framework. Also, none of these models work under realistic setups, where users specify the desired characteristics that the generated structures must match. In this work, we introduce TGDMat, a novel text-guided diffusion model designed for 3D periodic material generation. Our approach integrates global structural knowledge through textual descriptions at each denoising step while jointly generating atom coordinates, types, and lattice structure using a periodic-E(3)-equivariant graph neural network (GNN). Extensive experiments using popular datasets on benchmark tasks reveal that TGDMat outperforms existing baseline methods by a good margin. Notably, for the structure prediction task, with just one generated sample, TGDMat outperforms all baseline models, highlighting the importance of text-guided diffusion. Further, in the generation task, TGDMat surpasses all baselines and their text-fusion variants, showcasing the effectiveness of the joint diffusion paradigm. Additionally, incorporating textual knowledge reduces overall training and sampling computational overhead while enhancing generative performance when utilizing real-world textual prompts from experts.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

We highlight the significance of this result in various contexts, including establishing a quantitative expressiveness hierarchy across different architectural variants, offering insights into the impact of GNN depth, and understanding the subgraph counting capabilities of spectral invariant GNNs. In particular, our results significantly extend Arvind et al. (2024) and settle their open questions.

Most research assumes ideal closed-set environments. However, in real-world open-set environments, graph learning models face challenges in robustness and reliability due to unseen classes. This highlights the need for Graph Open-Set Recognition (GOSR) methods to address these issues and ensure effective GNN application in practical scenarios. Research in GOSR is in its early stages, with a lack of a comprehensive benchmark spanning diverse tasks and datasets to evaluate methods. Moreover, traditional methods, Graph Out-of-Distribution Detection (GOODD), GOSR, and Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) have mostly evolved in isolation, with little exploration of their interconnections or potential applications to GOSR. To fill these gaps, we introduce \textbf{G-OSR}, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GOSR methods at both the node and graph levels, using datasets from multiple domains to ensure fair and standardized comparisons of effectiveness and efficiency across traditional, GOODD, GOSR, and GAD methods. The results offer critical insights into the generalizability and limitations of current GOSR methods and provide valuable resources for advancing research in this field through systematic analysis of diverse approaches.</p></details> | 10 pages,2 figures |

The use of graph autoencoders - with both encoder and decoder implemented as message passing networks - is intriguing due to their ability to generate permutation-invariant graph representations. However, this approach faces difficulties because decoding a graph structure from a single vector is challenging, and comparing input and output graphs requires an effective permutation-invariant similarity measure. As a result, many studies rely on approximate methods. In this work, we explore the effect of graph matching precision on the training behavior and generation capabilities of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Our contribution is two-fold: (1) we propose a transformer-based message passing graph decoder as an alternative to a graph neural network decoder, that is more robust and expressive by leveraging global attention mechanisms.

| **[Particle-based plasma simulation using a graph neural network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00274v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A surrogate model for particle-in-cell plasma simulations based on a graph neural network is presented. The graph is constructed in such a way as to enable the representation of electromagnetic fields on a fixed spatial grid. The model is applied to simulate beams of electrons in one dimension over a wide range of temperatures, drift momenta and densities, and is shown to reproduce two-stream instabilities - a common and fundamental plasma instability. Qualitatively, the characteristic phase-space mixing of counterpropagating electron beams is observed. Quantitatively, the model's performance is evaluated in terms of the accuracy of its predictions of number density distributions, the electric field, and their Fourier decompositions, particularly the growth rate of the fastest-growing unstable mode, as well as particle position, momentum distributions, energy conservation and run time. The model achieves high accuracy with a time step longer than conventional simulation by two orders of magnitude. This work demonstrates that complex plasma dynamics can be learned and shows promise for the development of fast differentiable simulators suitable for solving forward and inverse problems in plasma physics.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |

As opposed to conventional frame-based vision sensors, event-based cameras deliver a microsecond-scale temporal resolution with sparse information encoding, thereby outlining new opportunities for edge vision systems. However, mainstream algorithms for frame-based vision, which mostly rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can hardly exploit the advantages of event-based vision as they are typically optimized for dense matrix-vector multiplications. While event-driven graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as a promising solution for sparse event-based vision, their irregular structure is a challenge that currently hinders the design of efficient hardware accelerators. In this paper, we propose EvGNN, the first event-driven GNN accelerator for low-footprint, ultra-low-latency, and high-accuracy edge vision with event-based cameras. It relies on three central ideas: (i) directed dynamic graphs exploiting single-hop nodes with edge-free storage, (ii) event queues for the efficient identification of local neighbors within a spatiotemporally decoupled search range, and (iii) a novel layer-parallel processing scheme allowing for a low-latency execution of multi-layer GNNs. We deployed EvGNN on a Xilinx KV260 Ultrascale+ MPSoC platform and benchmarked it on the N-CARS dataset for car recognition, demonstrating a classification accuracy of 87.8% and an average latency per event of 16$\mu$s, thereby enabling real-time, microsecond-resolution event-based vision at the edge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Artificial Intelligence, 2025. 14 pages, 14 figures</p></details> |
| **[Improving Graph Neural Networks by Learning Continuous Edge Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14109v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) traditionally employ a message-passing mechanism that resembles diffusion over undirected graphs, which often leads to homogenization of node features and reduced discriminative power in tasks such as node classification. Our key insight for addressing this limitation is to assign fuzzy edge directions -- that can vary continuously from node $i$ pointing to node $j$ to vice versa -- to the edges of a graph so that features can preferentially flow in one direction between nodes to enable long-range information transmission across the graph. We also introduce a novel complex-valued Laplacian for directed graphs with fuzzy edges where the real and imaginary parts represent information flow in opposite directions. Using this Laplacian, we propose a general framework, called Continuous Edge Direction (CoED) GNN, for learning on graphs with fuzzy edges and prove its expressivity limits using a generalization of the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) graph isomorphism test for directed graphs with fuzzy edges. Our architecture aggregates neighbor features scaled by the learned edge directions and processes the aggregated messages from in-neighbors and out-neighbors separately alongside the self-features of the nodes. Since continuous edge directions are differentiable, they can be learned jointly with the GNN weights via gradient-based optimization. CoED GNN is particularly well-suited for graph ensemble data where the graph structure remains fixed but multiple realizations of node features are available, such as in gene regulatory networks, web connectivity graphs, and power grids. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real graph ensemble datasets that learning continuous edge directions significantly improves performance both for undirected and directed graphs compared with existing methods.</p></details> |  |

The use of custom hardware architectures proves particularly beneficial for GNNs due to their irregular memory access patterns, resulting from the sparse structure of graphs. However, existing FPGA accelerators are limited by their double buffering mechanism, which doesn't account for the irregular node distribution in typical graph datasets. To address this, we introduce \textbf{AMPLE} (Accelerated Message Passing Logic Engine), an FPGA accelerator leveraging a new event-driven programming flow. We develop a mixed-arithmetic architecture, enabling GNN inference to be quantized at a node-level granularity. Finally, prefetcher for data and instructions is implemented to optimize off-chip memory access and maximize node parallelism. Evaluation on citation and social media graph datasets ranging from $2$K to $700$K nodes showed a mean speedup of $243\times$ and $7.2\times$ against CPU and GPU counterparts, respectively.</p></details> |  |

GNN transferability allows training on smaller graphs and applying the model to larger ones, but existing methods often rely on random subsampling, leading to disconnected subgraphs and reduced model expressivity. We propose a novel graph sampling algorithm that leverages feature homophily to preserve graph structure. By minimizing the trace of the data correlation matrix, our method better preserves the graph Laplacian trace -- a proxy for the graph connectivity -- than random sampling, while achieving lower complexity than spectral methods. Experiments on citation networks show improved performance in preserving Laplacian trace and GNN transferability compared to random sampling.</p></details> |  |
| **[MuseGNN: Forming Scalable, Convergent GNN Layers that Minimize a Sampling-Based Energy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12457v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Among the many variants of graph neural network (GNN) architectures capable of modeling data with cross-instance relations, an important subclass involves layers designed such that the forward pass iteratively reduces a graph-regularized energy function of interest. In this way, node embeddings produced at the output layer dually serve as both predictive features for solving downstream tasks (e.g., node classification) and energy function minimizers that inherit transparent, exploitable inductive biases and interpretability. However, scaling GNN architectures constructed in this way remains challenging, in part because the convergence of the forward pass may involve models with considerable depth. To tackle this limitation, we propose a sampling-based energy function and scalable GNN layers that iteratively reduce it, guided by convergence guarantees in certain settings. We also instantiate a full GNN architecture based on these designs, and the model achieves competitive accuracy and scalability when applied to the largest publicly-available node classification benchmark exceeding 1TB in size.

However, as models scale, their limited capacity becomes a significant challenge for adapting to novel scenarios. It is increasingly difficult to improve models for new situations using a single monolithic model. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of dynamically enhancing a basic driving planner with local driving data, without permanently modifying the planner itself. This approach, termed the Dynamically Local-Enhancement (DLE) Planner, aims to improve the scalability of autonomous driving systems without significantly expanding the planner's size. Our approach introduces a position-varying Markov Decision Process formulation coupled with a graph neural network that extracts region-specific driving features from local observation data. The learned features describe the local behavior of the surrounding objects, which is then leveraged to enhance a basic reinforcement learning-based policy. We evaluated our approach in multiple scenarios and compared it with a one-for-all driving model. The results show that our method outperforms the baseline policy in both safety (collision rate) and average reward, while maintaining a lighter scale. This approach has the potential to benefit large-scale autonomous vehicles without the need for largely expanding on-device driving models.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Oversquashing in Graph Neural Networks Through the Lens of Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01009v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common problem in Message-Passing Neural Networks is oversquashing -- the limited ability to facilitate effective information flow between distant nodes. Oversquashing is attributed to the exponential decay in information transmission as node distances increase. This paper introduces a novel perspective to address oversquashing, leveraging dynamical systems properties of global and local non-dissipativity, that enable the maintenance of a constant information flow rate. We present SWAN, a uniquely parameterized GNN model with antisymmetry both in space and weight domains, as a means to obtain non-dissipativity. Our theoretical analysis asserts that by implementing these properties, SWAN offers an enhanced ability to transmit information over extended distances. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world benchmarks that emphasize long-range interactions validate the theoretical understanding of SWAN, and its ability to mitigate oversquashing.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

Many existing machine learning models struggle to provide comprehensive interpretability, often failing to extract meaningful biomarkers from imaging data, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), or lacking mechanisms to explain the significance of non-imaging data. In this paper, we propose the Interpretable Information Bottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (I2B-HGNN), a novel framework designed to learn from fine-grained local patterns to comprehensive global multi-modal interactions. This framework comprises two key modules. The first module, the Information Bottleneck Graph Transformer (IBGraphFormer) for local patterns, integrates global modeling with brain connectomic-constrained graph neural networks to identify biomarkers through information bottleneck-guided pooling. The second module, the Information Bottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (IB-HGAN) for global multi-modal interactions, facilitates interpretable multi-modal fusion of imaging and non-imaging data using heterogeneous graph neural networks. The results of the experiments demonstrate that I2B-HGNN excels in diagnosing NDDs with high accuracy, providing interpretable biomarker identification and effective analysis of non-imaging data.</p></details> |  |

In addition to real-valued GNNs, quaternion GNNs also perform well on tasks on graph-structured data. With the aim of reducing the energy footprint, we reduce the model size while maintaining accuracy comparable to that of the original-sized GNNs. This paper introduces Quaternion Message Passing Neural Networks (QMPNNs), a framework that leverages quaternion space to compute node representations. Our approach offers a generalizable method for incorporating quaternion representations into GNN architectures at one-fourth of the original parameter count. Furthermore, we present a novel perspective on Graph Lottery Tickets, redefining their applicability within the context of GNNs and QMPNNs. We specifically aim to find the initialization lottery from the subnetwork of the GNNs that can achieve comparable performance to the original GNN upon training. Thereby reducing the trainable model parameters even further. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed QMPNN framework and LTH for both GNNs and QMPNNs, we evaluate their performance on real-world datasets across three fundamental graph-based tasks: node classification, link prediction, and graph classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, accepted at PAKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Generating Clinically Realistic EHR Data via a Hierarchy- and Semantics-Guided Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20719v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating realistic synthetic electronic health records (EHRs) holds tremendous promise for accelerating healthcare research, facilitating AI model development and enhancing patient privacy. However, existing generative methods typically treat EHRs as flat sequences of discrete medical codes. This approach overlooks two critical aspects: the inherent hierarchical organization of clinical coding systems and the rich semantic context provided by code descriptions. Consequently, synthetic patient sequences often lack high clinical fidelity and have limited utility in downstream clinical tasks. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchy- and Semantics-Guided Transformer (HiSGT), a novel framework that leverages both hierarchical and semantic information for the generative process. HiSGT constructs a hierarchical graph to encode parent-child and sibling relationships among clinical codes and employs a graph neural network to derive hierarchy-aware embeddings. These are then fused with semantic embeddings extracted from a pre-trained clinical language model (e.g., ClinicalBERT), enabling the Transformer-based generator to more accurately model the nuanced clinical patterns inherent in real EHRs. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that HiSGT significantly improves the statistical alignment of synthetic data with real patient records, as well as supports robust downstream applications such as chronic disease classification. By addressing the limitations of conventional raw code-based generative models, HiSGT represents a significant step toward clinically high-fidelity synthetic data generation and a general paradigm suitable for interpretable medical code representation, offering valuable applications in data augmentation and privacy-preserving healthcare analytics.</p></details> |  |

These online activities raise significant social concerns that require immediate actions. Existing approaches to combating this challenge are generally impractical, due to the imbalance of classes and scarcity of labeled samples in real-world applications. To this end, we propose a novel Large Language Model-empowered Heterogeneous Graph Prompt Learning framework for illicit Drug Trafficking detection, called LLM-HetGDT, that leverages LLM to facilitate heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) to effectively identify drug trafficking activities in the class-imbalanced scenarios. Specifically, we first pre-train HGNN over a contrastive pretext task to capture the inherent node and structure information over the unlabeled drug trafficking heterogeneous graph (HG). Afterward, we employ LLM to augment the HG by generating high-quality synthetic user nodes in minority classes. Then, we fine-tune the soft prompts on the augmented HG to capture the important information in the minority classes for the downstream drug trafficking detection task. To comprehensively study online illicit drug trafficking activities, we collect a new HG dataset over Twitter, called Twitter-HetDrug. Extensive experiments on this dataset demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and applicability of LLM-HetGDT.</p></details> |  |

This is particularly problematic in high stakes applications where accurate uncertainty estimates are essential. Existing post hoc methods, such as temperature scaling, fail to effectively utilize graph structures, while current GNN calibration methods often overlook the potential of leveraging diverse input information and model ensembles jointly. In the paper, we propose Graph Ensemble Temperature Scaling, a novel calibration framework that combines input and model ensemble strategies within a Graph Mixture of Experts archi SOTA calibration techniques, reducing expected calibration error by 25 percent across 10 GNN benchmark datasets. Additionally, GETS is computationally efficient, scalable, and capable of selecting effective input combinations for improved calibration performance.

We focus on reasoning in relational domains, where the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) seems like a natural choice. However, previous work has shown that regular GNNs lack the ability to systematically generalize from training examples on test graphs requiring longer inference chains, which fundamentally limits their reasoning abilities. A common solution relies on neuro-symbolic methods that systematically reason by learning rules, but their scalability is often limited and they tend to make unrealistically strong assumptions, e.g.\ that the answer can always be inferred from a single relational path. We propose the Epistemic GNN (EpiGNN), a novel parameter-efficient and scalable GNN architecture with an epistemic inductive bias for systematic reasoning. Node embeddings in EpiGNNs are treated as epistemic states, and message passing is implemented accordingly. We show that EpiGNNs achieve state-of-the-art results on link prediction tasks that require systematic reasoning. Furthermore, for inductive knowledge graph completion, EpiGNNs rival the performance of state-of-the-art specialized approaches. Finally, we introduce two new benchmarks that go beyond standard relational reasoning by requiring the aggregation of information from multiple paths. Here, existing neuro-symbolic approaches fail, yet EpiGNNs learn to reason accurately.

However, learnable update rules can be costly and unstable to train and use. Recently, Jang et al. (2023) proposed a simpler approach to accelerate training based on weight nowcaster networks (WNNs). In their approach, Adam is used for most of the optimization steps and periodically, only every few steps, a WNN nowcasts (predicts near future) parameters. We improve WNNs by proposing neuron interaction and nowcasting (NiNo) networks. In contrast to WNNs, NiNo leverages neuron connectivity and graph neural networks to more accurately nowcast parameters. We further show that in some networks, such as Transformers, modeling neuron connectivity accurately is challenging. We address this and other limitations, which allows NiNo to accelerate Adam training by up to 50% in vision and language tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025, code is https://github.com/SamsungSAILMontreal/nino</p></details> |

The CAMETA framework consists of three components: a path planning layer generating potential path suggestions, a multi-agent ETA prediction layer predicting the arrival times for all agents based on the paths, and lastly, a path selection layer that calculates the accumulated cost and selects the best path. The novelty of the CAMETA framework lies in the heterogeneous map representation and the heterogeneous graph neural network architecture. As a result of the proposed novel structure, CAMETA improves the generalization capability compared to the state-of-the-art methods that rely on structured road infrastructure and historical data. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the multi-agent ETA prediction layer, with a mean average percentage error improvement of 29.5% and 44% when compared to a traditional path planning method (A *) which does not consider conflicts. The performance of the CAMETA framework shows significant improvements in terms of robustness to noise and conflicts as well as determining proficient routes compared to state-of-the-art multi-agent path planners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by "International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems" - IROS 2023</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Graph Neural Networks and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Inventory Control in Supply Chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18631v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inventory control in modern supply chains has attracted significant attention due to the increasing number of disruptive shocks and the challenges posed by complex dynamics, uncertainties, and limited collaboration. Traditional methods, which often rely on static parameters, struggle to adapt to changing environments. This paper proposes a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for state representation to address these limitations. Our approach redefines the action space by parameterizing heuristic inventory control policies, making it adaptive as the parameters dynamically adjust based on system conditions. By leveraging the inherent graph structure of supply chains, our framework enables agents to learn the system's topology, and we employ a centralized learning, decentralized execution scheme that allows agents to learn collaboratively while overcoming information-sharing constraints. Additionally, we incorporate global mean pooling and regularization techniques to enhance performance. We test the capabilities of our proposed approach on four different supply chain configurations and conduct a sensitivity analysis. This work paves the way for utilizing MARL-GNN frameworks to improve inventory management in complex, decentralized supply chain environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sustainable Greenhouse Management: A Comparative Analysis of Recurrent and Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17371v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems into greenhouses not only optimizes land use but also enhances sustainable agricultural practices by enabling dual benefits of food production and renewable energy generation. However, accurate prediction of internal environmental conditions is crucial to ensure optimal crop growth while maximizing energy production. This study introduces a novel application of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) to greenhouse microclimate modeling, comparing their performance with traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). While RNNs excel at temporal pattern recognition, they cannot explicitly model the directional relationships between environmental variables. Our STGNN approach addresses this limitation by representing these relationships as directed graphs, enabling the model to capture both spatial dependencies and their directionality. Using high-frequency data collected at 15-minute intervals from a greenhouse in Volos, Greece, we demonstrate that RNNs achieve exceptional accuracy in winter conditions (R^2 = 0.985) but show limitations during summer cooling system operation. Though STGNNs currently show lower performance (winter R^2 = 0.947), their architecture offers greater potential for integrating additional variables such as PV generation and crop growth indicators.</p></details> |  |

Despite its potential to advance diverse research fields like social networks and e-commerce, MAG representation learning (MAGRL) remains underexplored due to the lack of standardized datasets and evaluation frameworks. In this paper, we first propose MAGB, a comprehensive MAG benchmark dataset, featuring curated graphs from various domains with both textual and visual attributes. Based on MAGB dataset, we further systematically evaluate two mainstream MAGRL paradigms: $\textit{GNN-as-Predictor}$, which integrates multimodal attributes via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and $\textit{VLM-as-Predictor}$, which harnesses Vision Language Models (VLMs) for zero-shot reasoning. Extensive experiments on MAGB reveal following critical insights: $\textit{(i)}$ Modality significances fluctuate drastically with specific domain characteristics. $\textit{(ii)}$ Multimodal embeddings can elevate the performance ceiling of GNNs. However, intrinsic biases among modalities may impede effective training, particularly in low-data scenarios. $\textit{(iii)}$ VLMs are highly effective at generating multimodal embeddings that alleviate the imbalance between textual and visual attributes. These discoveries, which illuminate the synergy between multimodal attributes and graph topologies, contribute to reliable benchmarks, paving the way for future MAG research.

A critical step in this process is identifying pixel-to-point correspondences between 2D query images and 3D models. Most advanced approaches currently rely on extensive visual descriptors to establish these correspondences, facing challenges in storage, privacy issues and model maintenance. Direct 2D-3D keypoint matching without visual descriptors is becoming popular as it can overcome those challenges. However, existing descriptor-free methods suffer from low accuracy or heavy computation. Addressing this gap, this paper introduces the Angle-Annular Graph Neural Network (A2-GNN), a simple approach that efficiently learns robust geometric structural representations with annular feature extraction. Specifically, this approach clusters neighbors and embeds each group's distance information and angle as supplementary information to capture local structures.

One such approach, GNNAutoScale (GAS), uses graph partitioning to enable training under constrained GPU memory. GAS also stores historical embedding vectors, which are retrieved from one-hop neighbors in other partitions, ensuring critical information is captured across partition boundaries. The historical embeddings which come from the previous training iteration are stale compared to the GAS estimated embeddings, resulting in approximation errors of the training algorithm. Furthermore, these errors accumulate over multiple layers, leading to suboptimal node embeddings. To address this shortcoming, we propose two enhancements: first, WaveGAS, inspired by waveform relaxation, performs multiple forward passes within GAS before the backward pass, refining the approximation of historical embeddings and gradients to improve accuracy; second, a gradient-tracking method that stores and utilizes more accurate historical gradients during training. Empirical results show that WaveGAS enhances GAS and achieves better accuracy, even outperforming methods that train on full graphs, thanks to its robust estimation of node embeddings.</p></details> |  |

Here we introduce a universal decoder based on linear attention sequence modeling and graph neural network that operates directly on any stabilizer code's graph structure. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that this decoder outperforms specialized algorithms in both accuracy and speed across diverse stabilizer codes, including surface codes, color codes, and QLDPC codes. The decoder maintains linear time scaling with syndrome measurements and requires no structural modifications between different codes. For the Bivariate Bicycle code with distance 12, our approach achieves a 39.4% lower logical error rate than previous best decoders while requiring only ~1% of the decoding time. These results provide a practical, universal solution for quantum error correction, eliminating the need for code-specific decoders.</p></details> |  |
| **[ADAGE: Active Defenses Against GNN Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00065v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) achieve high performance in various real-world applications, such as drug discovery, traffic states prediction, and recommendation systems. The fact that building powerful GNNs requires a large amount of training data, powerful computing resources, and human expertise turns the models into lucrative targets for model stealing attacks. Prior work has revealed that the threat vector of stealing attacks against GNNs is large and diverse, as an attacker can leverage various heterogeneous signals ranging from node labels to high-dimensional node embeddings to create a local copy of the target GNN at a fraction of the original training costs. This diversity in the threat vector renders the design of effective and general defenses challenging and existing defenses usually focus on one particular stealing setup. Additionally, they solely provide means to identify stolen model copies rather than preventing the attack. To close this gap, we propose the first and general Active Defense Against GNN Extraction (ADAGE). By analyzing the queries to the GNN, tracking their diversity in terms of proximity to different communities identified in the underlying graph, and increasing the defense strength with the growing fraction of communities that have been queried, ADAGE can prevent stealing in all common attack setups. Our extensive experimental evaluation using six benchmark datasets, four GNN models, and three types of adaptive attackers shows that ADAGE penalizes attackers to the degree of rendering stealing impossible, whilst not harming predictive performance for legitimate users.

Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly through Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have significantly enhanced the accuracy of these forecasts by capturing complex spatio-temporal dynamics. However, the scalability of GNNs remains a challenge due to their exponential growth in model complexity with increasing nodes in the graph. Existing methods to address this issue, including sparsification, decomposition, and kernel-based approaches, either do not fully resolve the complexity issue or risk compromising predictive accuracy. This paper introduces GraphSparseNet (GSNet), a novel framework designed to improve both the scalability and accuracy of GNN-based traffic forecasting models. GraphSparseNet is comprised of two core modules: the Feature Extractor and the Relational Compressor. These modules operate with linear time and space complexity, thereby reducing the overall computational complexity of the model to a linear scale. Our extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that GraphSparseNet not only significantly reduces training time by 3.51x compared to state-of-the-art linear models but also maintains high predictive performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Graph Transformers: Architectures, Theories and Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16533v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformers (GTs) have demonstrated a strong capability in modeling graph structures by addressing the intrinsic limitations of graph neural networks (GNNs), such as over-smoothing and over-squashing. Recent studies have proposed diverse architectures, enhanced explainability, and practical applications for Graph Transformers. In light of these rapid developments, we conduct a comprehensive review of Graph Transformers, covering aspects such as their architectures, theoretical foundations, and applications within this survey. We categorize the architecture of Graph Transformers according to their strategies for processing structural information, including graph tokenization, positional encoding, structure-aware attention and model ensemble. Furthermore, from the theoretical perspective, we examine the expressivity of Graph Transformers in various discussed architectures and contrast them with other advanced graph learning algorithms to discover the connections. Furthermore, we provide a summary of the practical applications where Graph Transformers have been utilized, such as molecule, protein, language, vision, traffic, brain and material data. At the end of this survey, we will discuss the current challenges and prospective directions in Graph Transformers for potential future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Transformer with GNN Structural Knowledge via Distillation: A Novel Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01888v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating the structural inductive biases of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the global contextual modeling capabilities of Transformers represents a pivotal challenge in graph representation learning. While GNNs excel at capturing localized topological patterns through message-passing mechanisms, their inherent limitations in modeling long-range dependencies and parallelizability hinder their deployment in large-scale scenarios. Conversely, Transformers leverage self-attention mechanisms to achieve global receptive fields but struggle to inherit the intrinsic graph structural priors of GNNs. This paper proposes a novel knowledge distillation framework that systematically transfers multiscale structural knowledge from GNN teacher models to Transformer student models, offering a new perspective on addressing the critical challenges in cross-architectural distillation. The framework effectively bridges the architectural gap between GNNs and Transformers through micro-macro distillation losses and multiscale feature alignment. This work establishes a new paradigm for inheriting graph structural biases in Transformer architectures, with broad application prospects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accurate and Scalable Graph Neural Networks via Message Invariance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19693v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message passing-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in many real-world applications. For a sampled mini-batch of target nodes, the message passing process is divided into two parts: message passing between nodes within the batch (MP-IB) and message passing from nodes outside the batch to those within it (MP-OB). However, MP-OB recursively relies on higher-order out-of-batch neighbors, leading to an exponentially growing computational cost with respect to the number of layers. Due to the neighbor explosion, the whole message passing stores most nodes and edges on the GPU such that many GNNs are infeasible to large-scale graphs. To address this challenge, we propose an accurate and fast mini-batch approach for large graph transductive learning, namely topological compensation (TOP), which obtains the outputs of the whole message passing solely through MP-IB, without the costly MP-OB. The major pillar of TOP is a novel concept of message invariance, which defines message-invariant transformations to convert costly MP-OB into fast MP-IB. This ensures that the modified MP-IB has the same output as the whole message passing. Experiments demonstrate that TOP is significantly faster than existing mini-batch methods by order of magnitude on vast graphs (millions of nodes and billions of edges) with limited accuracy degradation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training Robust Graph Neural Networks by Modeling Noise Dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19670v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world applications, node features in graphs often contain noise from various sources, leading to significant performance degradation in GNNs. Although several methods have been developed to enhance robustness, they rely on the unrealistic assumption that noise in node features is independent of the graph structure and node labels, thereby limiting their applicability. To this end, we introduce a more realistic noise scenario, dependency-aware noise on graphs (DANG), where noise in node features create a chain of noise dependencies that propagates to the graph structure and node labels. We propose a novel robust GNN, DA-GNN, which captures the causal relationships among variables in the data generating process (DGP) of DANG using variational inference. In addition, we present new benchmark datasets that simulate DANG in real-world applications, enabling more practical research on robust GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DA-GNN consistently outperforms existing baselines across various noise scenarios, including both DANG and conventional noise models commonly considered in this field.</p></details> | Work in progress |

HDGL maps node features into a very high-dimensional space (\textit{hyperdimensional} or HD space for short) using the \emph{injectivity} property of node representations in a family of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and then uses HD operators such as \textit{bundling} and \textit{binding} to aggregate information from the local neighborhood of each node yielding latent node representations that can support both node classification and link prediction tasks. HDGL, unlike GNNs that rely on computationally expensive iterative optimization and hyperparameter tuning, requires only a single pass through the data set. We report results of experiments using widely used benchmark datasets which demonstrate that, on the node classification task, HDGL achieves accuracy that is competitive with that of the state-of-the-art GNN methods at substantially reduced computational cost; and on the link prediction task, HDGL matches the performance of DeepWalk and related methods, although it falls short of computationally demanding state-of-the-art GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WSDM 2025</p></details> |

While exact solutions are often not necessary, many applications require finding high-quality solutions quickly. For this purpose, we propose a data-driven approach to improve existing non-learned approximation algorithms for CO. We parameterize the approximation algorithm and train a graph neural network (GNN) to predict parameter values that lead to the best possible solutions. Our pipeline is trained end-to-end in a self-supervised fashion using gradient estimation, treating the approximation algorithm as a black box. We propose a novel gradient estimation scheme for this purpose, which we call preference-based gradient estimation. Our approach combines the benefits of the neural network and the non-learned approximation algorithm: The GNN leverages the information from the dataset to allow the approximation algorithm to find better solutions, while the approximation algorithm guarantees that the solution is feasible. We validate our approach on two well-known combinatorial optimization problems, the travelling salesman problem and the minimum k-cut problem, and show that our method is competitive with state of the art learned CO solvers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary work, under review</p></details> |
| **[Energy-based Epistemic Uncertainty for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04043v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In domains with interdependent data, such as graphs, quantifying the epistemic uncertainty of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) is challenging as uncertainty can arise at different structural scales. Existing techniques neglect this issue or only distinguish between structure-aware and structure-agnostic uncertainty without combining them into a single measure. We propose GEBM, an energy-based model (EBM) that provides high-quality uncertainty estimates by aggregating energy at different structural levels that naturally arise from graph diffusion. In contrast to logit-based EBMs, we provably induce an integrable density in the data space by regularizing the energy function. We introduce an evidential interpretation of our EBM that significantly improves the predictive robustness of the GNN. Our framework is a simple and effective post hoc method applicable to any pre-trained GNN that is sensitive to various distribution shifts. It consistently achieves the best separation of in-distribution and out-of-distribution data on 6 out of 7 anomaly types while having the best average rank over shifts on \emph{all} datasets.</p></details> |  |

Quantum capability learning with physics-aware neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05636v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize diverse fields, including quantum chemistry, materials science, and machine learning. However, contemporary quantum computers experience errors that often cause quantum programs run on them to fail. Until quantum computers can reliably execute large quantum programs, stakeholders will need fast and reliable methods for assessing a quantum computer's capability-i.e., the programs it can run and how well it can run them. Previously, off-the-shelf neural network architectures have been used to model quantum computers' capabilities, but with limited success, because these networks fail to learn the complex quantum physics that determines real quantum computers' errors. We address this shortcoming with a new quantum-physics-aware neural network architecture for learning capability models. Our architecture combines aspects of graph neural networks with efficient approximations to the physics of errors in quantum programs. This approach achieves up to $\sim50\%$ reductions in mean absolute error on both experimental and simulated data, over state-of-the-art models based on convolutional neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables, includes conference checklist</p></details> |

Decentralized controller design has been inspired by self-organization found in nature, with a prominent source of inspiration being flocking; however, decentralized controllers struggle to maintain flock cohesion. The graph neural network (GNN) architecture has emerged as an indispensable machine learning tool for developing decentralized controllers capable of maintaining flock cohesion, but they fail to exploit the symmetries present in flocking dynamics, hindering their generalizability. We enforce rotation equivariance and translation invariance symmetries in decentralized flocking GNN controllers and achieve comparable flocking control with 70% less training data and 75% fewer trainable weights than existing GNN controllers without these symmetries enforced. We also show that our symmetry-aware controller generalizes better than existing GNN controllers.

However, most convolutional neural network-based methods typically focus on a single scale, neglecting the incorporation of multi-scale information. In image restoration tasks, local features of an image are often insufficient, necessitating the integration of global features to complement them. Although recent neural network algorithms have made significant strides in feature extraction, many models do not explicitly model global features or consider the relationship between global and local features. This paper proposes multi-level attention-guided graph neural network. The proposed network explicitly constructs element block graphs and element graphs within feature maps using multi-attention mechanisms to extract both local structural features and global representation information of the image. Since the network struggles to effectively extract global information during image degradation, the structural information of local feature blocks can be used to correct and supplement the global information. Similarly, when element block information in the feature map is missing, it can be refined using global element representation information. The graph within the network learns real-time dynamic connections through the multi-attention mechanism, and information is propagated and aggregated via graph convolution algorithms. By combining local element block information and global element representation information from the feature map, the algorithm can more effectively restore missing information in the image. Experimental results on several classic image restoration tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

In this paper the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) embedded into a relatively simple excess Gibbs energy model, the extended Margules model, for predicting vapor-liquid equilibrium is analyzed. By comparing its performance against the established UNIFAC-Dortmund model it has been shown that GNNs embedded in Margules achieves an overall lower accuracy. However, higher accuracy is observed in the case of various types of binary mixtures. Moreover, since group contribution methods, like UNIFAC, are limited due to feasibility of molecular fragmentation or availability of parameters, the GNN in Margules model offers an alternative for VLE estimation. The findings establish a baseline for the predictive accuracy that simple excess Gibbs energy models combined with GNNs trained solely on infinite dilution data can achieve.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods may cause misalignment problem in the feature fusion process and counter-intuitive patches in the segmentation results. Inspired by the popular pixel-node-pixel pipeline, we propose to 1) fuse features from two modalities in a late fusion style, during which the geometric feature injection is guided by texture feature prior; 2) employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on the fused feature to alleviate the emergence of irregular patches by inferring patch relationship. At the 3D feature extraction stage, we argue that traditional CNNs are not efficient enough for depth maps. So, we encode depth map into normal map, after which CNNs can easily extract object surface tendencies.At projection matrix generation stage, we find the existence of Biased-Assignment and Ambiguous-Locality issues in the original pipeline. Therefore, we propose to 1) adopt the Kullback-Leibler Loss to ensure no missing important pixel features, which can be viewed as hard pixel mining process; 2) connect regions that are close to each other in the Euclidean space as well as in the semantic space with larger edge weights so that location informations can been considered. Extensive experiments on two public datasets, NYU-DepthV2 and SUN RGB-D, have shown that our approach can consistently boost the performance of RGB-D semantic segmentation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>I hav...</summary><p>I have decided to withdraw this paper because I have recently obtained some new data and insights during my ongoing research</p></details> |

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a mainstream technique for graph-based applications, but their performance heavily relies on abundant labeled data. To reduce labeling requirement, pre-training and prompt learning has become a popular alternative. However, most existing prompt methods do not differentiate homophilic and heterophilic characteristics of real-world graphs. In particular, many real-world graphs are non-homophilic, not strictly or uniformly homophilic with mixing homophilic and heterophilic patterns, exhibiting varying non-homophilic characteristics across graphs and nodes. In this paper, we propose ProNoG, a novel pre-training and prompt learning framework for such non-homophilic graphs. First, we analyze existing graph pre-training methods, providing theoretical insights into the choice of pre-training tasks. Second, recognizing that each node exhibits unique non-homophilic characteristics, we propose a conditional network to characterize the node-specific patterns in downstream tasks. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate and analyze ProNoG through extensive experiments on ten public datasets.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

We aim to design the active beamforming vectors at the base station (BS) and the passive beamforming at the STAR-RIS to maximize the user sum rate under transmitting power constraints. The formulated problem is non-convex and nontrivial to obtain the global optimum due to the coupling between active beamforming vectors and STAR-RIS phase shifts. To efficiently solve the problem, we propose a novel graph neural network (GNN)-based framework. Specifically, we first model the interactions among users and network entities are using a heterogeneous graph representation. A heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) implementation is then introduced to directly optimizes beamforming vectors and STAR-RIS coefficients with the system objective. Numerical results show that the proposed approach yields efficient performance compared to the previous benchmarks. Furthermore, the proposed GNN is scalable with various system configurations.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and molecular glue degraders (MGDs) are the primary small molecules that induce TPD. Both types of molecules form a ternary complex linking an E3 ligase with a target protein, a crucial step for drug discovery. While significant advances have been made in binary structure prediction for proteins and small molecules, ternary structure prediction remains challenging due to obscure interaction mechanisms and insufficient training data. Traditional methods relying on manually assigned rules perform poorly and are computationally demanding due to extensive random sampling. In this work, we introduce DeepTernary, a novel deep learning-based approach that directly predicts ternary structures in an end-to-end manner using an encoder-decoder architecture. DeepTernary leverages an SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network (GNN) with both intra-graph and ternary inter-graph attention mechanisms to capture intricate ternary interactions from our collected high-quality training dataset, TernaryDB. The proposed query-based Pocket Points Decoder extracts the 3D structure of the final binding ternary complex from learned ternary embeddings, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy and speed in existing PROTAC benchmarks without prior knowledge from known PROTACs. It also achieves notable accuracy on the more challenging MGD benchmark under the blind docking protocol. Remarkably, our experiments reveal that the buried surface area calculated from predicted structures correlates with experimentally obtained degradation potency-related metrics. Consequently, DeepTernary shows potential in effectively assisting and accelerating the development of TPDs for previously undruggable targets.</p></details> |  |

To address this, numerous temporal graph neural networks (temporal GNNs) and benchmark datasets have been developed. However, these datasets often feature excessive repeated edges and lack complex sequential dynamics, a key characteristic inherent in many real-world applications such as recommender systems and ``Who-To-Follow'' on social networks. This oversight has led existing methods to inadvertently downplay the importance of learning sequential dynamics, focusing primarily on predicting repeated edges. In this study, we demonstrate that existing methods, such as GraphMixer and DyGFormer, are inherently incapable of learning simple sequential dynamics, such as ``a user who has followed OpenAI and Anthropic is more likely to follow AI at Meta next.'' Motivated by this issue, we introduce the Temporal Graph Benchmark with Sequential Dynamics (TGB-Seq), a new benchmark carefully curated to minimize repeated edges, challenging models to learn sequential dynamics and generalize to unseen edges. TGB-Seq comprises large real-world datasets spanning diverse domains, including e-commerce interactions, movie ratings, business reviews, social networks, citation networks and web link networks. Benchmarking experiments reveal that current methods usually suffer significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs on TGB-Seq, posing new challenges and opportunities for future research.

While attention-based architectures and self-supervised learning have achieved notable success, their application to tabular data remains less effective over linear and tree based models. Although several breakthroughs have been achieved by models which transform tables into uni-modal transformations like image, language and graph, these models often underperform in the presence of feature heterogeneity. To address this gap, we introduce TabGLM (Tabular Graph Language Model), a novel multi-modal architecture designed to model both structural and semantic information from a table. TabGLM transforms each row of a table into a fully connected graph and serialized text, which are then encoded using a graph neural network (GNN) and a text encoder, respectively. By aligning these representations through a joint, multi-modal, self-supervised learning objective, TabGLM leverages complementary information from both modalities, thereby enhancing feature learning. TabGLM's flexible graph-text pipeline efficiently processes heterogeneous datasets with significantly fewer parameters over existing Deep Learning approaches. Evaluations across 25 benchmark datasets demonstrate substantial performance gains, with TabGLM achieving an average AUC-ROC improvement of up to 5.56% over State-of-the-Art (SoTA) tabular learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Traditional graph learning models like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have made significant strides, but their capabilities in handling graph data remain limited in certain contexts. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising candidates for graph tasks, yet most studies focus primarily on performance benchmarks and fail to address their broader potential, including their ability to handle limited data, their transferability across tasks, and their robustness. In this work, we provide a comprehensive exploration of LLMs applied to graph tasks. We evaluate the performance of pure LLMs, including those without parameter optimization and those fine-tuned with instructions, across various scenarios. Our analysis goes beyond accuracy, assessing LLM ability to perform in few-shot/zero-shot settings, transfer across domains, understand graph structures, and demonstrate robustness in challenging scenarios. We conduct extensive experiments with 16 graph learning models alongside 6 LLMs (e.g., Llama3B, GPT-4o, Qwen-plus), comparing their performance on datasets like Cora, PubMed, ArXiv, and Products. Our findings show that LLMs, particularly those with instruction tuning, outperform traditional models in few-shot settings, exhibit strong domain transferability, and demonstrate excellent generalization and robustness. This work offers valuable insights into the capabilities of LLMs for graph learning, highlighting their advantages and potential for real-world applications, and paving the way for future research in this area.

Attention Graphs aggregate attention matrices across Transformer layers and heads to describe how information flows among input nodes. Through experiments on homophilous and heterophilous node classification tasks, we analyze Attention Graphs from a network science perspective and find that: (1) When Graph Transformers are allowed to learn the optimal graph structure using all-to-all attention among input nodes, the Attention Graphs learned by the model do not tend to correlate with the input/original graph structure; and (2) For heterophilous graphs, different Graph Transformer variants can achieve similar performance while utilising distinct information flow patterns.

While Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (GNODEs) have shown promise in learning node representations, they lack the ability to quantify uncertainty. To address this, we introduce Latent Graph Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (LGNSDE), which enhance GNODE by embedding randomness through a Bayesian prior-posterior mechanism for epistemic uncertainty and Brownian motion for aleatoric uncertainty. By leveraging the existence and uniqueness of solutions to graph-based SDEs, we prove that the variance of the latent space bounds the variance of model outputs, thereby providing theoretically sensible guarantees for the uncertainty estimates. Furthermore, we show mathematically that LGNSDEs are robust to small perturbations in the input, maintaining stability over time. Empirical results across several benchmarks demonstrate that our framework is competitive in out-of-distribution detection, robustness to noise, and active learning, underscoring the ability of LGNSDEs to quantify uncertainty reliably.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025 as Spotlight. 17 pages including appendix</p></details> |

Nevertheless, current endeavors for cross-graph node classification mainly focus on model training. Data augmentation approaches, a simple and easy-to-implement domain generalization technique, remain under-explored. In this paper, we develop a new graph structure augmentation for the crossgraph domain generalization problem. Specifically, low-weight edgedropping is applied to remove potential noise edges that may hinder the generalization ability of GNNs, stimulating the GNNs to capture the essential invariant information underlying different structures. Meanwhile, clustering-based edge-adding is proposed to generate invariant structures based on the node features from the same distribution. Consequently, with these augmentation techniques, the GNNs can maintain the domain invariant structure information that can improve the generalization ability. The experiments on out-ofdistribution citation network datasets verify our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among conventional augmentations.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Self-Explainable Heterogeneous GNN for Relational Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00521v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, significant attention has been given to the idea of viewing relational databases as heterogeneous graphs, enabling the application of graph neural network (GNN) technology for predictive tasks. However, existing GNN methods struggle with the complexity of the heterogeneous graphs induced by databases with numerous tables and relations. Traditional approaches either consider all possible relational meta-paths, thus failing to scale with the number of relations, or rely on domain experts to identify relevant meta-paths. A recent solution does manage to learn informative meta-paths without expert supervision, but assumes that a node's class depends solely on the existence of a meta-path occurrence. In this work, we present a self-explainable heterogeneous GNN for relational data, that supports models in which class membership depends on aggregate information obtained from multiple occurrences of a meta-path. Experimental results show that in the context of relational databases, our approach effectively identifies informative meta-paths that faithfully capture the model's reasoning mechanisms. It significantly outperforms existing methods in both synthetic and real-world scenario.</p></details> |  |
