| **[FLEXtime: Filterbank learning to explain time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05841v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art methods for explaining predictions from time series involve learning an instance-wise saliency mask for each time step; however, many types of time series are difficult to interpret in the time domain, due to the inherently complex nature of the data. Instead, we propose to view time series explainability as saliency maps over interpretable parts, leaning on established signal processing methodology on signal decomposition. Specifically, we propose a new method called FLEXtime that uses a bank of bandpass filters to split the time series into frequency bands. Then, we learn the combination of these bands that optimally explains the model's prediction. Our extensive evaluation shows that, on average, FLEXtime outperforms state-of-the-art explainability methods across a range of datasets. FLEXtime fills an important gap in the current time series explainability methodology and is a valuable tool for a wide range of time series such as EEG and audio. Code will be made available at https://github.com/theabrusch/FLEXtime.</p></details> |  |

Vision compression can alleviate this problem by reducing the vision token count. Previous approaches compress vision tokens with external modules and force LLMs to understand the compressed ones, leading to visual information loss. However, the LLMs' understanding paradigm of vision tokens is not fully utilised in the compression learning process. We propose VoCo-LLaMA, the first approach to compress vision tokens using LLMs. By introducing Vision Compression tokens during the vision instruction tuning phase and leveraging attention distillation, our method distill how LLMs comprehend vision tokens into their processing of VoCo tokens. VoCo-LLaMA facilitates effective vision compression and improves the computational efficiency during the inference stage. Specifically, our method achieves minimal performance loss with a compression ratio of 576$\times$, resulting in up to 94.8$\%$ fewer FLOPs and 69.6$\%$ acceleration in inference time. Furthermore, through continuous training using time-series compressed token sequences of video frames, VoCo-LLaMA demonstrates the ability to understand temporal correlations, outperforming previous methods on popular video question-answering benchmarks. Our approach presents a promising way to unlock the full potential of VLMs' contextual window, enabling more scalable multi-modal applications.

| **[ReFocus: Reinforcing Mid-Frequency and Key-Frequency Modeling for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16890v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements have progressively incorporated frequency-based techniques into deep learning models, leading to notable improvements in accuracy and efficiency for time series analysis tasks. However, the Mid-Frequency Spectrum Gap in the real-world time series, where the energy is concentrated at the low-frequency region while the middle-frequency band is negligible, hinders the ability of existing deep learning models to extract the crucial frequency information. Additionally, the shared Key-Frequency in multivariate time series, where different time series share indistinguishable frequency patterns, is rarely exploited by existing literature. This work introduces a novel module, Adaptive Mid-Frequency Energy Optimizer, based on convolution and residual learning, to emphasize the significance of mid-frequency bands. We also propose an Energy-based Key-Frequency Picking Block to capture shared Key-Frequency, which achieves superior inter-series modeling performance with fewer parameters. A novel Key-Frequency Enhanced Training strategy is employed to further enhance Key-Frequency modeling, where spectral information from other channels is randomly introduced into each channel. Our approach advanced multivariate time series forecasting on the challenging Traffic, ECL, and Solar benchmarks, reducing MSE by 4%, 6%, and 5% compared to the previous SOTA iTransformer.

| **[Scintillation pulse characterization with spectrum-inspired temporal neural networks: case studies on particle detector signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07267v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Particle detectors based on scintillators are widely used in high-energy physics and astroparticle physics experiments, nuclear medicine imaging, industrial and environmental detection, etc. Precisely extracting scintillation signal characteristics at the event level is important for these applications, not only in respect of understanding the scintillator itself, but also kinds and physical property of incident particles. Recent researches demonstrate data-driven neural networks surpass traditional statistical methods, especially when the analytical form of signals is hard to obtain, or noise is significant. However, most densely connected or convolution-based networks fail to fully exploit the spectral and temporal structure of scintillation signals, leaving large space for performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a network architecture specially tailored for scintillation pulse characterization based on previous works on time series analysis. The core insight is that, by directly applying Fast Fourier Transform on original signals and utilizing different frequency components, the proposed network architecture can serve as a lightweight and enhanced representation learning backbone. We prove our idea in two case studies: (a) simulation data generated with the setting of the LUX dark matter detector, and (b) experimental electrical signals with fast electronics to emulate scintillation variations for the NICA/MPD calorimeter. The proposed model achieves significantly better results than the reference model in literature and densely connected models, and demonstrates higher cost-efficiency than conventional machine learning methods.</p></details> | 29 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Compositional simulation-based inference for time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02728v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Amortized simulation-based inference (SBI) methods train neural networks on simulated data to perform Bayesian inference. While this strategy avoids the need for tractable likelihoods, it often requires a large number of simulations and has been challenging to scale to time series data. Scientific simulators frequently emulate real-world dynamics through thousands of single-state transitions over time. We propose an SBI approach that can exploit such Markovian simulators by locally identifying parameters consistent with individual state transitions. We then compose these local results to obtain a posterior over parameters that align with the entire time series observation. We focus on applying this approach to neural posterior score estimation but also show how it can be applied, e.g., to neural likelihood (ratio) estimation. We demonstrate that our approach is more simulation-efficient than directly estimating the global posterior on several synthetic benchmark tasks and simulators used in ecology and epidemiology. Finally, we validate scalability and simulation efficiency of our approach by applying it to a high-dimensional Kolmogorov flow simulator with around one million data dimensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the proceedings of the Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025), Singapore, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Timer-XL: Long-Context Transformers for Unified Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04803v4)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Timer-XL, a causal Transformer for unified time series forecasting. To uniformly predict multidimensional time series, we generalize next token prediction, predominantly adopted for 1D token sequences, to multivariate next token prediction. The paradigm formulates various forecasting tasks as a long-context prediction problem. We opt for decoder-only Transformers that capture causal dependencies from varying-length contexts for unified forecasting, making predictions on non-stationary univariate time series, multivariate series with complicated dynamics and correlations, as well as covariate-informed contexts that include exogenous variables. Technically, we propose a universal TimeAttention to capture fine-grained intra- and inter-series dependencies of flattened time series tokens (patches), which is further enhanced by deft position embedding for temporal causality and variable equivalence. Timer-XL achieves state-of-the-art performance across task-specific forecasting benchmarks through a unified approach. Based on large-scale pre-training, Timer-XL achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, making it a promising architecture for pre-trained time series models. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/thuml/Timer-XL.</p></details> |  |
| **[End-to-End Modeling Hierarchical Time Series Using Autoregressive Transformer and Conditional Normalizing Flow based Reconciliation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13706v3)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting with hierarchical structure is pervasive in real-world applications, demanding not only predicting each level of the hierarchy, but also reconciling all forecasts to ensure coherency, i.e., the forecasts should satisfy the hierarchical aggregation constraints. Moreover, the disparities of statistical characteristics between levels can be huge, worsened by non-Gaussian distributions and non-linear correlations. To this extent, we propose a novel end-to-end hierarchical time series forecasting model, based on conditioned normalizing flow-based autoregressive transformer reconciliation, to represent complex data distribution while simultaneously reconciling the forecasts to ensure coherency. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, we achieve the forecasting and reconciliation simultaneously without requiring any explicit post-processing step. In addition, by harnessing the power of deep model, we do not rely on any assumption such as unbiased estimates or Gaussian distribution. Our evaluation experiments are conducted on four real-world hierarchical datasets from different industrial domains (three public ones and a dataset from the application servers of Alipay's data center) and the preliminary results demonstrate efficacy of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 22nd IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM2022)</p></details> |
| **[Change Point Detection on A Separable Model for Dynamic Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17642v4)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the unsupervised change point detection problem in time series of networks using the Separable Temporal Exponential-family Random Graph Model (STERGM). Inherently, dynamic network patterns can be complex due to dyadic and temporal dependence, and change points detection can identify the discrepancies in the underlying data generating processes to facilitate downstream analysis. Moreover, the STERGM that utilizes network statistics to represent the structural patterns is a flexible and parsimonious model to fit dynamic networks. We propose a new estimator derived from the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) procedure and Group Fused Lasso (GFL) regularization to simultaneously detect multiple time points, where the parameters of a time-heterogeneous STERGM have changed. We also provide a Bayesian information criterion for model selection and an R package CPDstergm to implement the proposed method. Experiments on simulated and real data show good performance of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCDFN: Supply Chain Demand Forecasting via an Explainable Multi-Channel Data Fusion Network Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15598v5)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate demand forecasting is crucial for optimizing supply chain management. Traditional methods often fail to capture complex patterns from seasonal variability and special events. Despite advancements in deep learning, interpretable forecasting models remain a challenge. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Channel Data Fusion Network (MCDFN), a hybrid architecture that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to enhance predictive performance by extracting spatial and temporal features from time series data. Our comparative benchmarking demonstrates that MCDFN outperforms seven other deep-learning models, achieving superior metrics: MSE (23.5738), RMSE (4.8553), MAE (3.9991), and MAPE (20.1575%). Theil's U statistic of 0.1181 (U<1) of MCDFN indicates its superiority over the naive forecasting approach, and a 10-fold cross-validated statistical paired t-test with a p-value of 5% indicated no significant difference between MCDFN's predictions and actual values. We apply explainable AI techniques like ShapTime and Permutation Feature Importance to enhance interpretability. This research advances demand forecasting methodologies and offers practical guidelines for integrating MCDFN into supply chain systems, highlighting future research directions for scalability and user-friendly deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeMixer++: A General Time Series Pattern Machine for Universal Predictive Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16032v2)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis plays a critical role in numerous applications, supporting tasks such as forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. In this work, we present the time series pattern machine (TSPM), a model designed to excel in a broad range of time series tasks through powerful representation and pattern extraction capabilities. Traditional time series models often struggle to capture universal patterns, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. To address this, we define multiple scales in the time domain and various resolutions in the frequency domain, employing various mixing strategies to extract intricate, task-adaptive time series patterns. Specifically, we introduce a general-purpose TSPM that processes multi-scale time series using (1) multi-resolution time imaging (MRTI), (2) time image decomposition (TID), (3) multi-scale mixing (MCM), and (4) multi-resolution mixing (MRM) to extract comprehensive temporal patterns. MRTI transforms multi-scale time series into multi-resolution time images, capturing patterns across both temporal and frequency domains. TID leverages dual-axis attention to extract seasonal and trend patterns, while MCM hierarchically aggregates these patterns across scales. MRM adaptively integrates all representations across resolutions. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 time series analytical tasks, consistently surpassing both general-purpose and task-specific models. Our work marks a promising step toward the next generation of TSPMs, paving the way for further advancements in time series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[In Situ Optimization of an Optoelectronic Reservoir Computer with Digital Delayed Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11126v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir computing (RC) is an innovative paradigm in neuromorphic computing that leverages fixed, randomized, internal connections to address the challenge of overfitting. RC has shown remarkable effectiveness in signal processing and pattern recognition tasks, making it well-suited for hardware implementations across various physical substrates, which promise enhanced computation speeds and reduced energy consumption. However, achieving optimal performance in RC systems requires effective parameter optimization. Traditionally, this optimization has relied on software modeling, limiting the practicality of physical computing approaches. Here, we report an \emph{in situ} optimization method for an optoelectronic delay-based RC system with digital delayed feedback. By simultaneously optimizing five parameters, normalized mean squared error (NMSE) of 0.028, 0.561, and 0.271 is achieved in three benchmark tasks: waveform classification, time series prediction, and speech recognition outperforming simulation-based optimization (NMSE 0.054, 0.543, and 0.329, respectively) in the two of the three tasks. This method marks a significant advancement in physical computing, facilitating the optimization of RC and neuromorphic systems without the need for simulation, thus enhancing their practical applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript consists of 15 pages, including 6 figures, while the supplementary material comprises 3 pages with 2 additional figures, bringing the total to 8 figures across both documents</p></details> |
| **[Curse of Attention: A Kernel-Based Perspective for Why Transformers Fail to Generalize on Time Series Forecasting and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06061v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of transformer-based models on time series forecasting (TSF) tasks has long been popular to study. However, many of these works fail to beat the simple linear residual model, and the theoretical understanding of this issue is still limited. In this work, we propose the first theoretical explanation of the inefficiency of transformers on TSF tasks. We attribute the mechanism behind it to {\bf Asymmetric Learning} in training attention networks. When the sign of the previous step is inconsistent with the sign of the current step in the next-step-prediction time series, attention fails to learn the residual features. This makes it difficult to generalize on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, especially on the sign-inconsistent next-step-prediction data, with the same representation pattern, whereas a linear residual network could easily accomplish it. We hope our theoretical insights provide important necessary conditions for designing the expressive and efficient transformer-based architecture for practitioners.</p></details> | CPAL 2025 |
| **[TimesBERT: A BERT-Style Foundation Model for Time Series Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21245v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis is crucial in diverse scenarios. Beyond forecasting, considerable real-world tasks are categorized into classification, imputation, and anomaly detection, underscoring different capabilities termed time series understanding in this paper. While GPT-style models have been positioned as foundation models for time series forecasting, the BERT-style architecture, which has made significant advances in natural language understanding, has not been fully unlocked for time series understanding, possibly attributed to the undesirable dropout of essential elements of BERT. In this paper, inspired by the shared multi-granularity structure between multivariate time series and multisentence documents, we design TimesBERT to learn generic representations of time series including temporal patterns and variate-centric characteristics. In addition to a natural adaptation of masked modeling, we propose a parallel task of functional token prediction to embody vital multi-granularity structures. Our model is pre-trained on 260 billion time points across diverse domains. Leveraging multi-granularity representations, TimesBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance across four typical downstream understanding tasks, outperforming task-specific models and language pre-trained backbones, positioning it as a versatile foundation model for time series understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Kolmogorov Barrier: A Learnable Weighted Hybrid Autoencoder for Model Order Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18148v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</p></details> | 31 pages |
| **[SPAM: Spike-Aware Adam with Momentum Reset for Stable LLM Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06842v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across diverse tasks, yet their training remains highly resource-intensive and susceptible to critical challenges such as training instability. A predominant source of this instability stems from gradient and loss spikes, which disrupt the learning process, often leading to costly interventions like checkpoint recovery and experiment restarts, further amplifying inefficiencies. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into gradient spikes observed during LLM training, revealing their prevalence across multiple architectures and datasets. Our analysis shows that these spikes can be up to $1000\times$ larger than typical gradients, substantially deteriorating model performance. To address this issue, we propose Spike-Aware Adam with Momentum Reset SPAM, a novel optimizer designed to counteract gradient spikes through momentum reset and spike-aware gradient clipping. Extensive experiments, including both pre-training and fine-tuning, demonstrate that SPAM consistently surpasses Adam and its variants across various tasks, including (1) LLM pre-training from 60M to 1B, (2) 4-bit LLM pre-training,(3) reinforcement learning, and (4) Time Series Forecasting. Additionally, SPAM facilitates memory-efficient training by enabling sparse momentum, where only a subset of momentum terms are maintained and updated. When operating under memory constraints, SPAM outperforms state-of-the-art memory-efficient optimizers such as GaLore and Adam-Mini. Our work underscores the importance of mitigating gradient spikes in LLM training and introduces an effective optimization strategy that enhances both training stability and resource efficiency at scale.

| **[Zero-shot Imputation with Foundation Inference Models for Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07594v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) serve as models for a vast number of natural and social phenomena. In this work, we offer a fresh perspective on the classical problem of imputing missing time series data, whose underlying dynamics are assumed to be determined by ODEs. Specifically, we revisit ideas from amortized inference and neural operators, and propose a novel supervised learning framework for zero-shot time series imputation, through parametric functions satisfying some (hidden) ODEs. Our proposal consists of two components. First, a broad probability distribution over the space of ODE solutions, observation times and noise mechanisms, with which we generate a large, synthetic dataset of (hidden) ODE solutions, along with their noisy and sparse observations. Second, a neural recognition model that is trained offline, to map the generated time series onto the spaces of initial conditions and time derivatives of the (hidden) ODE solutions, which we then integrate to impute the missing data. We empirically demonstrate that one and the same (pretrained) recognition model can perform zero-shot imputation across 63 distinct time series with missing values, each sampled from widely different dynamical systems. Likewise, we demonstrate that it can perform zero-shot imputation of missing high-dimensional data in 10 vastly different settings, spanning human motion, air quality, traffic and electricity studies, as well as Navier-Stokes simulations -- without requiring any fine-tuning. What is more, our proposal often outperforms state-of-the-art methods, which are trained on the target datasets. Our pretrained model, repository and tutorials are available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are foundation models useful feature extractors for electroencephalography analysis?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21086v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of foundation models in natural language processing and computer vision has motivated similar approaches for general time series analysis. While these models are effective for a variety of tasks, their applicability in medical domains with limited data remains largely unexplored. To address this, we investigate the effectiveness of foundation models in medical time series analysis involving electroencephalography (EEG). Through extensive experiments on tasks such as age prediction, seizure detection, and the classification of clinically relevant EEG events, we compare their diagnostic accuracy with that of specialised EEG models. Our analysis shows that foundation models extract meaningful EEG features, outperform specialised models even without domain adaptation, and localise task-specific biomarkers. Moreover, we demonstrate that diagnostic accuracy is substantially influenced by architectural choices such as context length. Overall, our study reveals that foundation models with general time series understanding eliminate the dependency on large domain-specific datasets, making them valuable tools for clinical practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detection of anomalies in cow activity using wavelet transform based features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21051v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Precision Livestock Farming, detecting deviations from optimal or baseline values - i.e. anomalies in time series - is essential to allow undertaking corrective actions rapidly. Here we aim at detecting anomalies in 24h time series of cow activity, with a view to detect cases of disease or oestrus. Deviations must be distinguished from noise which can be very high in case of biological data. It is also important to detect the anomaly early, e.g. before a farmer would notice it visually. Here, we investigate the benefit of using wavelet transforms to denoise data and we assess the performance of an anomaly detection algorithm considering the timing of the detection. We developed features based on the comparisons between the wavelet transforms of the mean of the time series and the wavelet transforms of individual time series instances. We hypothesized that these features contribute to the detection of anomalies in periodic time series using a feature-based algorithm. We tested this hypothesis with two datasets representing cow activity, which typically follows a daily pattern but can deviate due to specific physiological or pathological conditions. We applied features derived from wavelet transform as well as statistical features in an Isolation Forest algorithm. We measured the distance of detection between the days annotated abnormal by animal caretakers days and the days predicted abnormal by the algorithm. The results show that wavelet-based features are among the features most contributing to anomaly detection. They also show that detections are close to the annotated days, and often precede it. In conclusion, using wavelet transforms on time series of cow activity data helps to detect anomalies related to specific cow states. The detection is often obtained on days that precede the day annotated by caretakers, which offer possibility to take corrective actions at an early stage.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables, 1 algorithm</p></details> |
| **[Forecasting Monthly Residential Natural Gas Demand Using Just-In-Time-Learning Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20989v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural gas (NG) is relatively a clean source of energy, particularly compared to fossil fuels, and worldwide consumption of NG has been increasing almost linearly in the last two decades. A similar trend can also be seen in Turkey, while another similarity is the high dependence on imports for the continuous NG supply. It is crucial to accurately forecast future NG demand (NGD) in Turkey, especially, for import contracts; in this respect, forecasts of monthly NGD for the following year are of utmost importance. In the current study, the historical monthly NG consumption data between 2014 and 2024 provided by SOCAR, the local residential NG distribution company for two cities in Turkey, Bursa and Kayseri, was used to determine out-of-sample monthly NGD forecasts for a period of one year and nine months using various time series models, including SARIMA and ETS models, and a novel proposed machine learning method. The proposed method, named Just-in-Time-Learning-Gaussian Process Regression (JITL-GPR), uses a novel feature representation for the past NG demand values; instead of using past demand values as column-wise separate features, they are placed on a two-dimensional (2-D) grid of year-month values. For each test point, a kernel function, tailored for the NGD predictions, is used in GPR to predict the query point. Since a model is constructed separately for each test point, the proposed method is, indeed, an example of JITL. The JITL-GPR method is easy to use and optimize, and offers a reduction in forecast errors compared to traditional time series methods and a state-of-the-art combination model; therefore, it is a promising tool for NGD forecasting in similar settings.</p></details> |  |

Its origins are multifaceted, resulting in various missing mechanisms. Prior research in this field has predominantly revolved around the assumption of the Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) mechanism. However, Missing At Random (MAR) and Missing Not At Random (MNAR) mechanisms, though equally prevalent, have often remained underexplored despite their significant influence. This PhD project presents a comprehensive research agenda designed to investigate the implications of diverse missing data mechanisms. The principal aim is to devise robust methodologies capable of effectively handling missing data while accommodating the unique characteristics of MCAR, MAR, and MNAR mechanisms. By addressing these gaps, this research contributes to an enriched understanding of the challenges posed by missing data across various industries and data modalities. It seeks to provide practical solutions that enable the effective management of missing data, empowering researchers and practitioners to leverage incomplete datasets confidently.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was presented at the ECML PKDD 2024 PhD Forum. https://ecmlpkdd. org/2024/program-accepted-phd-forum/</p></details> |
| **[Concealed Adversarial attacks on neural networks for sequential data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20948v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of deep learning led to the broad usage of neural networks in the time series domain for various applications, including finance and medicine. While powerful, these models are prone to adversarial attacks: a benign targeted perturbation of input data leads to significant changes in a classifier's output. However, formally small attacks in the time series domain become easily detected by the human eye or a simple detector model. We develop a concealed adversarial attack for different time-series models: it provides more realistic perturbations, being hard to detect by a human or model discriminator. To achieve this goal, the proposed adversarial attack maximizes an aggregation of a classifier and a trained discriminator loss. To make the attack stronger, we also propose a training procedure for a discriminator that provides broader coverage of possible attacks. Extensive benchmarking on six UCR time series datasets across four diverse architectures - including recurrent, convolutional, state-space, and transformer-based models - demonstrates the superiority of our attack for a concealability-efficiency trade-off. Our findings highlight the growing challenge of designing robust time series models, emphasizing the need for improved defenses against realistic and effective attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Statistical inference for large-dimensional tensor factor model by iterative projections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09800v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor Factor Models (TFM) are appealing dimension reduction tools for high-order large-dimensional tensor time series, and have wide applications in economics, finance and medical imaging. In this paper, we propose a projection estimator for the Tucker-decomposition based TFM, and provide its least-square interpretation which parallels to the least-square interpretation of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for the vector factor model. The projection technique simultaneously reduces the dimensionality of the signal component and the magnitudes of the idiosyncratic component tensor, thus leading to an increase of the signal-to-noise ratio. We derive a convergence rate of the projection estimator of the loadings and the common factor tensor which are faster than that of the naive PCA-based estimator. Our results are obtained under mild conditions which allow the idiosyncratic components to be weakly cross- and auto- correlated. We also provide a novel iterative procedure based on the eigenvalue-ratio principle to determine the factor numbers. Extensive numerical studies are conducted to investigate the empirical performance of the proposed projection estimators relative to the state-of-the-art ones.</p></details> |  |
| **[FACTS: A Factored State-Space Framework For World Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20922v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World modelling is essential for understanding and predicting the dynamics of complex systems by learning both spatial and temporal dependencies. However, current frameworks, such as Transformers and selective state-space models like Mambas, exhibit limitations in efficiently encoding spatial and temporal structures, particularly in scenarios requiring long-term high-dimensional sequence modelling. To address these issues, we propose a novel recurrent framework, the \textbf{FACT}ored \textbf{S}tate-space (\textbf{FACTS}) model, for spatial-temporal world modelling. The FACTS framework constructs a graph-structured memory with a routing mechanism that learns permutable memory representations, ensuring invariance to input permutations while adapting through selective state-space propagation. Furthermore, FACTS supports parallel computation of high-dimensional sequences. We empirically evaluate FACTS across diverse tasks, including multivariate time series forecasting, object-centric world modelling, and spatial-temporal graph prediction, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms or matches specialised state-of-the-art models, despite its general-purpose world modelling design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code released in https://github.com/NanboLi/FACTS</p></details> |
| **[Stochastic Optimal Control for Diffusion Bridges in Function Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20630v5)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion models and diffusion bridges primarily focus on finite-dimensional spaces, yet many real-world problems necessitate operations in infinite-dimensional function spaces for more natural and interpretable formulations. In this paper, we present a theory of stochastic optimal control (SOC) tailored to infinite-dimensional spaces, aiming to extend diffusion-based algorithms to function spaces. Specifically, we demonstrate how Doob's $h$-transform, the fundamental tool for constructing diffusion bridges, can be derived from the SOC perspective and expanded to infinite dimensions. This expansion presents a challenge, as infinite-dimensional spaces typically lack closed-form densities. Leveraging our theory, we establish that solving the optimal control problem with a specific objective function choice is equivalent to learning diffusion-based generative models. We propose two applications: (1) learning bridges between two infinite-dimensional distributions and (2) generative models for sampling from an infinite-dimensional distribution. Our approach proves effective for diverse problems involving continuous function space representations, such as resolution-free images, time-series data, and probability density functions.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-Dimensional Knockoffs Inference for Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09851v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We make some initial attempt to establish the theoretical and methodological foundation for the model-X knockoffs inference for time series data. We suggest the method of time series knockoffs inference (TSKI) by exploiting the ideas of subsampling and e-values to address the difficulty caused by the serial dependence. We also generalize the robust knockoffs inference in Barber, Cand\`es, and Samworth to the time series setting to relax the assumption of known covariate distribution required by model-X knockoffs, since such an assumption is overly stringent for time series data. We establish sufficient conditions under which TSKI achieves the asymptotic false discovery rate (FDR) control. Our technical analysis reveals the effects of serial dependence and unknown covariate distribution on the FDR control. We conduct a power analysis of TSKI using the Lasso coefficient difference knockoff statistic under the generalized linear time series models. The finite-sample performance of TSKI is illustrated with several simulation examples and an economic inflation study.</p></details> | 106 pages, 6 figures |

In this paper, we introduce temporal Wasserstein imputation, a novel method for imputing missing data in time series. Unlike existing techniques, our approach is fully nonparametric, circumventing the need for model specification prior to imputation, making it suitable for potential nonlinear dynamics. Its principled algorithmic implementation can seamlessly handle univariate or multivariate time series with any non-systematic missing pattern. In addition, the plausible range and side information of the missing entries (such as box constraints) can easily be incorporated. As a key advantage, our method mitigates the distributional bias typical of many existing approaches, ensuring more reliable downstream statistical analysis using the imputed series. Leveraging the benign landscape of the optimization formulation, we establish the convergence of an alternating minimization algorithm to critical points. We also provide conditions under which the marginal distributions of the underlying time series can be identified. Numerical experiments, including extensive simulations covering linear and nonlinear time series models and a real-world groundwater dataset laden with missing values, corroborate the practical usefulness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Amortized Control of Continuous State Space Feynman-Kac Model for Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05602v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world datasets, such as healthcare, climate, and economics, are often collected as irregular time series, which poses challenges for accurate modeling. In this paper, we propose the Amortized Control of continuous State Space Model (ACSSM) for continuous dynamical modeling of time series for irregular and discrete observations. We first present a multi-marginal Doob's $h$-transform to construct a continuous dynamical system conditioned on these irregular observations. Following this, we introduce a variational inference algorithm with a tight evidence lower bound (ELBO), leveraging stochastic optimal control (SOC) theory to approximate the intractable Doob's $h$-transform and simulate the conditioned dynamics. To improve efficiency and scalability during both training and inference, ACSSM leverages auxiliary variable to flexibly parameterize the latent dynamics and amortized control. Additionally, it incorporates a simulation-free latent dynamics framework and a transformer-based data assimilation scheme, facilitating parallel inference of the latent states and ELBO computation. Through empirical evaluations across a variety of real-world datasets, ACSSM demonstrates superior performance in tasks such as classification, regression, interpolation, and extrapolation, while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Compact Model for Large-Scale Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20634v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal data, which commonly arise in real-world applications such as traffic monitoring, financial transactions, and ride-share demands, represent a special category of multivariate time series. They exhibit two distinct characteristics: high dimensionality and commensurability across spatial locations. These attributes call for computationally efficient modeling approaches and facilitate the use of univariate forecasting models in a channel-independent fashion. SparseTSF, a recently introduced competitive univariate forecasting model, harnesses periodicity to achieve compactness by concentrating on cross-period dynamics, thereby extending the Pareto frontier with respect to model size and predictive performance. Nonetheless, it underperforms on spatio-temporal data due to an inadequate capture of intra-period temporal dependencies. To address this shortcoming, we propose UltraSTF, which integrates a cross-period forecasting module with an ultra-compact shape bank component. Our model effectively detects recurring patterns in time series through the attention mechanism of the shape bank component, thereby strengthening its ability to learn intra-period dynamics. UltraSTF achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LargeST benchmark while employing fewer than 0.2% of the parameters required by the second-best approaches, thus further extending the Pareto frontier of existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[LTSM-Bundle: A Toolbox and Benchmark on Large Language Models for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14045v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Forecasting (TSF) has long been a challenge in time series analysis. Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers are now developing Large Time Series Models (LTSMs)-universal transformer-based models that use autoregressive prediction-to improve TSF. However, training LTSMs on heterogeneous time series data poses unique challenges, including diverse frequencies, dimensions, and patterns across datasets. Recent endeavors have studied and evaluated various design choices aimed at enhancing LTSM training and generalization capabilities. However, these design choices are typically studied and evaluated in isolation and are not benchmarked collectively. In this work, we introduce LTSM-Bundle, a comprehensive toolbox, and benchmark for training LTSMs, spanning pre-processing techniques, model configurations, and dataset configuration. It modularized and benchmarked LTSMs from multiple dimensions, encompassing prompting strategies, tokenization approaches, training paradigms, base model selection, data quantity, and dataset diversity. Furthermore, we combine the most effective design choices identified in our study. Empirical results demonstrate that this combination achieves superior zero-shot and few-shot performances compared to state-of-the-art LTSMs and traditional TSF methods on benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[PFformer: A Position-Free Transformer Variant for Extreme-Adaptive Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20571v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting is vital in fields like weather, energy, and finance. However, despite deep learning advancements, traditional Transformer-based models often diminish the effect of crucial inter-variable relationships by singular token embedding and struggle to effectively capture complex dependencies among variables, especially in datasets with rare or extreme events. These events create significant imbalances and lead to high skewness, complicating accurate prediction efforts. This study introduces PFformer, a position-free Transformer-based model designed for single-target MTS forecasting, specifically for challenging datasets characterized by extreme variability. PFformer integrates two novel embedding strategies: Enhanced Feature-based Embedding (EFE) and Auto-Encoder-based Embedding (AEE). EFE effectively encodes inter-variable dependencies by mapping related sequence subsets to high-dimensional spaces without positional constraints, enhancing the encoder's functionality. PFformer shows superior forecasting accuracy without the traditional limitations of positional encoding in MTS modeling. We evaluated PFformer across four challenging datasets, focusing on two key forecasting scenarios: long sequence prediction for 3 days ahead and rolling predictions every four hours to reflect real-time decision-making processes in water management. PFformer demonstrated remarkable improvements, from 20% to 60%, compared with state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>PAKDD...</summary><p>PAKDD 2025 special session on Data Science: Foundations and Applications (DSFA)</p></details> |
| **[Time series forecasting based on optimized LLM for fault prediction in distribution power grid insulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17341v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surface contamination on electrical grid insulators leads to an increase in leakage current until an electrical discharge occurs, which can result in a power system shutdown. To mitigate the possibility of disruptive faults resulting in a power outage, monitoring contamination and leakage current can help predict the progression of faults. Given this need, this paper proposes a hybrid deep learning (DL) model for predicting the increase in leakage current in high-voltage insulators. The hybrid structure considers a multi-criteria optimization using tree-structured Parzen estimation, an input stage filter for signal noise attenuation combined with a large language model (LLM) applied for time series forecasting. The proposed optimized LLM outperforms state-of-the-art DL models with a root-mean-square error equal to 2.24$\times10^{-4}$ for a short-term horizon and 1.21$\times10^{-3}$ for a medium-term horizon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Signature Kernel Computations for Long Time Series via Local Neumann Series Expansions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20392v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The signature kernel is a recent state-of-the-art tool for analyzing high-dimensional sequential data, valued for its theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance. In this paper, we present a novel method for efficiently computing the signature kernel of long, high-dimensional time series via dynamically truncated recursive local power series expansions. Building on the characterization of the signature kernel as the solution of a Goursat PDE, our approach employs tilewise Neumann-series expansions to derive rapidly converging power series approximations of the signature kernel that are locally defined on subdomains and propagated iteratively across the entire domain of the Goursat solution by exploiting the geometry of the time series. Algorithmically, this involves solving a system of interdependent local Goursat PDEs by recursively propagating boundary conditions along a directed graph via topological ordering, with dynamic truncation adaptively terminating each local power series expansion when coefficients fall below machine precision, striking an effective balance between computational cost and accuracy. This method achieves substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art approaches for computing the signature kernel, providing (a) adjustable and superior accuracy, even for time series with very high roughness; (b) drastically reduced memory requirements; and (c) scalability to efficiently handle very long time series (e.g., with up to half a million points or more) on a single GPU. These advantages make our method particularly well-suited for rough-path-assisted machine learning, financial modeling, and signal processing applications that involve very long and highly volatile data.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Removing Neural Signal Artifacts with Autoencoder-Targeted Adversarial Transformers (AT-AT)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05332v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electromyogenic (EMG) noise is a major contamination source in EEG data that can impede accurate analysis of brain-specific neural activity. Recent literature on EMG artifact removal has moved beyond traditional linear algorithms in favor of machine learning-based systems. However, existing deep learning-based filtration methods often have large compute footprints and prohibitively long training times. In this study, we present a new machine learning-based system for filtering EMG interference from EEG data using an autoencoder-targeted adversarial transformer (AT-AT). By leveraging the lightweight expressivity of an autoencoder to determine optimal time-series transformer application sites, our AT-AT architecture achieves a >90% model size reduction compared to published artifact removal models. The addition of adversarial training ensures that filtered signals adhere to the fundamental characteristics of EEG data. We trained AT-AT using published neural data from 67 subjects and found that the system was able to achieve comparable test performance to larger models; AT-AT posted a mean reconstructive correlation coefficient above 0.95 at an initial signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 2 dB and 0.70 at -7 dB SNR. Further research generalizing these results to broader sample sizes beyond these isolated test cases will be crucial; while outside the scope of this study, we also include results from a real-world deployment of AT-AT in the Appendix.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CNS 2025, Boston, MA, USA</p></details> |

Dedicated hardware implementations based on functional neuromorphic structures significantly reduce energy consumption and/or increase computational capabilities of a given artificial neural network system. Concepts of RC, which as a flexible computational paradigm can be highly inclusive, are often used as a model to describe computations performed in materia. With mostly fixed internal structure, solid-state devices, especially memristors, are studied as computational substrates in various RC systems. In this work, we present single-node Echo State Machine (SNESM) RC system based on bridge synapse as a computational substrate (consisting of 4 memristors and a differential amplifier) used for epileptic seizure detection. KNOWM memristors were posed as ideal candidates because of their easy prototyping and reliability of operation. In this account, we present an application of commercially available KNOWM memristors in various neuromorphic applications, from simple analysis of switching and internal dynamics (elucidated form noise spectroscopy and total harmonic distortion analysis) to the classification and recognition of complex time series: epilepsy seizure recognition using a wrist-worn triaxial accelerometer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast $\ell_1$-Regularized EEG Source Localization Using Variable Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20304v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalograms (EEG) are invaluable for treating neurological disorders, however, mapping EEG electrode readings to brain activity requires solving a challenging inverse problem. Due to the time series data, the use of $\ell_1$ regularization quickly becomes intractable for many solvers, and, despite the reconstruction advantages of $\ell_1$ regularization, $\ell_2$-based approaches such as sLORETA are used in practice. In this work, we formulate EEG source localization as a graphical generalized elastic net inverse problem and present a variable projected algorithm (VPAL) suitable for fast EEG source localization. We prove convergence of this solver for a broad class of separable convex, potentially non-smooth functions subject to linear constraints and include a modification of VPAL that reconstructs time points in sequence, suitable for real-time reconstruction. Our proposed methods are compared to state-of-the-art approaches including sLORETA and other methods for $\ell_1$-regularized inverse problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Canonical Decomposition of Factor Models: Weak Factors are Everywhere](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10067v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are two approaches to time series approximate factor models: the static factor model, where the factors are loaded contemporaneously by the common component, and the Generalised Dynamic Factor Model, where the factors are loaded with lags. In this paper we derive a canonical decomposition which nests both models by introducing the weak common component which is the difference between the dynamic- and the static common component. Such component is driven by potentially infinitely many non-pervasive weak factors which live in the dynamically common space (not to be confused with rate-weak factors, being pervasive but associated with a slower rate). Our result shows that the relation between the two approaches is far more rich and complex than what usually assumed. We exemplify why the weak common component shall not be neglected by means of theoretical and empirical examples. Furthermore, we propose a simple estimation procedure for the canonical decomposition. Our empirical estimates on US macroeconomic data reveal that the weak common component can account for a large part of the variation of individual variables. Furthermore in a pseudo real-time forecasting evaluation for industrial production and inflation, we show that gains can be obtained from considering the dynamic approach over the static approach.</p></details> |  |

We represent images as matrix data and allow for temporal dependence, in addition to inherent spatial dependence, before and after the change. The marginal distributions are assumed to be general, not limited to any specific parametric distribution. We propose new monitoring statistics that utilize the low-rank structure of the in-control mean matrix. Additionally, we study the properties of the proposed detection procedure, assessing whether the monitoring statistics effectively capture a mean shift and evaluating the rate of increase in the average run length relative to the control limit in both the in-control and out-of-control cases. The effectiveness of our procedure is demonstrated through simulated and real data experiments.</p></details> | 30 pages, 7 figures |

While surgical intervention is often essential to prevent fatal outcomes, it carries significant risks both during the procedure and in the postoperative period, making the management of these conditions highly challenging. Parameters of cerebral blood flow, routinely monitored during medical interventions or with modern noninvasive high-resolution imaging methods, could potentially be utilized in machine learning-assisted protocols for risk assessment and therapeutic prognosis. To this end, we developed a linear oscillatory model of blood velocity and pressure for clinical data acquired from neurosurgical operations. Using the method of Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy), the parameters of our model can be reconstructed online within milliseconds from a short time series of the hemodynamic variables. The identified parameter values enable automated classification of the blood-flow pathologies by means of logistic regression, achieving an accuracy of 73 \%}. Our results demonstrate the potential of this model for both diagnostic and prognostic applications, providing a robust and interpretable framework for assessing cerebral blood vessel conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 main figures, 5 supplementary figures, 2 supplementary tables</p></details> |

By combining the multi-resolution framework of wavelets with the robustness of the Least Absolute Deviations (LAD) criterion, we introduce a periodogram providing a robust alternative to classical methods in the presence of non-Gaussian noise. Incorporating this periodogram into a log-periodogram regression, we develop a new estimator. Simulation studies demonstrate that our estimator outperforms the Geweke and Porter-Hudak (GPH) and Wavelet-Based Log-Periodogram (WBLP) estimators, particularly in terms of mean squared error, across various sample sizes and parameter configurations.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |

The SINDYc model has been trained on data coming from a nonlinear magnetic equivalent circuit model for three rotor eccentricity configurations. When evaluating the SINDYc model for static eccentricity, torques and UMPs with excellent accuracies, i.e., 8.8 mNm and 4.87 N of mean absolute error, respectively, are found. When compared with a reference torque equation, this amounts to a 65% error reduction. For dynamic eccentricity, the estimation is more difficult. The SINDYc model is fast enough to be embedded in a control procedure.</p></details> |  |

One of the key challenges is processing sequences with long-range dependencies. To that end, a recent line of work applied the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), which partitions the sequence into multiple subsequences and applies a Fourier transform to each separately. We propose the Frequency Information Aggregation (FIA)-Net, which is based on a novel complex-valued MLP architecture that aggregates adjacent window information in the frequency domain. To further increase the receptive field of the FIA-Net, we treat the set of windows as hyper-complex (HC) valued vectors and employ HC algebra to efficiently combine information from all STFT windows altogether. Using the HC-MLP backbone allows for improved handling of sequences with long-term dependence. Furthermore, due to the nature of HC operations, the HC-MLP uses up to three times fewer parameters than the equivalent standard window aggregation method. We evaluate the FIA-Net on various time-series benchmarks and show that the proposed methodologies outperform existing state of the art methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Our code is publicly available on https://anonymous.4open.science/r/research-1803/.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures.

The model is trained in a Bayesian framework that accounts for the uncertainty about the latent function and marginalizes it out when making predictions. We couple the latent GP variable with two types of forecast distributions: the negative binomial (NegBinGP) and the Tweedie distribution (TweedieGP). While the negative binomial has already been used in forecasting intermittent time series, this is the first time in which a fully parameterized Tweedie density is used for intermittent time series. We properly evaluate the Tweedie density, which is both zero-inflated and heavy tailed, avoiding simplifying assumptions made in existing models. We test our models on thousands of intermittent count time series. Results show that our models provide consistently better probabilistic forecasts than the competitors. In particular, TweedieGP obtains the best estimates of the highest quantiles, thus showing that it is more flexible than NegBinGP.</p></details> | Under review |

Such clinical applications are increasingly supported by machine learning methods, raising the question of the most appropriate input representation and model choice. Comprehensive comparisons, in particular across different input representations, are scarce. We address this gap in the research landscape by a comprehensive benchmarking study covering three kinds of input representations, interpretable features, image representations and raw waveforms, across prototypical regression and classification use cases: blood pressure and atrial fibrillation prediction. In both cases, the best results are achieved by deep neural networks operating on raw time series as input representations. Within this model class, best results are achieved by modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs). but depending on the task setup, shallow CNNs are often also very competitive. We envision that these results will be insightful for researchers to guide their choice on machine learning tasks for PPG data, even beyond the use cases presented in this work.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 9 figures, code available at https://gitlab.com/qumphy/d1-code</p></details> |

While recent techniques seek to address this for images, our findings show that these approaches fail to provide shift-invariance in time series, where the data generation mechanism is more challenging due to the interaction of low and high frequencies. Worse, they also decrease performance across several tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel differentiable bijective function that maps samples from their high-dimensional data manifold to another manifold of the same dimension, without any dimensional reduction. Our approach guarantees that samples -- when subjected to random shifts -- are mapped to a unique point in the manifold while preserving all task-relevant information without loss. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that the proposed transformation guarantees shift-invariance in deep learning models without imposing any limits to the shift. Our experiments on six time series tasks with state-of-the-art methods show that our approach consistently improves the performance while enabling models to achieve complete shift-invariance without modifying or imposing restrictions on the model's topology.

| **[Time-MoE: Billion-Scale Time Series Foundation Models with Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16040v4)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning for time series forecasting has seen significant advancements over the past decades. However, despite the success of large-scale pre-training in language and vision domains, pre-trained time series models remain limited in scale and operate at a high cost, hindering the development of larger capable forecasting models in real-world applications. In response, we introduce Time-MoE, a scalable and unified architecture designed to pre-train larger, more capable forecasting foundation models while reducing inference costs. By leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) design, Time-MoE enhances computational efficiency by activating only a subset of networks for each prediction, reducing computational load while maintaining high model capacity. This allows Time-MoE to scale effectively without a corresponding increase in inference costs. Time-MoE comprises a family of decoder-only transformer models that operate in an auto-regressive manner and support flexible forecasting horizons with varying input context lengths. We pre-trained these models on our newly introduced large-scale data Time-300B, which spans over 9 domains and encompassing over 300 billion time points. For the first time, we scaled a time series foundation model up to 2.4 billion parameters, achieving significantly improved forecasting precision. Our results validate the applicability of scaling laws for training tokens and model size in the context of time series forecasting. Compared to dense models with the same number of activated parameters or equivalent computation budgets, our models consistently outperform them by large margin. These advancements position Time-MoE as a state-of-the-art solution for tackling real-world time series forecasting challenges with superior capability, efficiency, and flexibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

Stroke predominantly affects older adults, with 75% of cases occurring in individuals aged 65 and older, underscoring the urgent need for tailored rehabilitation strategies in aging populations. Despite the critical role therapists play in evaluating rehabilitation progress and ensuring the effectiveness of treatment, current assessment methods can often be subjective, inconsistent, and time-consuming, leading to delays in adjusting therapy protocols. This study aims to address these challenges by providing a solution for consistent and timely analysis. Specifically, we perform temporal segmentation of video recordings to capture detailed activities during stroke patients' rehabilitation. The main application scenario motivating this study is the clinical assessment of daily tabletop object interactions, which are crucial for post-stroke physical rehabilitation. To achieve this, we present a framework that leverages the biomechanics of movement during therapy sessions. Our solution divides the process into two main tasks: 2D keypoint detection to track patients' physical movements, and 1D time-series temporal segmentation to analyze these movements over time. This dual approach enables automated labeling with only a limited set of real-world data, addressing the challenges of variability in patient movements and limited dataset availability. By tackling these issues, our method shows strong potential for practical deployment in physical therapy settings, enhancing the speed and accuracy of rehabilitation assessments.</p></details> |  |

Despite impressive advancements, this research area faces three key challenges. Firstly, the limited size of existing datasets impedes insights into modern battery life data. Secondly, most datasets are restricted to small-capacity lithium-ion batteries tested under a narrow range of diversity in labs, raising concerns about the generalizability of findings. Thirdly, inconsistent and limited benchmarks across studies obscure the effectiveness of baselines and leave it unclear if models popular in other time series fields are effective for BLP. To address these challenges, we propose BatteryLife, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for BLP. BatteryLife integrates 16 datasets, offering a 2.4 times sample size compared to the previous largest dataset, and provides the most diverse battery life resource with batteries from 8 formats, 80 chemical systems, 12 operating temperatures, and 646 charge/discharge protocols, including both laboratory and industrial tests. Notably, BatteryLife is the first to release battery life datasets of zinc-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and industry-tested large-capacity lithium-ion batteries. With the comprehensive dataset, we revisit the effectiveness of baselines popular in this and other time series fields. Furthermore, we propose CyclePatch, a plug-in technique that can be employed in a series of neural networks. Extensive benchmarking of 18 methods reveals that models popular in other time series fields can be unsuitable for BLP, and CyclePatch consistently improves model performance establishing state-of-the-art benchmarks.

The intersection of these two fields, termed diffusion models for anomaly detection (DMAD), offers promising solutions for identifying deviations in increasingly complex and high-dimensional data. In this survey, we review recent advances in DMAD research. We begin by presenting the fundamental concepts of AD and DMs, followed by a comprehensive analysis of classic DM architectures including DDPMs, DDIMs, and Score SDEs. We further categorize existing DMAD methods into reconstruction-based, density-based, and hybrid approaches, providing detailed examinations of their methodological innovations. We also explore the diverse tasks across different data modalities, encompassing image, time series, video, and multimodal data analysis. Furthermore, we discuss critical challenges and emerging research directions, including computational efficiency, model interpretability, robustness enhancement, edge-cloud collaboration, and integration with large language models.

| **[SigDiffusions: Score-Based Diffusion Models for Time Series via Log-Signature Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10354v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based diffusion models have recently emerged as state-of-the-art generative models for a variety of data modalities. Nonetheless, it remains unclear how to adapt these models to generate long multivariate time series. Viewing a time series as the discretisation of an underlying continuous process, we introduce SigDiffusion, a novel diffusion model operating on log-signature embeddings of the data. The forward and backward processes gradually perturb and denoise log-signatures while preserving their algebraic structure. To recover a signal from its log-signature, we provide new closed-form inversion formulae expressing the coefficients obtained by expanding the signal in a given basis (e.g. Fourier or orthogonal polynomials) as explicit polynomial functions of the log-signature. Finally, we show that combining SigDiffusions with these inversion formulae results in high-quality long time series generation, competitive with the current state-of-the-art on various datasets of synthetic and real-world examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Efficient 4D fMRI ASD Classification using Spatial-Temporal-Omics-based Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19386v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder impacting social and behavioral development. Resting-state fMRI, a non-invasive tool for capturing brain connectivity patterns, aids in early ASD diagnosis and differentiation from typical controls (TC). However, previous methods, which rely on either mean time series or full 4D data, are limited by a lack of spatial information or by high computational costs. This underscores the need for an efficient solution that preserves both spatial and temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel, simple, and efficient spatial-temporal-omics learning framework designed to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from fMRI for ASD classification. Our approach addresses these limitations by utilizing 3D time-domain derivatives as the spatial-temporal inter-voxel omics, which preserve full spatial resolution while capturing diverse statistical characteristics of the time series at each voxel. Meanwhile, functional connectivity features serve as the spatial-temporal inter-regional omics, capturing correlations across brain regions. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms previous methods while maintaining computational efficiency. We believe our research offers valuable insights that will inform and advance future ASD studies, particularly in the realm of spatial-temporal-omics-based learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning For Time Series Analysis With Application On Human Motion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19364v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data, defined by equally spaced points over time, is essential in fields like medicine, telecommunications, and energy. Analyzing it involves tasks such as classification, clustering, prototyping, and regression. Classification identifies normal vs. abnormal movements in skeleton-based motion sequences, clustering detects stock market behavior patterns, prototyping expands physical therapy datasets, and regression predicts patient recovery. Deep learning has recently gained traction in time series analysis due to its success in other domains. This thesis leverages deep learning to enhance classification with feature engineering, introduce foundation models, and develop a compact yet state-of-the-art architecture. We also address limited labeled data with self-supervised learning. Our contributions apply to real-world tasks, including human motion analysis for action recognition and rehabilitation. We introduce a generative model for human motion data, valuable for cinematic production and gaming. For prototyping, we propose a shape-based synthetic sample generation method to support regression models when data is scarce. Lastly, we critically evaluate discriminative and generative models, identifying limitations in current methodologies and advocating for a robust, standardized evaluation framework. Our experiments on public datasets provide novel insights and methodologies, advancing time series analysis with practical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy-Efficient Transformer Inference: Optimization Strategies for Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16627v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing computational demands of transformer models in time series classification necessitate effective optimization strategies for energy-efficient deployment. This paper presents a systematic investigation of optimization techniques, focusing on structured pruning and quantization methods for transformer architectures. Through extensive experimentation on three distinct datasets (RefrigerationDevices, ElectricDevices, and PLAID), we quantitatively evaluate model performance and energy efficiency across different transformer configurations. Our experimental results demonstrate that static quantization reduces energy consumption by 29.14% while maintaining classification performance, and L1 pruning achieves a 63% improvement in inference speed with minimal accuracy degradation. These findings provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of optimization strategies for transformer-based time series classification, establishing a foundation for efficient model deployment in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

This work combines the strengths of both to generate fast surrogate models with adjustable complexity reacting on time-varying inputs signals. By leveraging the VAE's dimensionality reduction using a nonhierarchical prior, our method adaptively assigns stochastic noise, naturally complementing known NeuralODE training enhancements and enabling probabilistic time series modeling. We show that standard Latent ODEs struggle with dimensionality reduction in systems with time-varying inputs. Our approach mitigates this by continuously propagating variational parameters through time, establishing fixed information channels in latent space. This results in a flexible and robust method that can learn different system complexities, e.g. deep neural networks or linear matrices. Hereby, it enables efficient approximation of the Koopman operator without the need for predefining its dimensionality. As our method balances dimensionality reduction and reconstruction accuracy, we call it Balanced Neural ODE (B-NODE). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this methods on several academic and real-world test cases, e.g. a power plant or MuJoCo data.</p></details> | <details><summary>confe...</summary><p>conference paper acctepd at ICLR 2025 Singapore</p></details> |

This study introduces an advanced methodology for supervised classification by integrating Functional Data Analysis (FDA) with tree-based ensemble techniques for classifying high-dimensional time series. The proposed framework, Enriched Functional Tree-Based Classifiers (EFTCs), leverages derivative and geometric features, benefiting from the diversity inherent in ensemble methods to further enhance predictive performance and reduce variance. While our approach has been tested on the enrichment of Functional Classification Trees (FCTs), Functional K-NN (FKNN), Functional Random Forest (FRF), Functional XGBoost (FXGB), and Functional LightGBM (FLGBM), it could be extended to other tree-based and non-tree-based classifiers, with appropriate considerations emerging from this investigation. Through extensive experimental evaluations on seven real-world datasets and six simulated scenarios, this proposal demonstrates fascinating improvements over traditional approaches, providing new insights into the application of FDA in complex, high-dimensional learning problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tail-robust factor modelling of vector and tensor time series in high dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09390v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of factor modelling vector- and tensor-valued time series in the presence of heavy tails in the data, which produce anomalous observations with non-negligible probability. For this, we propose to combine a two-step procedure for tensor data decomposition with data truncation, which is easy to implement and does not require an iterative search for a numerical solution. Departing away from the light-tail assumptions often adopted in the time series factor modelling literature, we derive the consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators while assuming the existence of the $(2 + 2\epsilon)$-th moment only for some $\epsilon \in (0, 1)$. Our rates explicitly depend on $\epsilon$ characterising the effect of heavy tails, and on the chosen level of truncation. We also propose a consistent criterion for determining the number of factors. Simulation studies and applications to two macroeconomic datasets demonstrate the good performance of the proposed estimators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Random Similarity Isolation Forests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19122v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With predictive models becoming prevalent, companies are expanding the types of data they gather. As a result, the collected datasets consist not only of simple numerical features but also more complex objects such as time series, images, or graphs. Such multi-modal data have the potential to improve performance in predictive tasks like outlier detection, where the goal is to identify objects deviating from the main data distribution. However, current outlier detection algorithms are dedicated to individual types of data. Consequently, working with mixed types of data requires either fusing multiple data-specific models or transforming all of the representations into a single format, both of which can hinder predictive performance. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal outlier detection algorithm called Random Similarity Isolation Forest. Our method combines the notions of isolation and similarity-based projection to handle datasets with mixtures of features of arbitrary data types. Experiments performed on 47 benchmark datasets demonstrate that Random Similarity Isolation Forest outperforms five state-of-the-art competitors. Our study shows that the use of multiple modalities can indeed improve the detection of anomalies and highlights the need for new outlier detection benchmarks tailored for multi-modal algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[EMERGE: Enhancing Multimodal Electronic Health Records Predictive Modeling with Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00036v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of multimodal Electronic Health Records (EHR) data has significantly advanced clinical predictive capabilities. Existing models, which utilize clinical notes and multivariate time-series EHR data, often fall short of incorporating the necessary medical context for accurate clinical tasks, while previous approaches with knowledge graphs (KGs) primarily focus on structured knowledge extraction. In response, we propose EMERGE, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) driven framework to enhance multimodal EHR predictive modeling. We extract entities from both time-series data and clinical notes by prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) and align them with professional PrimeKG, ensuring consistency. In addition to triplet relationships, we incorporate entities' definitions and descriptions for richer semantics. The extracted knowledge is then used to generate task-relevant summaries of patients' health statuses. Finally, we fuse the summary with other modalities using an adaptive multimodal fusion network with cross-attention. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets' in-hospital mortality and 30-day readmission tasks demonstrate the superior performance of the EMERGE framework over baseline models. Comprehensive ablation studies and analysis highlight the efficacy of each designed module and robustness to data sparsity. EMERGE contributes to refining the utilization of multimodal EHR data in healthcare, bridging the gap with nuanced medical contexts essential for informed clinical predictions. We have publicly released the code at https://github.com/yhzhu99/EMERGE.</p></details> | <details><summary>CIKM ...</summary><p>CIKM 2024 Full Research Paper; arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2402.07016</p></details> |
| **[A HEART for the environment: Transformer-Based Spatiotemporal Modeling for Air Quality Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19042v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and reliable air pollution forecasting is crucial for effective environmental management and policy-making. llull-environment is a sophisticated and scalable forecasting system for air pollution, inspired by previous models currently operational in Madrid and Valladolid (Spain). It contains (among other key components) an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network to forecast mean pollution levels for four key pollutants (NO$_2$, O$_3$, PM$_{10}$, PM$_{2.5}$) using historical data, external forecasts, and other contextual features. This paper investigates the augmentation of this neural network with an attention mechanism to improve predictive accuracy. The proposed attention mechanism pre-processes tensors containing the input features before passing them to the existing mean forecasting model. The resulting model is a combination of several architectures and ideas and can be described as a "Hybrid Enhanced Autoregressive Transformer", or HEART. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated by comparing the mean square error (MSE) across different attention layouts against the system without such a mechanism. We observe a significant reduction in MSE of up to 22%, with an average of 7.5% across tested cities and pollutants. The performance of a given attention mechanism turns out to depend on the pollutant, highlighting the differences in their creation and dissipation processes. Our findings are not restricted to optimizing air quality prediction models, but are applicable generally to (fixed length) time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeKAN: KAN-based Frequency Decomposition Learning Architecture for Long-term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06910v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world time series often have multiple frequency components that are intertwined with each other, making accurate time series forecasting challenging. Decomposing the mixed frequency components into multiple single frequency components is a natural choice. However, the information density of patterns varies across different frequencies, and employing a uniform modeling approach for different frequency components can lead to inaccurate characterization. To address this challenges, inspired by the flexibility of the recent Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), we propose a KAN-based Frequency Decomposition Learning architecture (TimeKAN) to address the complex forecasting challenges caused by multiple frequency mixtures. Specifically, TimeKAN mainly consists of three components: Cascaded Frequency Decomposition (CFD) blocks, Multi-order KAN Representation Learning (M-KAN) blocks and Frequency Mixing blocks. CFD blocks adopt a bottom-up cascading approach to obtain series representations for each frequency band. Benefiting from the high flexibility of KAN, we design a novel M-KAN block to learn and represent specific temporal patterns within each frequency band. Finally, Frequency Mixing blocks is used to recombine the frequency bands into the original format. Extensive experimental results across multiple real-world time series datasets demonstrate that TimeKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance as an extremely lightweight architecture.

Not surprisingly, this area has attracted considerable attention from researchers, who have proposed a wide range of methods based on various backbones. However, the evaluation of the area often exhibits three systemic limitations: 1. Failure to account for the full spectrum of stock movement patterns observed in dynamic financial markets. (Diversity Gap), 2. The absence of unified assessment protocols undermines the validity of cross-study performance comparisons. (Standardization Deficit), and 3. Neglect of critical market structure factors, resulting in inflated performance metrics that lack practical applicability. (Real-World Mismatch). Addressing these limitations, we propose FinTSB, a comprehensive and practical benchmark for financial time series forecasting (FinTSF). To increase the variety, we categorize movement patterns into four specific parts, tokenize and pre-process the data, and assess the data quality based on some sequence characteristics. To eliminate biases due to different evaluation settings, we standardize the metrics across three dimensions and build a user-friendly, lightweight pipeline incorporating methods from various backbones. To accurately simulate real-world trading scenarios and facilitate practical implementation, we extensively model various regulatory constraints, including transaction fees, among others. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on FinTSB, highlighting key insights to guide model selection under varying market conditions. Overall, FinTSB provides researchers with a novel and comprehensive platform for improving and evaluating FinTSF methods.

However, this estimator often suffers from high variance and scalability concerns. To address these challenges, we investigate Hutch++, an optimal stochastic trace estimator for generative models, designed to minimize training variance while maintaining transport optimality. Hutch++ is particularly effective for handling ill-conditioned matrices with large condition numbers, which commonly arise when high-dimensional data exhibits a low-dimensional structure. To mitigate the need for frequent and costly QR decompositions, we propose practical schemes that balance frequency and accuracy, backed by theoretical guarantees. Our analysis demonstrates that Hutch++ leads to generations of higher quality. Furthermore, this method exhibits effective variance reduction in various applications, including simulations, conditional time series forecasts, and image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AISTATS 2025</p></details> |

Traditional Gaussian-based models fail to capture these bounds, requiring more flexible approaches. This paper introduces the Matsuoka Autoregressive Moving Average (MARMA) model, extending the GARMA framework by assuming a Matsuoka-distributed random component taking values in (0,1) and an ARMA-like systematic structure allowing for random time-dependent covariates. Parameter estimation is performed via partial maximum likelihood (PMLE), for which we present the asymptotic theory. It enables statistical inference, including confidence intervals and model selection. To construct prediction intervals, we propose a novel bootstrap-based method that accounts for dependence structure uncertainty. A comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation study assesses the finite sample performance of the proposed methodologies, while an application to forecasting the useful water volume of the Guarapiranga Reservoir in Brazil showcases their practical usefulness.</p></details> |  |

Recent works have introduced innovative architectures for time series models, such as the Time-Series Mixer (TSMixer), which leverages multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to enhance prediction accuracy by effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dependencies within the data. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for time-series forecasting by modifying TSMixer with a KAN layer (TSKANMixer). Experimental results demonstrate that TSKANMixer tends to improve prediction accuracy over the original TSMixer across multiple datasets, ranking among the top-performing models compared to other time series approaches. Our results show that the KANs are promising alternatives to improve the performance of time series forecasting by replacing or extending traditional MLPs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 7 tables and accepted at the AI4TS: AI for Time Series Analysis workshop, AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Existing interpretation methods are limited by focusing mostly on classification tasks, evaluating using custom baseline models instead of the latest time series models, using simple synthetic datasets, and requiring training another model. We introduce a novel interpretation method, \textit{Windowed Temporal Saliency Rescaling (WinTSR)} addressing these limitations. WinTSR explicitly captures temporal dependencies among the past time steps and efficiently scales the feature importance with this time importance. We benchmark WinTSR against 10 recent interpretation techniques with 5 state-of-the-art deep-learning models of different architectures, including a time series foundation model. We use 3 real-world datasets for both time-series classification and regression. Our comprehensive analysis shows that WinTSR significantly outperforms other local interpretation methods in overall performance. Finally, we provide a novel, open-source framework to interpret the latest time series transformers and foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 14 figures, GitHub https://github.com/khairulislam/Timeseries-Explained</p></details> |

Our model decomposes such data into two distinct components: a low-dimensional predictable factor component and an unpredictable error term. These components are identified through the autocovariance structure of the underlying functional time series. The model parameters are consistently estimated using the eigencomponents of a cumulative autocovariance operator and an information criterion is proposed to determine the appropriate number of factors. Applications to mortality and yield curve modeling illustrate key advantages of our approach over the widely used functional principal component analysis, as it offers parsimonious structural representations of the underlying dynamics along with gains in out-of-sample forecast performance.</p></details> |  |

This research presents a novel framework that integrates Time Series ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models with a proprietary formula specifically designed to calculate bad goods after time series forecasting. By leveraging historical data patterns, including sales, returns, and capacity, the model forecasts potential quality failures, enabling proactive decision-making. ARIMA is employed to capture temporal trends in time series data, while the newly developed formula quantifies the likelihood and impact of defects with greater precision. Experimental results, validated on a dataset spanning 2022-2024 for Organic Beer-G 1 Liter, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional statistical models, such as Exponential Smoothing and Holt-Winters, in both prediction accuracy and risk evaluation. This study advances the field of predictive analytics by bridging time series forecasting, ARIMA, and risk management in supply chain quality control, offering a scalable and practical solution for minimizing losses due to bad goods.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoCas: Autoregressive Cascade Predictor in Social Networks via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18040v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Popularity prediction in information cascades plays a crucial role in social computing, with broad applications in viral marketing, misinformation control, and content recommendation. However, information propagation mechanisms, user behavior, and temporal activity patterns exhibit significant diversity, necessitating a foundational model capable of adapting to such variations. At the same time, the amount of available cascade data remains relatively limited compared to the vast datasets used for training large language models (LLMs). Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of leveraging LLMs for time-series prediction by exploiting commonalities across different time-series domains. Building on this insight, we introduce the Autoregressive Information Cascade Predictor (AutoCas), an LLM-enhanced model designed specifically for cascade popularity prediction. Unlike natural language sequences, cascade data is characterized by complex local topologies, diffusion contexts, and evolving dynamics, requiring specialized adaptations for effective LLM integration. To address these challenges, we first tokenize cascade data to align it with sequence modeling principles. Next, we reformulate cascade diffusion as an autoregressive modeling task to fully harness the architectural strengths of LLMs. Beyond conventional approaches, we further introduce prompt learning to enhance the synergy between LLMs and cascade prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AutoCas significantly outperforms baseline models in cascade popularity prediction while exhibiting scaling behavior inherited from LLMs. Code is available at this repository: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AutoCas-85C6</p></details> | 12 pages |

The answer lies in the concept of \rnthm{} theorem, a fundamental concept in measure theory. The key insight is -- Multiplying the vanilla loss function with the \rnthm{} derivative improves the performance across the board. We refer to this as RN-Loss. This is established using PAC learnability of anomaly detection. We further show that the \rnthm{} derivative offers important insights into unsupervised clustering based anomaly detections as well. We evaluate our algorithm on 96 datasets, including univariate and multivariate data from diverse domains, including healthcare, cybersecurity, and finance.

| **[Techniques for Enhancing Memory Capacity of Reservoir Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17923v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir Computing (RC) is a bio-inspired machine learning framework, and various models have been proposed. RC is a well-suited model for time series data processing, but there is a trade-off between memory capacity and nonlinearity. In this study, we propose methods to improve the memory capacity of reservoir models by modifying their network configuration except for the inside of reservoirs. The Delay method retains past inputs by adding delay node chains to the input layer with the specified number of delay steps. To suppress the effect of input value increase due to the Delay method, we divide the input weights by the number of added delay steps. The Pass through method feeds input values directly to the output layer. The Clustering method divides the input and reservoir nodes into multiple parts and integrates them at the output layer. We applied these methods to an echo state network (ESN), a typical RC model, and the chaotic Boltzmann machine (CBM)-RC, which can be efficiently implemented in integrated circuits. We evaluated their performance on the NARMA task, and measured information processing capacity (IPC) to evaluate the trade-off between memory capacity and nonlinearity.</p></details> |  |
| **[LiNo: Advancing Recursive Residual Decomposition of Linear and Nonlinear Patterns for Robust Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17159v4)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting models are pivotal in a data-driven world with vast volumes of time series data that appear as a compound of vast Linear and Nonlinear patterns. Recent deep time series forecasting models struggle to utilize seasonal and trend decomposition to separate the entangled components. Such a strategy only explicitly extracts simple linear patterns like trends, leaving the other linear modes and vast unexplored nonlinear patterns to the residual. Their flawed linear and nonlinear feature extraction models and shallow-level decomposition limit their adaptation to the diverse patterns present in real-world scenarios. Given this, we innovate Recursive Residual Decomposition by introducing explicit extraction of both linear and nonlinear patterns. This deeper-level decomposition framework, which is named LiNo, captures linear patterns using a Li block which can be a moving average kernel, and models nonlinear patterns using a No block which can be a Transformer encoder. The extraction of these two patterns is performed alternatively and recursively. To achieve the full potential of LiNo, we develop the current simple linear pattern extractor to a general learnable autoregressive model, and design a novel No block that can handle all essential nonlinear patterns. Remarkably, the proposed LiNo achieves state-of-the-art on thirteen real-world benchmarks under univariate and multivariate forecasting scenarios. Experiments show that current forecasting models can deliver more robust and precise results through this advanced Recursive Residual Decomposition. We hope this work could offer insight into designing more effective forecasting models. Code is available at this Repository: https://github.com/Levi-Ackman/LiNo.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Can Multimodal LLMs Perform Time Series Anomaly Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17812v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used in time series analysis. However, the potential of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), particularly vision-language models, for time series remains largely under-explored. One natural way for humans to detect time series anomalies is through visualization and textual description. Motivated by this, we raise a critical and practical research question: Can multimodal LLMs perform time series anomaly detection? To answer this, we propose VisualTimeAnomaly benchmark to evaluate MLLMs in time series anomaly detection (TSAD). Our approach transforms time series numerical data into the image format and feed these images into various MLLMs, including proprietary models (GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5) and open-source models (LLaVA-NeXT and Qwen2-VL), each with one larger and one smaller variant. In total, VisualTimeAnomaly contains 12.4k time series images spanning 3 scenarios and 3 anomaly granularities with 9 anomaly types across 8 MLLMs. Starting with the univariate case (point- and range-wise anomalies), we extend our evaluation to more practical scenarios, including multivariate and irregular time series scenarios, and variate-wise anomalies. Our study reveals several key insights: 1) MLLMs detect range- and variate-wise anomalies more effectively than point-wise anomalies. 2) MLLMs are highly robust to irregular time series, even with 25% of the data missing. 3) Open-source MLLMs perform comparably to proprietary models in TSAD. While open-source MLLMs excel on univariate time series, proprietary MLLMs demonstrate superior effectiveness on multivariate time series.

While the recently introduced sLSTM for Natural Language Processing (NLP) introduces exponential gating and memory mixing that are beneficial for long term sequential learning, its potential short memory issue is a barrier to applying sLSTM directly in TSF. To address this, we propose a simple yet efficient algorithm named P-sLSTM, which is built upon sLSTM by incorporating patching and channel independence. These modifications substantially enhance sLSTM's performance in TSF, achieving state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, we provide theoretical justifications for our design, and conduct extensive comparative and analytical experiments to fully validate the efficiency and superior performance of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2025)</p></details> |

The popular methods based on assuming the sparse error covariance matrix after taking out common factors may be invalid for many financial applications. Our formulation postulates a latent model-based error cluster structure after removing observable factors, which not only leads to more interpretable cluster patterns but also accounts for non-sparse cross-sectional correlations among the variable-specific residuals. Our method begins with using least-squares to estimate the factor loadings, followed by identifying the latent cluster structure by thresholding the scaled covariance difference measures of residuals. A novel ratio-based criterion is introduced to determine the threshold parameter when performing the developed clustering algorithm. We then establish the cluster recovery consistency of our method and derive the convergence rates of our proposed covariance matrix estimators under different norms. Finally, we demonstrate the superior finite sample performance of our proposal over the competing methods through both extensive simulations and a real data application on minimum variance portfolio.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have corrected some inaccurate descriptions</p></details> |

Diffusion models have emerged as superior alternatives to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) by addressing their limitations, such as training instability, mode collapse, and poor representation of multimodal distributions. This success has spurred widespread research interest. In the domain of tabular data, diffusion models have begun to showcase similar advantages over GANs and VAEs, achieving significant performance breakthroughs and demonstrating their potential for addressing unique challenges in tabular data modeling. However, while domains like images and time series have numerous surveys summarizing advancements in diffusion models, there remains a notable gap in the literature for tabular data. Despite the increasing interest in diffusion models for tabular data, there has been little effort to systematically review and summarize these developments. This lack of a dedicated survey limits a clear understanding of the challenges, progress, and future directions in this critical area. This survey addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of diffusion models for tabular data. Covering works from June 2015, when diffusion models emerged, to December 2024, we analyze nearly all relevant studies, with updates maintained in a \href{https://github.com/Diffusion-Model-Leiden/awesome-diffusion-models-for-tabular-data}{GitHub repository}. Assuming readers possess foundational knowledge of statistics and diffusion models, we employ mathematical formulations to deliver a rigorous and detailed review, aiming to promote developments in this emerging and exciting area.</p></details> |  |

The Rocket algorithm has emerged as a simple yet powerful method, achieving state-of-the-art performance through random convolutional kernels applied to time-series data, followed by non-linear transformation. Its architecture approximates a one-hidden-layer convolutional neural network while eliminating parameter training, ensuring computational efficiency. Despite its empirical success, fundamental questions about its theoretical foundations remain unexplored. We bridge theory and practice by formalizing Rocket's random convolutional filters within the compressed sensing framework, proving that random projections preserve discriminative patterns in time-series data. This analysis reveals relationships between kernel parameters and input signal characteristics, enabling more principled approaches to algorithm configuration. Moreover, we demonstrate that its non-linearity, based on the proportion of positive values after convolutions, expresses the inherent sparsity of time-series data. Our theoretical investigation also proves that Rocket satisfies two critical conditions: translation invariance and noise robustness. These findings enhance interpretability and provide guidance for parameter optimization in extreme cases, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical application of time-series classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[TabulaTime: A Novel Multimodal Deep Learning Framework for Advancing Acute Coronary Syndrome Prediction through Environmental and Clinical Data Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17049v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS), including ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (NSTEMI), remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Traditional cardiovascular risk scores rely primarily on clinical data, often overlooking environmental influences like air pollution that significantly impact heart health. Moreover, integrating complex time-series environmental data with clinical records is challenging. We introduce TabulaTime, a multimodal deep learning framework that enhances ACS risk prediction by combining clinical risk factors with air pollution data. TabulaTime features three key innovations: First, it integrates time-series air pollution data with clinical tabular data to improve prediction accuracy. Second, its PatchRWKV module automatically extracts complex temporal patterns, overcoming limitations of traditional feature engineering while maintaining linear computational complexity. Third, attention mechanisms enhance interpretability by revealing interactions between clinical and environmental factors. Experimental results show that TabulaTime improves prediction accuracy by over 20% compared to conventional models such as CatBoost, Random Forest, and LightGBM, with air pollution data alone contributing over a 10% improvement. Feature importance analysis identifies critical predictors including previous angina, systolic blood pressure, PM10, and NO2. Overall, TabulaTime bridges clinical and environmental insights, supporting personalized prevention strategies and informing public health policies to mitigate ACS risk.</p></details> |  |
| **[Class-Dependent Perturbation Effects in Evaluating Time Series Attributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17022v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As machine learning models become increasingly prevalent in time series applications, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods are essential for understanding their predictions. Within XAI, feature attribution methods aim to identify which input features contributed the most to a model's prediction, with their evaluation typically relying on perturbation-based metrics. Through empirical analysis across multiple datasets, model architectures, and perturbation strategies, we identify important class-dependent effects in these metrics: they show varying effectiveness across classes, achieving strong results for some while remaining less sensitive to others. In particular, we find that the most effective perturbation strategies often demonstrate the most pronounced class differences. Our analysis suggests that these effects arise from the learned biases of classifiers, indicating that perturbation-based evaluation may reflect specific model behaviors rather than intrinsic attribution quality. We propose an evaluation framework with a class-aware penalty term to help assess and account for these effects in evaluating feature attributions. Although our analysis focuses on time series classification, these class-dependent effects likely extend to other structured data domains where perturbation-based evaluation is common.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-shot Load Forecasting for Integrated Energy Systems: A Large Language Model-based Framework with Multi-task Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16896v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing penetration of renewable energy sources in power systems has increased the complexity and uncertainty of load forecasting, especially for integrated energy systems with multiple energy carriers. Traditional forecasting methods heavily rely on historical data and exhibit limited transferability across different scenarios, posing significant challenges for emerging applications in smart grids and energy internet. This paper proposes the TSLLM-Load Forecasting Mechanism, a novel zero-shot load forecasting framework based on large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges. The framework consists of three key components: a data preprocessing module that handles multi-source energy load data, a time series prompt generation module that bridges the semantic gap between energy data and LLMs through multi-task learning and similarity alignment, and a prediction module that leverages pre-trained LLMs for accurate forecasting. The framework's effectiveness was validated on a real-world dataset comprising load profiles from 20 Australian solar-powered households, demonstrating superior performance in both conventional and zero-shot scenarios. In conventional testing, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.4163 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.3760, outperforming existing approaches by at least 8\%. In zero-shot prediction experiments across 19 households, the framework maintained consistent accuracy with a total MSE of 11.2712 and MAE of 7.6709, showing at least 12\% improvement over current methods. The results validate the framework's potential for accurate and transferable load forecasting in integrated energy systems, particularly beneficial for renewable energy integration and smart grid applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[A dynamic copula model for probabilistic forecasting of non-Gaussian multivariate time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16874v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) data often include a heterogeneous mix of non-Gaussian distributional features (asymmetry, multimodality, heavy tails) and data types (continuous and discrete variables). Traditional MTS methods based on convenient parametric distributions are typically ill-equipped to model this heterogeneity. Copula models provide an appealing alternative, but present significant obstacles for fully Bayesian inference and probabilistic forecasting. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel and general strategy for posterior approximation in MTS copula models and apply it to a Gaussian copula built from a dynamic factor model. This framework provides scalable, fully Bayesian inference for cross-sectional and serial dependencies and nonparametrically learns heterogeneous marginal distributions. We validate this approach by establishing posterior consistency and confirm excellent finite-sample performance even under model misspecification using simulated data. We apply our method to crime count and macroeconomic MTS data and find superior probabilistic forecasting performance compared to popular MTS models. These results demonstrate that the proposed method is a versatile, general-purpose utility for probabilistic forecasting of MTS that works well across of range of applications with minimal user input.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Existing deep learning methods struggle to address two core issues of rPPG simultaneously: understanding the periodic pattern of rPPG among long contexts and addressing large spatiotemporal redundancy in video segments. These represent a trade-off between computational complexity and the ability to capture long-range dependencies. In this paper, we introduce RhythmMamba, a state space model-based method that captures long-range dependencies while maintaining linear complexity. By viewing rPPG as a time series task through the proposed frame stem, the periodic variations in pulse waves are modeled as state transitions. Additionally, we design multi-temporal constraint and frequency domain feed-forward, both aligned with the characteristics of rPPG time series, to improve the learning capacity of Mamba for rPPG signals. Extensive experiments show that RhythmMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance with 319% throughput and 23% peak GPU memory.

However, existing local trajectory planning methods have difficulty planning trajectories with optimal velocity profiles at racetracks with sharp corners, thus weakening the performance of autonomous racing. To address this problem, we propose a local trajectory planning method that integrates Velocity Prediction based on Model Predictive Contouring Control (VPMPCC). The optimal parameters of VPMPCC are learned through Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on a proposed novel Objective Function adapted to Racing (OFR). Specifically, VPMPCC achieves velocity prediction by encoding the racetrack as a reference velocity profile and incorporating it into the optimization problem. This method optimizes the velocity profile of local trajectories, especially at corners with significant curvature. The proposed OFR balances racing performance with vehicle safety, ensuring safe and efficient BO training. In the simulation, the number of training iterations for OFR-based BO is reduced by 42.86% compared to the state-of-the-art method. The optimal simulation-trained parameters are then applied to a real-world F1TENTH vehicle without retraining. During prolonged racing on a custom-built racetrack featuring significant sharp corners, the mean projected velocity of VPMPCC reaches 93.18% of the vehicle's handling limits. The released code is available at https://github.com/zhouhengli/VPMPCC.</p></details> |  |
| **[GDTS: Goal-Guided Diffusion Model with Tree Sampling for Multi-Modal Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14922v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of pedestrian trajectories is crucial for improving the safety of autonomous driving. However, this task is generally nontrivial due to the inherent stochasticity of human motion, which naturally requires the predictor to generate multi-modal prediction. Previous works leverage various generative methods, such as GAN and VAE, for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Nevertheless, these methods may suffer from mode collapse and relatively low-quality results. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has recently been applied to trajectory prediction due to its simple training process and powerful reconstruction ability. However, current diffusion-based methods do not fully utilize input information and usually require many denoising iterations that lead to a long inference time or an additional network for initialization. To address these challenges and facilitate the use of diffusion models in multi-modal trajectory prediction, we propose GDTS, a novel Goal-Guided Diffusion Model with Tree Sampling for multi-modal trajectory prediction. Considering the "goal-driven" characteristics of human motion, GDTS leverages goal estimation to guide the generation of the diffusion network. A two-stage tree sampling algorithm is presented, which leverages common features to reduce the inference time and improve accuracy for multi-modal prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance with real-time inference speed in public datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Learn Weight Generation via Trajectory Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01117v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based algorithms have emerged as promising techniques for weight generation, particularly in scenarios like multi-task learning that require frequent weight updates. However, existing solutions suffer from limited cross-task transferability. In addition, they only utilize optimal weights as training samples, ignoring the value of other weights in the optimization process. To address these issues, we propose Lt-Di, which integrates the diffusion algorithm with meta-learning to generate weights for unseen tasks. Furthermore, we extend the vanilla diffusion algorithm into a trajectory diffusion algorithm to utilize other weights along the optimization trajectory. Trajectory diffusion decomposes the entire diffusion chain into multiple shorter ones, improving training and inference efficiency. We analyze the convergence properties of the weight generation paradigm and improve convergence efficiency without additional time overhead. Our experiments demonstrate Lt-Di's higher accuracy while reducing computational overhead across various tasks, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, multi-domain generalization, and large-scale language model fine-tuning.Our code is released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Lt-Di-0E51.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Finite-Time Sliding Mode Control for Chattering-Free Trajectory Tracking of Robotic Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16867v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving precise and efficient trajectory tracking in robotic arms remains a key challenge due to system uncertainties and chattering effects in conventional sliding mode control (SMC). This paper presents a chattering-free fast terminal sliding mode control (FTSMC) strategy for a three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) robotic arm, designed to enhance tracking accuracy and robustness while ensuring finite-time convergence. The control framework is developed using Newton-Euler dynamics, followed by a state-space representation that captures the system's angular position and velocity. By incorporating an improved sliding surface and a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, the proposed FTSMC effectively mitigates chattering while preserving the advantages of SMC, such as fast response and strong disturbance rejection. The controller's performance is rigorously evaluated through comparisons with conventional PD sliding mode control (PDSMC) and terminal sliding mode control (TSMC). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior trajectory tracking performance, faster convergence, and enhanced stability compared to existing methods, making it a promising solution for high-precision robotic applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[ET-SEED: Efficient Trajectory-Level SE(3) Equivariant Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03990v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning, e.g., diffusion policy, has been proven effective in various robotic manipulation tasks. However, extensive demonstrations are required for policy robustness and generalization. To reduce the demonstration reliance, we leverage spatial symmetry and propose ET-SEED, an efficient trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion model for generating action sequences in complex robot manipulation tasks. Further, previous equivariant diffusion models require the per-step equivariance in the Markov process, making it difficult to learn policy under such strong constraints. We theoretically extend equivariant Markov kernels and simplify the condition of equivariant diffusion process, thereby significantly improving training efficiency for trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion policy in an end-to-end manner. We evaluate ET-SEED on representative robotic manipulation tasks, involving rigid body, articulated and deformable object. Experiments demonstrate superior data efficiency and manipulation proficiency of our proposed method, as well as its ability to generalize to unseen configurations with only a few demonstrations.

In this paper, we present a solution for this problem using a novel drag-aware model formulation which is coupled with MPC, and therefore, enables tracking and landing during high-speed curvilinear trajectories of an USV without any communication. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our approach yields 40% decrease in prediction errors, and provides a 3-fold increase in certainty of predictions. Consequently, this leads to a 30% improvement in tracking performance and 40% higher success in landing on a moving USV even during aggressive turns that are unfeasible for conventional marine missions. We test our approach in two different real-world scenarios with marine vessels of two different sizes and further solidify our results through statistical analysis in simulation to demonstrate the robustness of our method.</p></details> |  |

To ensure safety, planners require reliable uncertainty estimates of the predicted behavior of surrounding agents, yet this aspect has received limited attention. In particular, decomposing uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic components is essential for distinguishing between inherent environmental randomness and model uncertainty, thereby enabling more robust and informed decision-making. This paper addresses the challenge of uncertainty modeling in trajectory prediction with a holistic approach that emphasizes uncertainty quantification, decomposition, and the impact of model composition. Our method, grounded in information theory, provides a theoretically principled way to measure uncertainty and decompose it into aleatoric and epistemic components. Unlike prior work, our approach is compatible with state-of-the-art motion predictors, allowing for broader applicability. We demonstrate its utility by conducting extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset, which shows how different architectures and configurations influence uncertainty quantification and model robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, submitted to International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> |

Supervised deep learning methods provide accurate road segmentation in the domain of their training data but cannot be trusted in out-of-distribution scenarios. Including the whole distribution in the trainset is challenging as each sample must be labeled by hand. Trajectory-based self-supervised methods offer a potential solution as they can learn from the traversed route without manual labels. However, existing trajectory-based methods use learning schemes that rely only on the camera or only on the lidar. In this paper, trajectory-based learning is implemented jointly with lidar and camera for increased performance.

Previous studies aim to predict gaze trajectories when humans are free-viewing an image, searching for required targets, or looking for clues to answer questions in an image. While these tasks focus on visual-centric scenarios, humans move their gaze also along with audio signal inputs in more common scenarios. To fill this gap, we introduce a new task that predicts human gaze trajectories in a visual scene with synchronized audio inputs and provide a new dataset containing 20k gaze points from 8 subjects. To effectively integrate audio information and simulate the dynamic process of human gaze motion, we propose a novel learning framework called EyEar (Eye moving while Ear listening) based on physics-informed dynamics, which considers three key factors to predict gazes: eye inherent motion tendency, vision salient attraction, and audio semantic attraction. We also propose a probability density score to overcome the high individual variability of gaze trajectories, thereby improving the stabilization of optimization and the reliability of the evaluation. Experimental results show that EyEar outperforms all the baselines in the context of all evaluation metrics, thanks to the proposed components in the learning model.</p></details> |  |

Starting with a small number of embodiment-flexible human demonstrations collected in a virtual reality simulation environment, the pipeline refines these demonstrations using optimization-based kinematic retargeting and trajectory optimization to adapt them across various robot embodiments and physical parameters. This process yields a diverse, physically consistent dataset that enables cross-embodiment data transfer, and offers the potential to reuse legacy datasets collected under different hardware configurations or physical parameters. We validate the pipeline's effectiveness by training diffusion policies from the generated datasets for challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks across multiple robot embodiments, including a floating Allegro hand and bimanual robot arms. The trained policies are deployed zero-shot on hardware for bimanual iiwa arms, achieving high success rates with minimal human input.

This paper introduces the Trajectory-to-Action Pipeline (TAP), a scalable and automated method for extracting SDL labels from large trajectory datasets. TAP applies a rules-based cross-entropy optimization approach to learn parameters directly from data, enhancing generalization across diverse driving contexts. Using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), TAP achieves 30% greater precision than Average Displacement Error (ADE) and 24% over Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in identifying behaviorally similar trajectories. Additionally, TAP enables automated detection of unique driving behaviors, streamlining safety evaluation processes for AV testing.

However, the inherently dynamic nature of the heart imposes strict limits on acquisition times, making high-resolution T1 mapping a persistent challenge. Compressed sensing (CS) approaches have reduced scan durations by undersampling k-space and reconstructing images from partial data, and recent studies show that jointly optimizing the undersampling patterns with the reconstruction network can substantially improve performance. Still, most current T1 mapping pipelines rely on static, hand-crafted masks that do not exploit the full acceleration and accuracy potential. In this work, we introduce T1-PILOT: an end-to-end method that explicitly incorporates the T1 signal relaxation model into the sampling-reconstruction framework to guide the learning of non-Cartesian trajectories, crossframe alignment, and T1 decay estimation. Through extensive experiments on the CMRxRecon dataset, T1-PILOT significantly outperforms several baseline strategies (including learned single-mask and fixed radial or golden-angle sampling schemes), achieving higher T1 map fidelity at greater acceleration factors. In particular, we observe consistent gains in PSNR and VIF relative to existing methods, along with marked improvements in delineating finer myocardial structures. Our results highlight that optimizing sampling trajectories in tandem with the physical relaxation model leads to both enhanced quantitative accuracy and reduced acquisition times. Code for reproducing all results will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minds on the Move: Decoding Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Driving with Cognitive Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20084v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In mixed autonomous driving environments, accurately predicting the future trajectories of surrounding vehicles is crucial for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In driving scenarios, a vehicle's trajectory is determined by the decision-making process of human drivers. However, existing models primarily focus on the inherent statistical patterns in the data, often neglecting the critical aspect of understanding the decision-making processes of human drivers. This oversight results in models that fail to capture the true intentions of human drivers, leading to suboptimal performance in long-term trajectory prediction. To address this limitation, we introduce a Cognitive-Informed Transformer (CITF) that incorporates a cognitive concept, Perceived Safety, to interpret drivers' decision-making mechanisms. Perceived Safety encapsulates the varying risk tolerances across drivers with different driving behaviors. Specifically, we develop a Perceived Safety-aware Module that includes a Quantitative Safety Assessment for measuring the subject risk levels within scenarios, and Driver Behavior Profiling for characterizing driver behaviors. Furthermore, we present a novel module, Leanformer, designed to capture social interactions among vehicles. CITF demonstrates significant performance improvements on three well-established datasets. In terms of long-term prediction, it surpasses existing benchmarks by 12.0% on the NGSIM, 28.2% on the HighD, and 20.8% on the MoCAD dataset.

| **[CarPlanner: Consistent Auto-regressive Trajectory Planning for Large-scale Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19908v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning is vital for autonomous driving, ensuring safe and efficient navigation in complex environments. While recent learning-based methods, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in specific scenarios, RL planners struggle with training inefficiencies and managing large-scale, real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CarPlanner}, a \textbf{C}onsistent \textbf{a}uto-\textbf{r}egressive \textbf{Planner} that uses RL to generate multi-modal trajectories. The auto-regressive structure enables efficient large-scale RL training, while the incorporation of consistency ensures stable policy learning by maintaining coherent temporal consistency across time steps. Moreover, CarPlanner employs a generation-selection framework with an expert-guided reward function and an invariant-view module, simplifying RL training and enhancing policy performance. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our proposed RL framework effectively addresses the challenges of training efficiency and performance enhancement, positioning CarPlanner as a promising solution for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that the RL-based planner can surpass both IL- and rule-based state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on the challenging large-scale real-world dataset nuPlan. Our proposed CarPlanner surpasses RL-, IL-, and rule-based SOTA approaches within this demanding dataset.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Tracailer: An Efficient Trajectory Planner for Tractor-Trailer Vehicles in Unstructured Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19832v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tractor-trailer vehicle (robot) consists of a drivable tractor and one or more non-drivable trailers connected via hitches. Compared to typical car-like robots, the addition of trailers provides greater transportation capability. However, this also complicates motion planning due to the robot's complex kinematics, high-dimensional state space, and deformable structure. To efficiently plan safe, time-optimal trajectories that adhere to the kinematic constraints of the robot and address the challenges posed by its unique features, this paper introduces a lightweight, compact, and high-order smooth trajectory representation for tractor-trailer robots. Based on it, we design an efficiently solvable spatio-temporal trajectory optimization problem. To deal with deformable structures, which leads to difficulties in collision avoidance, we fully leverage the collision-free regions of the environment, directly applying deformations to trajectories in continuous space. This approach not requires constructing safe regions from the environment using convex approximations through collision-free seed points before each optimization, avoiding the loss of the solution space, thus reducing the dependency of the optimization on initial values. Moreover, a multi-terminal fast path search algorithm is proposed to generate the initial values for optimization. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves several-fold improvements in efficiency compared to existing algorithms, while also ensuring lower curvature and trajectory duration. Real-world experiments involving the transportation, loading and unloading of goods in both indoor and outdoor scenarios further validate the effectiveness of our method.

In this paper, a large signal model of the grid-connected VSG is first established. The trajectory reversing method (TRM) is then introduced to estimate the domain of attraction (DOA) of VSG. Subsequently, the transient instability mechanism is revealed in detail based on the estimated DOA boundary. The impacts of system parameters on the DOA range are further investigated. It is found that loss of synchronization (LOS) occurs if the system trajectory lies outside the post-fault DOA range. In scenarios where no equilibrium points exist after a grid fault, system stability can be reestablished only when the fault clearing angle (FCA) does not exceed the critical clearing angle (CCA). Finally, the CCA derived from the DOA and that from the conventional equal area criteria (EAC) are compared. The results show that CCA obtained by our solution has a higher accuracy. Time-domain simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed transient stability analysis method of grid-connected VSG.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,11 figures, references added</p></details> |

Reconstructing a point's 3D motion just from the images captured by only a monocular camera is unfeasible without prior assumptions. Under limited observation conditions such as insufficient observations, long distance, and high observation error of platform, the least squares estimation faces the issue of ill-conditioning. This paper presents an algorithm for reconstructing 3D trajectories of moving points using a monocular camera. The motion of the points is represented through temporal polynomials. Ridge estimation is introduced to mitigate the issues of ill-conditioning caused by limited observation conditions. Then, an automatic algorithm for determining the order of the temporal polynomials is proposed. Furthermore, the definition of reconstructability for temporal polynomials is proposed to describe the reconstruction accuracy quantitatively. The simulated and real-world experimental results demonstrate the feasibility, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sports-Traj: A Unified Trajectory Generation Model for Multi-Agent Movement in Sports](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17680v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding multi-agent movement is critical across various fields. The conventional approaches typically focus on separate tasks such as trajectory prediction, imputation, or spatial-temporal recovery. Considering the unique formulation and constraint of each task, most existing methods are tailored for only one, limiting the ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, which is a common requirement in real-world scenarios. Another limitation is that widely used public datasets mainly focus on pedestrian movements with casual, loosely connected patterns, where interactions between individuals are not always present, especially at a long distance, making them less representative of more structured environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Unified Trajectory Generation model, UniTraj, that processes arbitrary trajectories as masked inputs, adaptable to diverse scenarios in the domain of sports games. Specifically, we introduce a Ghost Spatial Masking (GSM) module, embedded within a Transformer encoder, for spatial feature extraction. We further extend recent State Space Models (SSMs), known as the Mamba model, into a Bidirectional Temporal Mamba (BTM) to better capture temporal dependencies. Additionally, we incorporate a Bidirectional Temporal Scaled (BTS) module to thoroughly scan trajectories while preserving temporal missing relationships. Furthermore, we curate and benchmark three practical sports datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model. We hope that our work can advance the understanding of human movement in real-world applications, particularly in sports.

| **[Partially Observed Trajectory Inference using Optimal Transport and a Dynamics Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07475v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory inference seeks to recover the temporal dynamics of a population from snapshots of its (uncoupled) temporal marginals, i.e. where observed particles are not tracked over time. Prior works addressed this challenging problem under a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model with a gradient-driven drift in the observed space, introducing a minimum entropy estimator relative to the Wiener measure and a practical grid-free mean-field Langevin (MFL) algorithm using Schr\"odinger bridges. Motivated by the success of observable state space models in the traditional paired trajectory inference problem (e.g. target tracking), we extend the above framework to a class of latent SDEs in the form of observable state space models. In this setting, we use partial observations to infer trajectories in the latent space under a specified dynamics model (e.g. the constant velocity/acceleration models from target tracking). We introduce the PO-MFL algorithm to solve this latent trajectory inference problem and provide theoretical guarantees to the partially observed setting. Experiments validate the robustness of our method and the exponential convergence of the MFL dynamics, and demonstrate significant outperformance over the latent-free baseline in key scenarios.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Due to the potentially long distance of the UAV's flight, frequent handovers may be incurred among different GBSs, which leads to various practical issues such as large delay and synchronization overhead. To address this problem, we investigate the trajectory optimization of the UAV to minimize the number of GBS handovers during the flight, subject to a communication quality constraint and a maximum mission completion time constraint. Although this problem is non-convex and difficult to solve, we derive useful structures of the optimal solution, based on which we propose an efficient algorithm based on graph theory and Lagrangian relaxation for finding a high-quality suboptimal solution in polynomial time. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed trajectory design.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in IEEE Wireless Communications Letters</p></details> |

Unlike competing-event models, the events here are not mutually exclusive and often exhibit statistical dependencies. Existing approaches for multi-event survival analysis have generally been limited, most focusing on producing simple risk scores for each event, rather than the time-to-event itself. To overcome these issues, we introduce MENSA, a novel deep learning approach for multi-event survival analysis. MENSA jointly learns representations of the input features while capturing the complex dependence structure among events. In practice, it attempts to optimize the sum of the traditional negative log-likelihood across events and a novel trajectory-based likelihood, which encourages the model to learn the temporal order in which events occur. Experiments on real-world clinical datasets show that MENSA consistently gives good discrimination performances and accurate time-to-event predictions in single-event, competing-risk, and multi-event problems. Additionally, MENSA is more computationally-efficient, requiring fewer parameters and FLOPs than multiple state-of-the-art survival baselines when applied to large-dimensional datasets (more than 100 features).</p></details> |  |

Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 20.81% in satisfying traversability constraints and 28.51% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, adjusting specific elements in generated videos, such as object motion or camera movement, is often a tedious process of trial and error, e.g., involving re-generating videos with different random seeds. Recent techniques address this issue by fine-tuning a pre-trained model to follow conditioning signals, such as bounding boxes or point trajectories. Yet, this fine-tuning procedure can be computationally expensive, and it requires datasets with annotated object motion, which can be difficult to procure. In this work, we introduce SG-I2V, a framework for controllable image-to-video generation that is self-guided$\unicode{x2013}$offering zero-shot control by relying solely on the knowledge present in a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model without the need for fine-tuning or external knowledge.

Exiting efforts focus on single-frame cooperative perception, however, how to capture the temporal cue between frames with V2X to facilitate the prediction task even the planning task is still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Co-MTP, a general cooperative trajectory prediction framework with multi-temporal fusion for autonomous driving, which leverages the V2X system to fully capture the interaction among agents in both history and future domains to benefit the planning. In the history domain, V2X can complement the incomplete history trajectory in single-vehicle perception, and we design a heterogeneous graph transformer to learn the fusion of the history feature from multiple agents and capture the history interaction. Moreover, the goal of prediction is to support future planning. Thus, in the future domain, V2X can provide the prediction results of surrounding objects, and we further extend the graph transformer to capture the future interaction among the ego planning and the other vehicles' intentions and obtain the final future scenario state under a certain planning action. We evaluate the Co-MTP framework on the real-world dataset V2X-Seq, and the results show that Co-MTP achieves state-of-the-art performance and that both history and future fusion can greatly benefit prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, ICRA 2025</p></details> |

| **[Patient Trajectory Prediction: Integrating Clinical Notes with Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18009v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting disease trajectories from electronic health records (EHRs) is a complex task due to major challenges such as data non-stationarity, high granularity of medical codes, and integration of multimodal data. EHRs contain both structured data, such as diagnostic codes, and unstructured data, such as clinical notes, which hold essential information often overlooked. Current models, primarily based on structured data, struggle to capture the complete medical context of patients, resulting in a loss of valuable information. To address this issue, we propose an approach that integrates unstructured clinical notes into transformer-based deep learning models for sequential disease prediction. This integration enriches the representation of patients' medical histories, thereby improving the accuracy of diagnosis predictions. Experiments on MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional models relying solely on structured data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quadrotor Neural Dead Reckoning in Periodic Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17964v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real world scenarios, due to environmental or hardware constraints, the quadrotor is forced to navigate in pure inertial navigation mode while operating indoors or outdoors. To mitigate inertial drift, end-to-end neural network approaches combined with quadrotor periodic trajectories were suggested. There, the quadrotor distance is regressed and combined with inertial model-based heading estimation, the quadrotor position vector is estimated. To further enhance positioning performance, in this paper we propose a quadrotor neural dead reckoning approach for quadrotors flying on periodic trajectories. In this case, the inertial readings are fed into a simple and efficient network to directly estimate the quadrotor position vector. Our approach was evaluated on two different quadrotors, one operating indoors while the other outdoors. Our approach improves the positioning accuracy of other deep-learning approaches, achieving an average 27% reduction in error outdoors and an average 79% reduction indoors, while requiring only software modifications. With the improved positioning accuracy achieved by our method, the quadrotor can seamlessly perform its tasks.</p></details> |  |

| **[Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Trajectory Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15429v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

In those trajectory-based distillation methods, consistency distillation requires the self-consistent trajectory projection to regulate the trajectory, which might avoid the common ODE approximation error {while still be concerning about sampling efficiencies}. At the same time, rectified flow distillations enforce straight trajectory for fast sampling, although an ODE solver is still required. In this work, we propose a trajectory distillation method, \modelname, that enjoys the benefits of both and enables few-step generations. TraFlow adopts the settings of consistency trajectory models, and further enforces the properties of self-consistency and straightness throughout the entire trajectory. These two properties are pursued by reaching a balance with following three targets: (1) reconstruct the output from pre-trained models; (2) learn the amount of changes by pre-trained models; (3) satisfy the self-consistency over its trajectory. Extensive experimental results have shown the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterizing Structured versus Unstructured Environments based on Pedestrians' and Vehicles' Motion Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16847v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory behaviours of pedestrians and vehicles operating close to each other can be different in unstructured compared to structured environments. These differences in the motion behaviour are valuable to be considered in the trajectory prediction algorithm of an autonomous vehicle. However, the available datasets on pedestrians' and vehicles' trajectories that are commonly used as benchmarks for trajectory prediction have not been classified based on the nature of their environment. On the other hand, the definitions provided for unstructured and structured environments are rather qualitative and hard to be used for justifying the type of a given environment. In this paper, we have compared different existing datasets based on a couple of extracted trajectory features, such as mean speed and trajectory variability. Through K-means clustering and generalized linear models, we propose more quantitative measures for distinguishing the two different types of environments. Our results show that features such as trajectory variability, stop fraction and density of pedestrians are different among the two environmental types and can be used to classify the existing datasets.</p></details> |  |

Reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning schemes face issues of low search efficiency and learning instability when optimizing large-scale systems. To address these issues, we present an Attention-based UAV Trajectory Optimization (AUTO) framework based on the graph transformer, which consists of an Attention Trajectory Optimization Model (ATOM) and a Trajectory lEarNing Method based on Actor-critic (TENMA). In ATOM, a graph encoder is used to calculate the self-attention characteristics of all IoTDs, and a trajectory decoder is developed to optimize the number and trajectories of UAVs. TENMA then trains the ATOM using an improved Actor-Critic method, in which the real reward of the system is applied as the baseline to reduce variances in the critic network. This method is suitable for high-quality and large-scale multi-UAV trajectory planning. Finally, we develop numerous experiments, including a hardware experiment in the field case, to verify the feasibility and efficiency of the AUTO framework.</p></details> |  |

However, existing datasets often suffer from limited scale diversity and inaccurate annotations, hindering robust model development. This paper introduces UAVDB, a high-resolution UAV detection dataset constructed using Patch Intensity Convergence (PIC). This novel technique automatically generates high-fidelity bounding box annotations from UAV trajectory data~\cite{li2020reconstruction}, eliminating the need for manual labeling. UAVDB features single-class annotations with a fixed-camera setup and consists of RGB frames capturing UAVs across various scales, from large-scale UAVs to near-single-pixel representations, along with challenging backgrounds that pose difficulties for modern detectors. We first validate the accuracy and efficiency of PIC-generated bounding boxes by comparing Intersection over Union (IoU) performance and runtime against alternative annotation methods, demonstrating that PIC achieves higher annotation accuracy while being more efficient. Subsequently, we benchmark UAVDB using state-of-the-art (SOTA) YOLO-series detectors, establishing UAVDB as a valuable resource for advancing long-range and high-resolution UAV detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Different from the classical state space model, our series of studies, including this paper, model the collection of the target state as a stochastic process (SP) that is further decomposed into a deterministic part which represents the trend of the trajectory and a residual SP representing the residual fitting error. Subsequently, the tracking problem is formulated as a learning problem regarding the trajectory SP for which a key part is to estimate a trajectory FoT (T-FoT) best fitting the measurements in time series. For this purpose, we consider the polynomial T-FoT and address the regularized polynomial T-FoT optimization employing two distinct regularization strategies seeking trade-off between the accuracy and simplicity. One limits the order of the polynomial and then the best choice is determined by grid searching in a narrow, bounded range while the other adopts $\ell_0$ norm regularization for which the hybrid Newton solver is employed. Simulation results obtained in both single and multiple maneuvering target scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part II of a series of companion papers; 11 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing PPO with Trajectory-Aware Hybrid Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15968v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is one of the most popular state-of-the-art on-policy algorithms that has become a standard baseline in modern reinforcement learning with applications in numerous fields. Though it delivers stable performance with theoretical policy improvement guarantees, high variance, and high sample complexity still remain critical challenges in on-policy algorithms. To alleviate these issues, we propose Hybrid-Policy Proximal Policy Optimization (HP3O), which utilizes a trajectory replay buffer to make efficient use of trajectories generated by recent policies. Particularly, the buffer applies the "first in, first out" (FIFO) strategy so as to keep only the recent trajectories to attenuate the data distribution drift. A batch consisting of the trajectory with the best return and other randomly sampled ones from the buffer is used for updating the policy networks. The strategy helps the agent to improve its capability on top of the most recent best performance and in turn reduce variance empirically. We theoretically construct the policy improvement guarantees for the proposed algorithm. HP3O is validated and compared against several baseline algorithms using multiple continuous control environments. Our code is available here.</p></details> |  |

It is classified into pedestrian or heterogeneous trajectory prediction. The former exploits the relatively consistent behavior of pedestrians, but is limited in real-world scenarios with heterogeneous traffic agents such as cyclists and vehicles. The latter typically relies on extra class label information to distinguish the heterogeneous agents, but such labels are costly to annotate and cannot be generalized to represent different behaviors within the same class of agents. In this work, we introduce the behavioral pseudo-labels that effectively capture the behavior distributions of pedestrians and heterogeneous agents solely based on their motion features, significantly improving the accuracy of trajectory prediction. To implement the framework, we propose the Behavioral Pseudo-Label Informed Sparse Graph Convolution Network (BP-SGCN) that learns pseudo-labels and informs to a trajectory predictor. For optimization, we propose a cascaded training scheme, in which we first learn the pseudo-labels in an unsupervised manner, and then perform end-to-end fine-tuning on the labels in the direction of increasing the trajectory prediction accuracy. Experiments show that our pseudo-labels effectively model different behavior clusters and improve trajectory prediction. Our proposed BP-SGCN outperforms existing methods using both pedestrian (ETH/UCY, pedestrian-only SDD) and heterogeneous agent datasets (SDD, Argoverse 1).</p></details> |  |
| **[A View of the Certainty-Equivalence Method for PAC RL as an Application of the Trajectory Tree Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02652v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) enables an agent interacting with an unknown MDP $M$ to optimise its behaviour by observing transitions sampled from $M$. A natural entity that emerges in the agent's reasoning is $\widehat{M}$, the maximum likelihood estimate of $M$ based on the observed transitions. The well-known \textit{certainty-equivalence} method (CEM) dictates that the agent update its behaviour to $\widehat{\pi}$, which is an optimal policy for $\widehat{M}$. Not only is CEM intuitive, it has been shown to enjoy minimax-optimal sample complexity in some regions of the parameter space for PAC RL with a generative model~\citep{Agarwal2020GenModel}. A seemingly unrelated algorithm is the ``trajectory tree method'' (TTM)~\citep{Kearns+MN:1999}, originally developed for efficient decision-time planning in large POMDPs. This paper presents a theoretical investigation that stems from the surprising finding that CEM may indeed be viewed as an application of TTM. The qualitative benefits of this view are (1) new and simple proofs of sample complexity upper bounds for CEM, in fact under a (2) weaker assumption on the rewards than is prevalent in the current literature. Our analysis applies to both non-stationary and stationary MDPs. Quantitatively, we obtain (3) improvements in the sample-complexity upper bounds for CEM both for non-stationary and stationary MDPs, in the regime that the ``mistake probability'' $\delta$ is small. Additionally, we show (4) a lower bound on the sample complexity for finite-horizon MDPs, which establishes the minimax-optimality of our upper bound for non-stationary MDPs in the small-$\delta$ regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, excluding references and appendices.

| **[Interactive incremental learning of generalizable skills with local trajectory modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05655v3)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of generalization in learning from demonstration (LfD) has received considerable attention over the years, particularly within the context of movement primitives, where a number of approaches have emerged. Recently, two important approaches have gained recognition. While one leverages via-points to adapt skills locally by modulating demonstrated trajectories, another relies on so-called task-parameterized models that encode movements with respect to different coordinate systems, using a product of probabilities for generalization. While the former are well-suited to precise, local modulations, the latter aim at generalizing over large regions of the workspace and often involve multiple objects. Addressing the quality of generalization by leveraging both approaches simultaneously has received little attention. In this work, we propose an interactive imitation learning framework that simultaneously leverages local and global modulations of trajectory distributions. Building on the kernelized movement primitives (KMP) framework, we introduce novel mechanisms for skill modulation from direct human corrective feedback. Our approach particularly exploits the concept of via-points to incrementally and interactively 1) improve the model accuracy locally, 2) add new objects to the task during execution and 3) extend the skill into regions where demonstrations were not provided. We evaluate our method on a bearing ring-loading task using a torque-controlled, 7-DoF, DLR SARA robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), 16 pages, 19 figures, 6 tables.

| **[From Text to Trajectory: Exploring Complex Constraint Representation and Decomposition in Safe Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08920v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe reinforcement learning (RL) requires the agent to finish a given task while obeying specific constraints. Giving constraints in natural language form has great potential for practical scenarios due to its flexible transfer capability and accessibility. Previous safe RL methods with natural language constraints typically need to design cost functions manually for each constraint, which requires domain expertise and lacks flexibility. In this paper, we harness the dual role of text in this task, using it not only to provide constraint but also as a training signal. We introduce the Trajectory-level Textual Constraints Translator (TTCT) to replace the manually designed cost function. Our empirical results demonstrate that TTCT effectively comprehends textual constraint and trajectory, and the policies trained by TTCT can achieve a lower violation rate than the standard cost function. Extra studies are conducted to demonstrate that the TTCT has zero-shot transfer capability to adapt to constraint-shift environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Real-Time Moving Flock Detection in Pedestrian Trajectories Using Sequential Deep Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15252v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding collective pedestrian movement is crucial for applications in crowd management, autonomous navigation, and human-robot interaction. This paper investigates the use of sequential deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformers, for real-time flock detection in multi-pedestrian trajectories. Our proposed approach consists of a two-stage process: first, a pre-trained binary classification model is used for pairwise trajectory classification, and second, the learned representations are applied to identify multi-agent flocks dynamically. We validate our method using real-world group movement datasets, demonstrating its robustness across varying sequence lengths and diverse movement patterns. Experimental results indicate that our model consistently detects pedestrian flocks with high accuracy and stability, even in dynamic and noisy environments. Furthermore, we extend our approach to identify other forms of collective motion, such as convoys and swarms, paving the way for more comprehensive multi-agent behavior analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[DDAT: Diffusion Policies Enforcing Dynamically Admissible Robot Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15043v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at creating images and videos thanks to their multimodal generative capabilities. These same capabilities have made diffusion models increasingly popular in robotics research, where they are used for generating robot motion. However, the stochastic nature of diffusion models is fundamentally at odds with the precise dynamical equations describing the feasible motion of robots. Hence, generating dynamically admissible robot trajectories is a challenge for diffusion models. To alleviate this issue, we introduce DDAT: Diffusion policies for Dynamically Admissible Trajectories to generate provably admissible trajectories of black-box robotic systems using diffusion models. A sequence of states is a dynamically admissible trajectory if each state of the sequence belongs to the reachable set of its predecessor by the robot's equations of motion. To generate such trajectories, our diffusion policies project their predictions onto a dynamically admissible manifold during both training and inference to align the objective of the denoiser neural network with the dynamical admissibility constraint. The auto-regressive nature of these projections along with the black-box nature of robot dynamics render these projections immensely challenging. We thus enforce admissibility by iteratively sampling a polytopic under-approximation of the reachable set of a state onto which we project its predicted successor, before iterating this process with the projected successor. By producing accurate trajectories, this projection eliminates the need for diffusion models to continually replan, enabling one-shot long-horizon trajectory planning. We demonstrate that our framework generates higher quality dynamically admissible robot trajectories through extensive simulations on a quadcopter and various MuJoCo environments, along with real-world experiments on a Unitree GO1 and GO2.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Finding Complex Patterns in Trajectory Data via Geometric Set Cover](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14865v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustering trajectories is a central challenge when faced with large amounts of movement data such as GPS data. We study a clustering problem that can be stated as a geometric set cover problem: Given a polygonal curve of complexity $n$, find the smallest number $k$ of representative trajectories of complexity at most $l$ such that any point on the input trajectories lies on a subtrajectory of the input that has Fr\'echet distance at most $\Delta$ to one of the representative trajectories. In previous work, Br\"uning et al.~(2022) developed a bicriteria approximation algorithm that returns a set of curves of size $O(kl\log(kl))$ which covers the input with a radius of $11\Delta$ in time $\widetilde{O}((kl)^2n + kln^3)$, where $k$ is the smallest number of curves of complexity $l$ needed to cover the input with a radius of $\Delta$. The representative trajectories computed by this algorithm are always line segments. In the applications however, one is usually interested in more complex representative curves which consist of several edges. We present a new approach that builds upon previous work computing a set of curves of size $O(k\log(n))$ in time $\widetilde{O}(l^2n^4 + kln^4)$ with the same distance guarantee of $11\Delta$, where each curve may consist of curves of complexity up to the given complexity parameter~$l$. We conduct experiments on tracking data of ocean currents and full body motion data suggesting its validity as a tool for analyzing large spatio-temporal data sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Target Tracking to Targeting Track -- Part I: A Metric for Spatio-Temporal Trajectory Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15842v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of target tracking, performance evaluation plays a pivotal role in the design, comparison, and analytics of trackers. Compared with the traditional trajectory composed of a set of point-estimates obtained by a tracker in the measurement time-series, the trajectory that our series of studies including this paper pursued is given by a curve function of time (FoT). The trajectory FoT provides complete information of the movement of the target over time and can be used to infer the state corresponding to arbitrary time, not only at the measurement time. However, there are no metrics available for comparing and evaluating the trajectory FoT. To address this lacuna, we propose a metric denominated as the spatiotemporal-aligned trajectory integral distance (Star-ID). The StarID associates and aligns the estimated and actual trajectories in the spatio-temporal domain and distinguishes between the time-aligned and unaligned segments in calculating the spatial divergence including false alarm, miss-detection and localization errors. The effectiveness of the proposed distance metric and the time-averaged version is validated through theoretical analysis and numerical examples of a single target or multiple targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part I of a series of companion papers; 11 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

In practice, however, MPPI often struggles to guarantee safety assurance and balance efficient sampling in open spaces with the need for more extensive exploration under tight constraints. To address this challenge, we incorporate discrete barrier states (DBaS) into MPPI and propose a novel MPPI-DBaS algorithm that ensures system safety and enables adaptive exploration across diverse scenarios. We evaluate our method in simulation experiments where the vehicle navigates through closely placed obstacles. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms standard MPPI, achieving a higher success rate and lower tracking errors.</p></details> | CCC 2025 |
| **[STeCa: Step-level Trajectory Calibration for LLM Agent Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14276v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in tackling complex tasks by interacting dynamically with the environment. Existing work primarily focuses on behavior cloning from expert demonstrations and preference learning through exploratory trajectory sampling. However, these methods often struggle in long-horizon tasks, where suboptimal actions accumulate step by step, causing agents to deviate from correct task trajectories. To address this, we highlight the importance of timely calibration and the need to automatically construct calibration trajectories for training agents. We propose Step-Level Trajectory Calibration (STeCa), a novel framework for LLM agent learning. Specifically, STeCa identifies suboptimal actions through a step-level reward comparison during exploration. It constructs calibrated trajectories using LLM-driven reflection, enabling agents to learn from improved decision-making processes. These calibrated trajectories, together with successful trajectory data, are utilized for reinforced training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STeCa significantly outperforms existing methods. Further analysis highlights that step-level calibration enables agents to complete tasks with greater robustness.

| **[An Online Optimization-Based Trajectory Planning Approach for Cooperative Landing Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13823v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a real-time trajectory planning scheme for a heterogeneous multi-robot system (consisting of a quadrotor and a ground mobile robot) for a cooperative landing task, where the landing position, landing time, and coordination between the robots are determined autonomously under the consideration of feasibility and user specifications. The proposed framework leverages the potential of the complementarity constraint as a decision-maker and an indicator for diverse cooperative tasks and extends it to the collaborative landing scenario. In a potential application of the proposed methodology, a ground mobile robot may serve as a mobile charging station and coordinates in real-time with a quadrotor to be charged, facilitating a safe and efficient rendezvous and landing. We verified the generated trajectories in simulation and real-world applications, demonstrating the real-time capabilities of the proposed landing planning framework.</p></details> |  |

The key challenge lies in leveraging latent spatiotemporal correlations within RSS data while navigating complex road networks. To address this, we develop a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based RSS embedding (HRE) technique that employs alternating optimization to infer vehicle trajectories from RSS measurements. This model captures spatiotemporal dependencies while a road graph ensures network compliance. Additionally, we introduce a maximum speed-constrained rough trajectory estimation (MSR) method to guide the optimization process, enabling rapid convergence to a favorable local solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explorer: Scaling Exploration-driven Web Trajectory Synthesis for Multimodal Web Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11357v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent success in large multimodal models (LMMs) has sparked promising applications of agents capable of autonomously completing complex web tasks. While open-source LMM agents have made significant advances in offline evaluation benchmarks, their performance still falls substantially short of human-level capabilities in more realistic online settings. A key bottleneck is the lack of diverse and large-scale trajectory-level datasets across various domains, which are expensive to collect. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a scalable recipe to synthesize the largest and most diverse trajectory-level dataset to date, containing over 94K successful multimodal web trajectories, spanning 49K unique URLs, 720K screenshots, and 33M web elements. In particular, we leverage extensive web exploration and refinement to obtain diverse task intents. The average cost is 28 cents per successful trajectory, making it affordable to a wide range of users in the community. Leveraging this dataset, we train Explorer, a multimodal web agent, and demonstrate strong performance on both offline and online web agent benchmarks such as Mind2Web-Live, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and MiniWob++. Additionally, our experiments highlight data scaling as a key driver for improving web agent capabilities. We hope this study makes state-of-the-art LMM-based agent research at a larger scale more accessible.</p></details> | 24 pages, 7 figures |
| **[BoundPlanner: A convex-set-based approach to bounded manipulator trajectory planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13286v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online trajectory planning enables robot manipulators to react quickly to changing environments or tasks. Many robot trajectory planners exist for known environments but are often too slow for online computations. Current methods in online trajectory planning do not find suitable trajectories in challenging scenarios that respect the limits of the robot and account for collisions. This work proposes a trajectory planning framework consisting of the novel Cartesian path planner based on convex sets, called BoundPlanner, and the online trajectory planner BoundMPC. BoundPlanner explores and maps the collision-free space using convex sets to compute a reference path with bounds. BoundMPC is extended in this work to handle convex sets for path deviations, which allows the robot to optimally follow the path within the bounds while accounting for the robot's kinematics. Collisions of the robot's kinematic chain are considered by a novel convex-set-based collision avoidance formulation independent on the number of obstacles. Simulations and experiments with a 7-DoF manipulator show the performance of the proposed planner compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at github.com/Thieso/BoundPlanner and videos of the experiments can be found at www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/42d4</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Our vehicle simulator efficiently models vehicle motion, generating trajectories that can be supervised to fit real-world data. By leveraging its differentiable nature, IDM parameters are optimized using gradient-based methods. With the capability to simulate up to 2 million vehicles in real time, the system is scalable for large-scale trajectory optimization. We show that we can use the simulator to filter noise in the input trajectories (trajectory filtering), reconstruct dense trajectories from sparse ones (trajectory reconstruction), and predict future trajectories (trajectory prediction), with all generated trajectories adhering to physical laws. We validate our simulator and algorithm on several datasets including NGSIM and Waymo Open Dataset.

To address this challenge, and reduce the risk of disrupting operations, we leverage recent advances in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) to develop a neural state-space model (NSSM) that predicts plasma dynamics during Tokamak \`a Configuration Variable (TCV) rampdowns. By integrating simple physics structure and data-driven models, the NSSM efficiently learns plasma dynamics during the rampdown from a modest dataset of 311 pulses with only five pulses in the reactor relevant high performance regime. The NSSM is parallelized across uncertainties, and reinforcement learning (RL) is applied to design trajectories that avoid multiple instability limits with high probability. Experiments at TCV ramping down high performance plasmas show statistically significant improvements in current and energy at plasma termination, with improvements in speed through continuous re-training. A predict-first experiment, increasing plasma current by 20\% from baseline, demonstrates the NSSM's ability to make small extrapolations with sufficient accuracy to design trajectories that successfully terminate the pulse. The developed approach paves the way for designing tokamak controls with robustness to considerable uncertainty, and demonstrates the relevance of the SciML approach to learning plasma dynamics for rapidly developing robust trajectories and controls during the incremental campaigns of upcoming burning plasma tokamaks.</p></details> |  |

Existing RL-based fine-tuning methods focus on single training timesteps and neglect trajectory-level alignment, while recent sampling trajectory optimization methods incur significant inference NFE costs. Diffusion-Sharpening overcomes this by using a path integral framework to select optimal trajectories during training, leveraging reward feedback, and amortizing inference costs. Our method demonstrates superior training efficiency with faster convergence, and best inference efficiency without requiring additional NFEs. Extensive experiments show that Diffusion-Sharpening outperforms RL-based fine-tuning methods (e.g., Diffusion-DPO) and sampling trajectory optimization methods (e.g., Inference Scaling) across diverse metrics including text alignment, compositional capabilities, and human preferences, offering a scalable and efficient solution for future diffusion model fine-tuning.

| **[Leader and Follower: Interactive Motion Generation under Trajectory Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11563v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of game and film production, generating interactive motion from texts has garnered significant attention due to its potential to revolutionize content creation processes. In many practical applications, there is a need to impose strict constraints on the motion range or trajectory of virtual characters. However, existing methods that rely solely on textual input face substantial challenges in accurately capturing the user's intent, particularly in specifying the desired trajectory. As a result, the generated motions often lack plausibility and accuracy. Moreover, existing trajectory - based methods for customized motion generation rely on retraining for single - actor scenarios, which limits flexibility and adaptability to different datasets, as well as interactivity in two-actor motions. To generate interactive motion following specified trajectories, this paper decouples complex motion into a Leader - Follower dynamic, inspired by role allocation in partner dancing. Based on this framework, this paper explores the motion range refinement process in interactive motion generation and proposes a training-free approach, integrating a Pace Controller and a Kinematic Synchronization Adapter. The framework enhances the ability of existing models to generate motion that adheres to trajectory by controlling the leader's movement and correcting the follower's motion to align with the leader. Experimental results show that the proposed approach, by better leveraging trajectory information, outperforms existing methods in both realism and accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Such a system of $[0,1]$-valued piecewise linear trajectories arises as a scaling limit of the system of logarithmic subpopulation sizes in a certain population-genetic model (more precisely, a Moran model) with mutation and selection. By definition, the resident fitness is initially 0 and afterwards it increases by the ultimate slope of each trajectory that reaches height 1. We show that although the interaction of $n$ trajectories may yield $\Omega(n^2)$ slope changes in total, the resident fitness (at all times) can be computed algorithmically in $O(n)$ time. Our algorithm is given in terms of the so-called continued lines representation of the system of interacting trajectories. In the special case of Poissonian interacting trajectories where the birth times of the trajectories form a Poisson process and the initial slopes are random and i.i.d., we show that even the expected number of slope changes grows only linearly in time.</p></details> |  |

However, accurate position data of a target mobile device, typically obtained from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), cellular networks, or WiFi, may not always be accessible to first responders. For instance, 1) accuracy and availability can be limited in challenging signal reception environments, and 2) in regions where emergency location services are not mandatory, certain mobile devices may not transmit their location during emergencies. As an alternative localization method, a network of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be employed to passively locate targets by collecting radio frequency (RF) signal measurements, such as received signal strength (RSS). In these situations, UAV trajectories play a critical role in localization performance, influencing both accuracy and search time. Previous studies optimized UAV trajectories using the determinant of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), but its performance declines under unfavorable geometric conditions, such as when UAVs start from a single base, leading to position ambiguity. To address this, our prior work introduced a rigidity-based approach, which improved the search time compared to FIM-based methods in our simulation case. However, the high computational cost of rigidity-based optimization, primarily due to singular value decomposition (SVD), limits its practicality. In this paper, we applied techniques to reduce computational complexity, including randomized SVD, smooth SVD, and vertex pruning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ION ITM 2025</p></details> |

Past research relied on incorporating deterministic future states of surrounding pedestrians which can be overconfident leading to unsafe robot behaviour. The current paper proposes a predictive uncertainty-aware planner that integrates neural network based probabilistic trajectory prediction into planning. Our method uses a deep ensemble based network for probabilistic forecasting of surrounding humans and integrates the predictive uncertainty as constraints into the planner. We compare numerous constraint satisfaction methods on the planner and evaluated its performance on real world pedestrian datasets. Further, offline robot navigation was carried out on out-of-distribution pedestrian trajectories inside a narrow corridor</p></details> |  |

A key challenge is how to mitigate compounding errors in imitation learning, which lead to cascading failures over extended trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose the Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy (DTP) framework, which generates 2D trajectories through a diffusion model to guide policy learning for long-horizon tasks. By leveraging task-relevant trajectories, DTP provides trajectory-level guidance to reduce error accumulation. Our two-stage approach first trains a generative vision-language model to create diffusion-based trajectories, then refines the imitation policy using them. Experiments on the CALVIN benchmark show that DTP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25% in success rate, starting from scratch without external pretraining. Moreover, DTP significantly improves real-world robot performance.</p></details> |  |

Without loosing any information, we associate to each state a binary random function, taking values in $\{0,1\}$, and turn the problem of statistical modeling of a categorical process into a multivariate functional data analysis issue. The (multivariate) covariance operator has nice interpretations in terms of departure from independence of the joint probabilities and the multivariate functional principal components are simple to interpret. Under the weak hypothesis assuming only continuity in probability of the $0-1$ trajectories, it is simple to build consistent estimators of the covariance kernel and perform multivariate functional principal components analysis. The sample paths being piecewise constant, with a finite number of jumps, this a rare case in functional data analysis in which the trajectories can be observed exhaustively. The approach is illustrated on a data set of sensory perceptions, considering different gustometer-controlled stimuli experiments. We show how it can be easily extended to analyze experiments, such as temporal check-all-that-apply, in which two states or more can be observed at the same time.</p></details> |  |

We frame this problem as an instance of abduction guided by a novel parsimony function represented as an aggregate truth value over an annotated logic program. This approach has the added benefit of affording explainability to an analyst user. By showing that any subset of such a program can provide a lower bound on this parsimony requirement, we are able to abduce movement trajectories efficiently through an informed (i.e., A*) search. We describe how our implementation was enhanced with the application of multiple techniques in order to be scaled and integrated with a cloud-based software stack that included bottom-up rule learning, geolocated knowledge graph retrieval/management, and interfaces with government systems for independently conducted government-run tests for which we provide results. We also report on our own experiments showing that we not only provide exact results but also scale to very large scenarios and provide realistic agent trajectories that can go undetected by machine learning anomaly detectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICLP 2024, arXiv:2502.08453</p></details> |

Our analysis demonstrates that poor quality input leads to noisy and unreliable predictions, which can be detrimental to navigation modules. We evaluate both input data quality and model output to illustrate the impact of input noise. Furthermore, we show that our estimation system enables effective training of trajectory prediction models even with limited data, producing robust predictions across different environments. Accurate estimations are crucial for deploying trajectory prediction models in real-world scenarios, and our system ensures meaningful and reliable results across various application contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, IEEE INTELLIGENT VEHICLES SYMPOSIUM (IV 2025)</p></details> |
| **[EPN: An Ego Vehicle Planning-Informed Network for Target Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14442v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction plays a crucial role in improving the safety of autonomous vehicles. However, due to the highly dynamic and multimodal nature of the task, accurately predicting the future trajectory of a target vehicle remains a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose an Ego vehicle Planning-informed Network (EPN) for multimodal trajectory prediction. In real-world driving, the future trajectory of a vehicle is influenced not only by its own historical trajectory, but also by the behavior of other vehicles. So, we incorporate the future planned trajectory of the ego vehicle as an additional input to simulate the mutual influence between vehicles. Furthermore, to tackle the challenges of intention ambiguity and large prediction errors often encountered in methods based on driving intentions, we propose an endpoint prediction module for the target vehicle.

One-step diffusion models generate high-quality images in a one sampling step, greatly reducing computational overhead and inference latency. However, most existing one-step diffusion methods are constrained by the performance of the teacher model, where poor teacher performance results in image artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose FluxSR, a novel one-step diffusion Real-ISR technique based on flow matching models. We use the state-of-the-art diffusion model FLUX.1-dev as both the teacher model and the base model. First, we introduce Flow Trajectory Distillation (FTD) to distill a multi-step flow matching model into a one-step Real-ISR. Second, to improve image realism and address high-frequency artifact issues in generated images, we propose TV-LPIPS as a perceptual loss and introduce Attention Diversification Loss (ADL) as a regularization term to reduce token similarity in transformer, thereby eliminating high-frequency artifacts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing one-step diffusion-based Real-ISR methods. The code and model will be released at https://github.com/JianzeLi-114/FluxSR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Vulnerabilities of GPS Trip Data to Trajectory-User Linking Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08217v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open human mobility data is considered an essential basis for the profound research and analysis required for the transition to sustainable mobility and sustainable urban planning. Cycling data has especially been the focus of data collection endeavors in recent years. Although privacy risks regarding location data are widely known, practitioners often refrain from advanced privacy mechanisms to prevent utility losses. Removing user identifiers from trips is thereby deemed a major privacy gain, as it supposedly prevents linking single trips to obtain entire movement patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel attack to reconstruct user identifiers in GPS trip datasets consisting of single trips, unlike previous ones that are dedicated to evaluating trajectory-user linking in the context of check-in data. We evaluate the remaining privacy risk for users in such datasets and our empirical findings from two real-world datasets show that the risk of re-identification is significant even when personal identifiers have been removed, and that truncation as a simple additional privacy mechanism may not be effective in protecting user privacy. Further investigations indicate that users who frequently visit locations that are only visited by a small number of others, tend to be more vulnerable to re-identification.</p></details> | 32 pages, 15 figures |
| **[RouteFlow: Trajectory-Aware Animated Transitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08076v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Animating objects' movements is widely used to facilitate tracking changes and observing both the global trend and local hotspots where objects converge or diverge. Existing methods, however, often obscure critical local hotspots by only considering the start and end positions of objects' trajectories. To address this gap, we propose RouteFlow, a trajectory-aware animated transition method that effectively balances the global trend and local hotspots while minimizing occlusion. RouteFlow is inspired by a real-world bus route analogy: objects are regarded as passengers traveling together, with local hotspots representing bus stops where these passengers get on and off. Based on this analogy, animation paths are generated like bus routes, with the object layout generated similarly to seat allocation according to their destinations. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, RouteFlow better facilitates identifying the global trend and locating local hotspots while performing comparably in tracking objects' movements.</p></details> | Accepted to CHI 2025 |

As the backbone of next-generation solutions, these robots face a critical challenge: managing and minimizing the swept volume during turns while maintaining precise control. Traditional systems designed for standard vehicles often struggle with the complex dynamics of multi-axle configurations, leading to inefficiency and increased safety risk in confined spaces. Our innovative framework overcomes these limitations by combining swept volume minimization with Signed Distance Field (SDF) path planning and model predictive control (MPC) for independent wheel steering. This approach not only plans paths with an awareness of the swept volume but actively minimizes it in real-time, allowing each axle to follow a precise trajectory while significantly reducing the space the vehicle occupies. By predicting future states and adjusting the turning radius of each wheel, our method enhances both maneuverability and safety, even in the most constrained environments. Unlike previous works, our solution goes beyond basic path calculation and tracking, offering real-time path optimization with minimal swept volume and efficient individual axle control. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive approach to tackle these challenges, delivering life-saving improvements in control, efficiency, and safety for multi-axle AMRs. Furthermore, we will open-source our work to foster collaboration and enable others to advance safer, more efficient autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Despite significant advancements in this field, existing studies primarily neglect the high-order inter-trajectory relationships, which represent complex associations among multiple trajectories, manifested through multi-location co-occurrence patterns emerging when trajectories intersect at various Points of Interest (POIs). Furthermore, they also overlook the variable influence of POIs on different trajectories, as well as the user class imbalance problem caused by disparities in user activity levels and check-in frequencies. To address these limitations, we propose a novel HyperGraph-based multi-perspective Trajectory User Linking model (HGTUL). Our model learns trajectory representations from both relational and spatio-temporal perspectives: (1) it captures high-order associations among trajectories by constructing a trajectory hypergraph and leverages a hypergraph attention network to learn the variable impact of POIs on trajectories; (2) it models the spatio-temporal characteristics of trajectories by incorporating their temporal and spatial information into a sequential encoder. Moreover, we design a data balancing method to effectively address the user class imbalance problem and experimentally validate its significance in TUL. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HGTUL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improvements of 2.57%~20.09% and 5.68%~26.00% in ACC@1 and Macro-F1 metrics, respectively.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[PLMTrajRec: A Scalable and Generalizable Trajectory Recovery Method with Pre-trained Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14281v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal trajectory data is crucial for various applications. However, issues such as device malfunctions and network instability often cause sparse trajectories, leading to lost detailed movement information. Recovering the missing points in sparse trajectories to restore the detailed information is thus essential. Despite recent progress, several challenges remain. First, the lack of large-scale dense trajectory data makes it difficult to train a trajectory recovery model from scratch. Second, the varying spatiotemporal correlations in sparse trajectories make it hard to generalize recovery across different sampling intervals. Third, the lack of location information complicates the extraction of road conditions for missing points. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory recovery model called PLMTrajRec. It leverages the scalability of a pre-trained language model (PLM) and can be fine-tuned with only a limited set of dense trajectories. To handle different sampling intervals in sparse trajectories, we first convert each trajectory's sampling interval and movement features into natural language representations, allowing the PLM to recognize its interval. We then introduce a trajectory encoder to unify trajectories of varying intervals into a single interval and capture their spatiotemporal relationships. To obtain road conditions for missing points, we propose an area flow-guided implicit trajectory prompt, which models road conditions by collecting traffic flows in each region. We also introduce a road condition passing mechanism that uses observed points' road conditions to infer those of the missing points. Experiments on two public trajectory datasets with three sampling intervals each demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability, and generalization ability of PLMTrajRec.</p></details> |  |
| **[Holistic Semantic Representation for Navigational Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02737v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory generation has garnered significant attention from researchers in the field of spatio-temporal analysis, as it can generate substantial synthesized human mobility trajectories that enhance user privacy and alleviate data scarcity. However, existing trajectory generation methods often focus on improving trajectory generation quality from a singular perspective, lacking a comprehensive semantic understanding across various scales. Consequently, we are inspired to develop a HOlistic SEmantic Representation (HOSER) framework for navigational trajectory generation. Given an origin-and-destination (OD) pair and the starting time point of a latent trajectory, we first propose a Road Network Encoder to expand the receptive field of road- and zone-level semantics. Second, we design a Multi-Granularity Trajectory Encoder to integrate the spatio-temporal semantics of the generated trajectory at both the point and trajectory levels. Finally, we employ a Destination-Oriented Navigator to seamlessly integrate destination-oriented guidance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HOSER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin. Moreover, the model's performance in few-shot learning and zero-shot learning scenarios further verifies the effectiveness of our holistic semantic representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Online Aggregation of Trajectory Predictors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07178v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction, the task of forecasting future agent behavior from past data, is central to safe and efficient autonomous driving. A diverse set of methods (e.g., rule-based or learned with different architectures and datasets) have been proposed, yet it is often the case that the performance of these methods is sensitive to the deployment environment (e.g., how well the design rules model the environment, or how accurately the test data match the training data). Building upon the principled theory of online convex optimization but also going beyond convexity and stationarity, we present a lightweight and model-agnostic method to aggregate different trajectory predictors online. We propose treating each individual trajectory predictor as an "expert" and maintaining a probability vector to mix the outputs of different experts. Then, the key technical approach lies in leveraging online data -- the true agent behavior to be revealed at the next timestep -- to form a convex-or-nonconvex, stationary-or-dynamic loss function whose gradient steers the probability vector towards choosing the best mixture of experts. We instantiate this method to aggregate trajectory predictors trained on different cities in the NUSCENES dataset and show that it performs just as well, if not better than, any singular model, even when deployed on the out-of-distribution LYFT dataset.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Reward-Based Collision-Free Algorithm for Trajectory Planning of Autonomous Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06149v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a new mission planning algorithm for autonomous robots that enables the reward-based selection of an optimal waypoint sequence from a predefined set. The algorithm computes a feasible trajectory and corresponding control inputs for a robot to navigate between waypoints while avoiding obstacles, maximizing the total reward, and adhering to constraints on state, input and its derivatives, mission time window, and maximum distance. This also solves a generalized prize-collecting traveling salesman problem. The proposed algorithm employs a new genetic algorithm that evolves solution candidates toward the optimal solution based on a fitness function and crossover. During fitness evaluation, a penalty method enforces constraints, and the differential flatness property with clothoid curves efficiently penalizes infeasible trajectories. The Euler spiral method showed promising results for trajectory parameterization compared to minimum snap and jerk polynomials. Due to the discrete exploration space, crossover is performed using a dynamic time-warping-based method and extended convex combination with projection. A mutation step enhances exploration. Results demonstrate the algorithm's ability to find the optimal waypoint sequence, fulfill constraints, avoid infeasible waypoints, and prioritize high-reward ones. Simulations and experiments with a ground vehicle, quadrotor, and quadruped are presented, complemented by benchmarking and a time-complexity analysis.</p></details> |  |

While many promising methods have been developed using online corpora and captioned photographs, their application to scientific domains, where data encodes highly specialized knowledge, remains in its early stages. We present a self-supervised masked modeling framework for 3D particle trajectory analysis in Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). These detectors produce globally sparse (<1% occupancy) but locally dense point clouds, capturing meter-scale particle trajectories at millimeter resolution. Starting with PointMAE, this work proposes volumetric tokenization to group sparse ionization points into resolution-agnostic patches, as well as an auxiliary energy infilling task to improve trajectory semantics. This approach -- which we call Point-based Liquid Argon Masked Autoencoder (PoLAr-MAE) -- achieves 99.4% track and 97.7% shower classification F-scores, matching that of supervised baselines without any labeled data. While the model learns rich particle trajectory representations, it struggles with sub-token phenomena like overlapping or short-lived particle trajectories. To support further research, we release PILArNet-M -- the largest open LArTPC dataset (1M+ events, 5.2B labeled points) -- to advance SSL in high energy physics (HEP).

Traditional approaches usually focus on static road network and trajectory representation learning, and overlook the dynamic nature of traffic states and trajectories, which is crucial for downstream tasks. To address this gap, we propose TRACK, a novel framework to bridge traffic state and trajectory data for dynamic road network and trajectory representation learning. TRACK leverages graph attention networks (GAT) to encode static and spatial road segment features, and introduces a transformer-based model for trajectory representation learning. By incorporating transition probabilities from trajectory data into GAT attention weights, TRACK captures dynamic spatial features of road segments. Meanwhile, TRACK designs a traffic transformer encoder to capture the spatial-temporal dynamics of road segments from traffic state data. To further enhance dynamic representations, TRACK proposes a co-attentional transformer encoder and a trajectory-traffic state matching task. Extensive experiments on real-life urban traffic datasets demonstrate the superiority of TRACK over state-of-the-art baselines. Case studies confirm TRACK's ability to capture spatial-temporal dynamics effectively.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

In particular, real trajectories in the wildlife domain are scarce as a result of ethical and environmental constraints of the collection process. In this paper, we consider the problem of generating long-horizon trajectories, akin to wildlife migration, based on a small set of real samples. We propose a hierarchical approach to learn the global movement characteristics of the real dataset and recursively refine localized regions. Our solution, WildGraph, discretizes the geographic path into a prototype network of H3 (https://www.uber.com/blog/h3/) regions and leverages a recurrent variational auto-encoder to probabilistically generate paths over the regions, based on occupancy. WildGraph successfully generates realistic months-long trajectories using a sample size as small as 60. Experiments performed on two wildlife migration datasets demonstrate that our proposed method improves the generalization of the generated trajectories in comparison to existing work while achieving superior or comparable performance in several benchmark metrics.

Previous methods on controllable video generation primarily leverage 2D control signals to manipulate object motions and have achieved remarkable synthesis results. However, 2D control signals are inherently limited in expressing the 3D nature of object motions. To overcome this problem, we introduce 3DTrajMaster, a robust controller that regulates multi-entity dynamics in 3D space, given user-desired 6DoF pose (location and rotation) sequences of entities. At the core of our approach is a plug-and-play 3D-motion grounded object injector that fuses multiple input entities with their respective 3D trajectories through a gated self-attention mechanism. In addition, we exploit an injector architecture to preserve the video diffusion prior, which is crucial for generalization ability. To mitigate video quality degradation, we introduce a domain adaptor during training and employ an annealed sampling strategy during inference. To address the lack of suitable training data, we construct a 360-Motion Dataset, which first correlates collected 3D human and animal assets with GPT-generated trajectory and then captures their motion with 12 evenly-surround cameras on diverse 3D UE platforms. Extensive experiments show that 3DTrajMaster sets a new state-of-the-art in both accuracy and generalization for controlling multi-entity 3D motions.

Despite growing interest, recent approaches often struggle with two major challenges: multi-dancer collisions and single-dancer foot sliding. To address these challenges, we propose a Trajectory-Controllable Diffusion (TCDiff) framework, which leverages non-overlapping trajectories to ensure coherent and aesthetically pleasing dance movements. To mitigate collisions, we introduce a Dance-Trajectory Navigator that generates collision-free trajectories for multiple dancers, utilizing a distance-consistency loss to maintain optimal spacing. Furthermore, to reduce foot sliding, we present a footwork adaptor that adjusts trajectory displacement between frames, supported by a relative forward-kinematic loss to further reinforce the correlation between movements and trajectories. Experiments demonstrate our method's superiority.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods typically require centralized data collection, which poses significant privacy and communication challenges. In this work, we introduce a novel Federated Temporal Graph Clustering (FTGC) framework that enables decentralized training of graph neural networks (GNNs) across multiple clients, ensuring data privacy throughout the process. Our approach incorporates a temporal aggregation mechanism to effectively capture the evolution of graph structures over time and a federated optimization strategy to collaboratively learn high-quality clustering representations. By preserving data privacy and reducing communication overhead, our framework achieves competitive performance on temporal graph datasets, making it a promising solution for privacy-sensitive, real-world applications involving dynamic data.</p></details> | 8 pages, 1 figure |

Thus, deriving robustness certificates is important to guarantee that test predictions remain unaffected and to understand worst-case robustness behavior. However, for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the problem of certifying label flipping has so far been unsolved. We change this by introducing an exact certification method, deriving both sample-wise and collective certificates. Our method leverages the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) to capture the training dynamics of wide networks enabling us to reformulate the bilevel optimization problem representing label flipping into a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP). We apply our method to certify a broad range of GNN architectures in node classification tasks. Thereby, concerning the worst-case robustness to label flipping: $(i)$ we establish hierarchies of GNNs on different benchmark graphs; $(ii)$ quantify the effect of architectural choices such as activations, depth and skip-connections; and surprisingly, $(iii)$ uncover a novel phenomenon of the robustness plateauing for intermediate perturbation budgets across all investigated datasets and architectures. While we focus on GNNs, our certificates are applicable to sufficiently wide NNs in general through their NTK. Thus, our work presents the first exact certificate to a poisoning attack ever derived for neural networks, which could be of independent interest. The code is available at https://github.com/saper0/qpcert.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a spotlight presentation at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods, which typically rely on single experiments, often reach a performance bottleneck and face limitations in handling diverse interference structures. In contrast, we propose leveraging multiple experiments to overcome these limitations. In industry, the use of sequential experiments, often known as the ramp-up process, where traffic to the treatment gradually increases, is common due to operational needs like risk management and cost control. Our approach shifts the focus from operational aspects to the statistical advantages of merging data from multiple experiments. By combining data from sequentially conducted experiments, we aim to estimate the global average treatment effect more effectively. In this paper, we begin by analyzing the bias and variance of the linear regression estimator for GATE under general linear network interference. We demonstrate that bias plays a dominant role in the bias-variance tradeoff and highlight the intrinsic bias reduction achieved by merging data from experiments with strictly different treatment proportions. Herein the improvement introduced by merging two steps of experimental data is essential. In addition, we show that merging more steps of experimental data is unnecessary under general linear interference, while it can become beneficial when nonlinear interference occurs. Furthermore, we look into a more advanced estimator based on graph neural networks. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that the regression-based estimator benefits remarkably from training on merged experiment data, achieving outstanding statistical performance.</p></details> |  |

However, the general applicability of these encodings and their potential to serve as foundational representations for graphs remain uncertain. This paper investigates the fine-tuning efficiency, scalability with sample size, and generalization capability of learnable PSEs across diverse graph datasets. Specifically, we evaluate their potential as universal pre-trained models that can be easily adapted to new tasks with minimal fine-tuning and limited data. Furthermore, we assess the expressivity of the learned representations, particularly, when used to augment downstream GNNs. We demonstrate through extensive benchmarking and empirical analysis that PSEs generally enhance downstream models. However, some datasets may require specific PSE-augmentations to achieve optimal performance. Nevertheless, our findings highlight their significant potential to become integral components of future graph foundation models. We provide new insights into the strengths and limitations of PSEs, contributing to the broader discourse on foundation models in graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at TMLR (https://openreview.net/forum?id=mSoDRZXsqj)</p></details> |

For dynamic graph modeling, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a mainstream technique. However, they are generally pre-trained on the link prediction task, leaving a significant gap from the objectives of downstream tasks such as node classification. To bridge the gap, prompt-based learning has gained traction on graphs, but most existing efforts focus on static graphs, neglecting the evolution of dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose DYGPROMPT, a novel pre-training and prompt learning framework for dynamic graph modeling. First, we design dual prompts to address the gap in both task objectives and temporal variations across pre-training and downstream tasks. Second, we recognize that node and time features mutually characterize each other, and propose dual condition-nets to model the evolving node-time patterns in downstream tasks. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate and analyze DYGPROMPT through extensive experiments on four public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods ignore a tree hierarchy among metapaths, naturally constituted by different node types and relation types. In this paper, we present HetTree, a novel HGNN that models both the graph structure and heterogeneous aspects in a scalable and effective manner. Specifically, HetTree builds a semantic tree data structure to capture the hierarchy among metapaths. To effectively encode the semantic tree, HetTree uses a novel subtree attention mechanism to emphasize metapaths that are more helpful in encoding parent-child relationships. Moreover, HetTree proposes carefully matching pre-computed features and labels correspondingly, constituting a complete metapath representation. Our evaluation of HetTree on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrates that it outperforms all existing baselines on open benchmarks and efficiently scales to large real-world graphs with millions of nodes and edges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

KANs have already been integrated into various architectures, such as convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks, and transformers, and their potential has been assessed for predicting physical quantities. However, the combination of KANs with point-cloud-based neural networks (e.g., PointNet) for computational physics has not yet been explored. To address this, we present Kolmogorov-Arnold PointNet (KA-PointNet) as a novel supervised deep learning framework for the prediction of incompressible steady-state fluid flow fields in irregular domains, where the predicted fields are a function of the geometry of the domains. In KA-PointNet, we implement shared KANs in the segmentation branch of the PointNet architecture. We utilize Jacobi polynomials to construct shared KANs. As a benchmark test case, we consider incompressible laminar steady-state flow over a cylinder, where the geometry of its cross-section varies over the data set. We investigate the performance of Jacobi polynomials with different degrees as well as special cases of Jacobi polynomials such as Legendre polynomials, Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kinds, and Gegenbauer polynomials, in terms of the computational cost of training and accuracy of prediction of the test set. Additionally, we compare the performance of PointNet with shared KANs (i.e., KA-PointNet) and PointNet with shared MLPs. It is observed that when the number of trainable parameters is approximately equal, PointNet with shared KANs (i.e., KA-PointNet) outperforms PointNet with shared MLPs. Moreover, KA-PointNet predicts the pressure and velocity distributions along the surface of cylinders more accurately, resulting in more precise computations of lift and drag.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods often overlook the critical importance of preserving symmetry when generating scene graphs from 3D point clouds, which can lead to reduced accuracy and robustness, particularly when dealing with noisy, multi-view data. Furthermore, a major limitation of prior approaches is the lack of temporal modeling to capture time-dependent relationships among dynamically evolving entities in a scene. To address these challenges, we propose Temporal Equivariant Scene Graph Neural Network (TESGNN), consisting of two key components: (1) an Equivariant Scene Graph Neural Network (ESGNN), which extracts information from 3D point clouds to generate scene graph while preserving crucial symmetry properties, and (2) a Temporal Graph Matching Network, which fuses scene graphs generated by ESGNN across multiple time sequences into a unified global representation using an approximate graph-matching algorithm. Our combined architecture TESGNN outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in scene graph generation, achieving higher accuracy and faster training convergence. Moreover, we show that leveraging the symmetry-preserving property produces a more stable and accurate global scene representation compared to existing approaches. Last but not least, it is computationally efficient and easily implementable using existing frameworks, making it well-suited for real-time applications in robotics and computer vision. This approach paves the way for more robust and scalable solutions to complex multi-view scene understanding challenges.

Yet, the ability of GNNs to capture structural interactions within graphs remains under-explored. In this work, we address this gap by drawing on the insight that permutation invariant graph partitioning enables a powerful way of exploring structural interactions. We establish theoretical connections between permutation invariant graph partitioning and graph isomorphism, and then propose Graph Partitioning Neural Networks (GPNNs), a novel architecture that efficiently enhances the expressive power of GNNs in learning structural interactions. We analyze how partitioning schemes and structural interactions contribute to GNN expressivity and their trade-offs with complexity. Empirically, we demonstrate that GPNNs outperform existing GNN models in capturing structural interactions across diverse graph benchmark tasks.</p></details> |  |

It creates a significant barrier in transferring the acquired knowledge to different, heterogeneous data setups. This paper introduces GraphBridge, a novel framework to enable knowledge transfer across disparate tasks and domains in GNNs, circumventing the need for modifications to task configurations or graph structures. Specifically, GraphBridge allows for the augmentation of any pre-trained GNN with prediction heads and a bridging network that connects the input to the output layer. This architecture not only preserves the intrinsic knowledge of the original model but also supports outputs of arbitrary dimensions. To mitigate the negative transfer problem, GraphBridge merges the source model with a concurrently trained model, thereby reducing the source bias when applied to the target domain. Our method is thoroughly evaluated across diverse transfer learning scenarios, including Graph2Graph, Node2Node, Graph2Node, and graph2point-cloud. Empirical validation, conducted over 16 datasets representative of these scenarios, confirms the framework's capacity for task- and domain-agnostic transfer learning within graph-like data, marking a significant advancement in the field of GNNs.

One key challenge in enhancing graph transformers is strengthening the discriminative power of distinguishing isomorphisms of graphs, which plays a crucial role in boosting their predictive performances. To address this challenge, we introduce 'Topology-Informed Graph Transformer (TIGT)', a novel transformer enhancing both discriminative power in detecting graph isomorphisms and the overall performance of Graph Transformers. TIGT consists of four components: A topological positional embedding layer using non-isomorphic universal covers based on cyclic subgraphs of graphs to ensure unique graph representation: A dual-path message-passing layer to explicitly encode topological characteristics throughout the encoder layers: A global attention mechanism: And a graph information layer to recalibrate channel-wise graph features for better feature representation. TIGT outperforms previous Graph Transformers in classifying synthetic dataset aimed at distinguishing isomorphism classes of graphs.

As opposed to conventional frame-based vision sensors, event-based cameras deliver a microsecond-scale temporal resolution with sparse information encoding, thereby outlining new opportunities for edge vision systems. However, mainstream algorithms for frame-based vision, which mostly rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can hardly exploit the advantages of event-based vision as they are typically optimized for dense matrix-vector multiplications. While event-driven graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as a promising solution for sparse event-based vision, their irregular structure is a challenge that currently hinders the design of efficient hardware accelerators. In this paper, we propose EvGNN, the first event-driven GNN accelerator for low-footprint, ultra-low-latency, and high-accuracy edge vision with event-based cameras. It relies on three central ideas: (i) directed dynamic graphs exploiting single-hop nodes with edge-free storage, (ii) event queues for the efficient identification of local neighbors within a spatiotemporally decoupled search range, and (iii) a novel layer-parallel processing scheme allowing for a low-latency execution of multi-layer GNNs. We deployed EvGNN on a Xilinx KV260 Ultrascale+ MPSoC platform and benchmarked it on the N-CARS dataset for car recognition, demonstrating a classification accuracy of 87.8% and an average latency per event of 16$\mu$s, thereby enabling real-time, microsecond-resolution event-based vision at the edge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Artificial Intelligence, 2025. 14 pages, 14 figures</p></details> |
| **[Improving Graph Neural Networks by Learning Continuous Edge Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14109v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) traditionally employ a message-passing mechanism that resembles diffusion over undirected graphs, which often leads to homogenization of node features and reduced discriminative power in tasks such as node classification. Our key insight for addressing this limitation is to assign fuzzy edge directions -- that can vary continuously from node $i$ pointing to node $j$ to vice versa -- to the edges of a graph so that features can preferentially flow in one direction between nodes to enable long-range information transmission across the graph. We also introduce a novel complex-valued Laplacian for directed graphs with fuzzy edges where the real and imaginary parts represent information flow in opposite directions. Using this Laplacian, we propose a general framework, called Continuous Edge Direction (CoED) GNN, for learning on graphs with fuzzy edges and prove its expressivity limits using a generalization of the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) graph isomorphism test for directed graphs with fuzzy edges. Our architecture aggregates neighbor features scaled by the learned edge directions and processes the aggregated messages from in-neighbors and out-neighbors separately alongside the self-features of the nodes. Since continuous edge directions are differentiable, they can be learned jointly with the GNN weights via gradient-based optimization. CoED GNN is particularly well-suited for graph ensemble data where the graph structure remains fixed but multiple realizations of node features are available, such as in gene regulatory networks, web connectivity graphs, and power grids. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real graph ensemble datasets that learning continuous edge directions significantly improves performance both for undirected and directed graphs compared with existing methods.</p></details> |  |

The use of custom hardware architectures proves particularly beneficial for GNNs due to their irregular memory access patterns, resulting from the sparse structure of graphs. However, existing FPGA accelerators are limited by their double buffering mechanism, which doesn't account for the irregular node distribution in typical graph datasets. To address this, we introduce \textbf{AMPLE} (Accelerated Message Passing Logic Engine), an FPGA accelerator leveraging a new event-driven programming flow. We develop a mixed-arithmetic architecture, enabling GNN inference to be quantized at a node-level granularity. Finally, prefetcher for data and instructions is implemented to optimize off-chip memory access and maximize node parallelism. Evaluation on citation and social media graph datasets ranging from $2$K to $700$K nodes showed a mean speedup of $243\times$ and $7.2\times$ against CPU and GPU counterparts, respectively.</p></details> |  |

GNN transferability allows training on smaller graphs and applying the model to larger ones, but existing methods often rely on random subsampling, leading to disconnected subgraphs and reduced model expressivity. We propose a novel graph sampling algorithm that leverages feature homophily to preserve graph structure. By minimizing the trace of the data correlation matrix, our method better preserves the graph Laplacian trace -- a proxy for the graph connectivity -- than random sampling, while achieving lower complexity than spectral methods. Experiments on citation networks show improved performance in preserving Laplacian trace and GNN transferability compared to random sampling.</p></details> |  |

In this way, node embeddings produced at the output layer dually serve as both predictive features for solving downstream tasks (e.g., node classification) and energy function minimizers that inherit transparent, exploitable inductive biases and interpretability. However, scaling GNN architectures constructed in this way remains challenging, in part because the convergence of the forward pass may involve models with considerable depth. To tackle this limitation, we propose a sampling-based energy function and scalable GNN layers that iteratively reduce it, guided by convergence guarantees in certain settings. We also instantiate a full GNN architecture based on these designs, and the model achieves competitive accuracy and scalability when applied to the largest publicly-available node classification benchmark exceeding 1TB in size.

However, as models scale, their limited capacity becomes a significant challenge for adapting to novel scenarios. It is increasingly difficult to improve models for new situations using a single monolithic model. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of dynamically enhancing a basic driving planner with local driving data, without permanently modifying the planner itself. This approach, termed the Dynamically Local-Enhancement (DLE) Planner, aims to improve the scalability of autonomous driving systems without significantly expanding the planner's size. Our approach introduces a position-varying Markov Decision Process formulation coupled with a graph neural network that extracts region-specific driving features from local observation data. The learned features describe the local behavior of the surrounding objects, which is then leveraged to enhance a basic reinforcement learning-based policy. We evaluated our approach in multiple scenarios and compared it with a one-for-all driving model. The results show that our method outperforms the baseline policy in both safety (collision rate) and average reward, while maintaining a lighter scale. This approach has the potential to benefit large-scale autonomous vehicles without the need for largely expanding on-device driving models.</p></details> |  |

Oversquashing is attributed to the exponential decay in information transmission as node distances increase. This paper introduces a novel perspective to address oversquashing, leveraging dynamical systems properties of global and local non-dissipativity, that enable the maintenance of a constant information flow rate. We present SWAN, a uniquely parameterized GNN model with antisymmetry both in space and weight domains, as a means to obtain non-dissipativity. Our theoretical analysis asserts that by implementing these properties, SWAN offers an enhanced ability to transmit information over extended distances. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world benchmarks that emphasize long-range interactions validate the theoretical understanding of SWAN, and its ability to mitigate oversquashing.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

Many existing machine learning models struggle to provide comprehensive interpretability, often failing to extract meaningful biomarkers from imaging data, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), or lacking mechanisms to explain the significance of non-imaging data. In this paper, we propose the Interpretable Information Bottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (I2B-HGNN), a novel framework designed to learn from fine-grained local patterns to comprehensive global multi-modal interactions. This framework comprises two key modules. The first module, the Information Bottleneck Graph Transformer (IBGraphFormer) for local patterns, integrates global modeling with brain connectomic-constrained graph neural networks to identify biomarkers through information bottleneck-guided pooling. The second module, the Information Bottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (IB-HGAN) for global multi-modal interactions, facilitates interpretable multi-modal fusion of imaging and non-imaging data using heterogeneous graph neural networks. The results of the experiments demonstrate that I2B-HGNN excels in diagnosing NDDs with high accuracy, providing interpretable biomarker identification and effective analysis of non-imaging data.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Quaternion Message Passing Neural Networks (QMPNNs), a framework that leverages quaternion space to compute node representations. Our approach offers a generalizable method for incorporating quaternion representations into GNN architectures at one-fourth of the original parameter count. Furthermore, we present a novel perspective on Graph Lottery Tickets, redefining their applicability within the context of GNNs and QMPNNs. We specifically aim to find the initialization lottery from the subnetwork of the GNNs that can achieve comparable performance to the original GNN upon training. Thereby reducing the trainable model parameters even further. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed QMPNN framework and LTH for both GNNs and QMPNNs, we evaluate their performance on real-world datasets across three fundamental graph-based tasks: node classification, link prediction, and graph classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, accepted at PAKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Generating Clinically Realistic EHR Data via a Hierarchy- and Semantics-Guided Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20719v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating realistic synthetic electronic health records (EHRs) holds tremendous promise for accelerating healthcare research, facilitating AI model development and enhancing patient privacy. However, existing generative methods typically treat EHRs as flat sequences of discrete medical codes. This approach overlooks two critical aspects: the inherent hierarchical organization of clinical coding systems and the rich semantic context provided by code descriptions. Consequently, synthetic patient sequences often lack high clinical fidelity and have limited utility in downstream clinical tasks. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchy- and Semantics-Guided Transformer (HiSGT), a novel framework that leverages both hierarchical and semantic information for the generative process. HiSGT constructs a hierarchical graph to encode parent-child and sibling relationships among clinical codes and employs a graph neural network to derive hierarchy-aware embeddings. These are then fused with semantic embeddings extracted from a pre-trained clinical language model (e.g., ClinicalBERT), enabling the Transformer-based generator to more accurately model the nuanced clinical patterns inherent in real EHRs. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that HiSGT significantly improves the statistical alignment of synthetic data with real patient records, as well as supports robust downstream applications such as chronic disease classification. By addressing the limitations of conventional raw code-based generative models, HiSGT represents a significant step toward clinically high-fidelity synthetic data generation and a general paradigm suitable for interpretable medical code representation, offering valuable applications in data augmentation and privacy-preserving healthcare analytics.</p></details> |  |

We focus on reasoning in relational domains, where the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) seems like a natural choice. However, previous work has shown that regular GNNs lack the ability to systematically generalize from training examples on test graphs requiring longer inference chains, which fundamentally limits their reasoning abilities. A common solution relies on neuro-symbolic methods that systematically reason by learning rules, but their scalability is often limited and they tend to make unrealistically strong assumptions, e.g.\ that the answer can always be inferred from a single relational path. We propose the Epistemic GNN (EpiGNN), a novel parameter-efficient and scalable GNN architecture with an epistemic inductive bias for systematic reasoning. Node embeddings in EpiGNNs are treated as epistemic states, and message passing is implemented accordingly. We show that EpiGNNs achieve state-of-the-art results on link prediction tasks that require systematic reasoning. Furthermore, for inductive knowledge graph completion, EpiGNNs rival the performance of state-of-the-art specialized approaches. Finally, we introduce two new benchmarks that go beyond standard relational reasoning by requiring the aggregation of information from multiple paths. Here, existing neuro-symbolic approaches fail, yet EpiGNNs learn to reason accurately.

However, learnable update rules can be costly and unstable to train and use. Recently, Jang et al. (2023) proposed a simpler approach to accelerate training based on weight nowcaster networks (WNNs). In their approach, Adam is used for most of the optimization steps and periodically, only every few steps, a WNN nowcasts (predicts near future) parameters. We improve WNNs by proposing neuron interaction and nowcasting (NiNo) networks. In contrast to WNNs, NiNo leverages neuron connectivity and graph neural networks to more accurately nowcast parameters. We further show that in some networks, such as Transformers, modeling neuron connectivity accurately is challenging. We address this and other limitations, which allows NiNo to accelerate Adam training by up to 50% in vision and language tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025, code is https://github.com/SamsungSAILMontreal/nino</p></details> |

Traditional methods, which often rely on static parameters, struggle to adapt to changing environments. This paper proposes a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for state representation to address these limitations. Our approach redefines the action space by parameterizing heuristic inventory control policies, making it adaptive as the parameters dynamically adjust based on system conditions. By leveraging the inherent graph structure of supply chains, our framework enables agents to learn the system's topology, and we employ a centralized learning, decentralized execution scheme that allows agents to learn collaboratively while overcoming information-sharing constraints. Additionally, we incorporate global mean pooling and regularization techniques to enhance performance. We test the capabilities of our proposed approach on four different supply chain configurations and conduct a sensitivity analysis. This work paves the way for utilizing MARL-GNN frameworks to improve inventory management in complex, decentralized supply chain environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sustainable Greenhouse Management: A Comparative Analysis of Recurrent and Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17371v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems into greenhouses not only optimizes land use but also enhances sustainable agricultural practices by enabling dual benefits of food production and renewable energy generation. However, accurate prediction of internal environmental conditions is crucial to ensure optimal crop growth while maximizing energy production. This study introduces a novel application of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) to greenhouse microclimate modeling, comparing their performance with traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). While RNNs excel at temporal pattern recognition, they cannot explicitly model the directional relationships between environmental variables. Our STGNN approach addresses this limitation by representing these relationships as directed graphs, enabling the model to capture both spatial dependencies and their directionality. Using high-frequency data collected at 15-minute intervals from a greenhouse in Volos, Greece, we demonstrate that RNNs achieve exceptional accuracy in winter conditions (R^2 = 0.985) but show limitations during summer cooling system operation. Though STGNNs currently show lower performance (winter R^2 = 0.947), their architecture offers greater potential for integrating additional variables such as PV generation and crop growth indicators.</p></details> |  |

Despite its potential to advance diverse research fields like social networks and e-commerce, MAG representation learning (MAGRL) remains underexplored due to the lack of standardized datasets and evaluation frameworks. In this paper, we first propose MAGB, a comprehensive MAG benchmark dataset, featuring curated graphs from various domains with both textual and visual attributes. Based on MAGB dataset, we further systematically evaluate two mainstream MAGRL paradigms: $\textit{GNN-as-Predictor}$, which integrates multimodal attributes via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and $\textit{VLM-as-Predictor}$, which harnesses Vision Language Models (VLMs) for zero-shot reasoning. Extensive experiments on MAGB reveal following critical insights: $\textit{(i)}$ Modality significances fluctuate drastically with specific domain characteristics. $\textit{(ii)}$ Multimodal embeddings can elevate the performance ceiling of GNNs. However, intrinsic biases among modalities may impede effective training, particularly in low-data scenarios. $\textit{(iii)}$ VLMs are highly effective at generating multimodal embeddings that alleviate the imbalance between textual and visual attributes. These discoveries, which illuminate the synergy between multimodal attributes and graph topologies, contribute to reliable benchmarks, paving the way for future MAG research.

A critical step in this process is identifying pixel-to-point correspondences between 2D query images and 3D models. Most advanced approaches currently rely on extensive visual descriptors to establish these correspondences, facing challenges in storage, privacy issues and model maintenance. Direct 2D-3D keypoint matching without visual descriptors is becoming popular as it can overcome those challenges. However, existing descriptor-free methods suffer from low accuracy or heavy computation. Addressing this gap, this paper introduces the Angle-Annular Graph Neural Network (A2-GNN), a simple approach that efficiently learns robust geometric structural representations with annular feature extraction. Specifically, this approach clusters neighbors and embeds each group's distance information and angle as supplementary information to capture local structures. Evaluation on matching and visual localization datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with low computational overhead among visual description-free methods.

One such approach, GNNAutoScale (GAS), uses graph partitioning to enable training under constrained GPU memory. GAS also stores historical embedding vectors, which are retrieved from one-hop neighbors in other partitions, ensuring critical information is captured across partition boundaries. The historical embeddings which come from the previous training iteration are stale compared to the GAS estimated embeddings, resulting in approximation errors of the training algorithm. Furthermore, these errors accumulate over multiple layers, leading to suboptimal node embeddings. To address this shortcoming, we propose two enhancements: first, WaveGAS, inspired by waveform relaxation, performs multiple forward passes within GAS before the backward pass, refining the approximation of historical embeddings and gradients to improve accuracy; second, a gradient-tracking method that stores and utilizes more accurate historical gradients during training. Empirical results show that WaveGAS enhances GAS and achieves better accuracy, even outperforming methods that train on full graphs, thanks to its robust estimation of node embeddings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient and Universal Neural-Network Decoder for Stabilizer-Based Quantum Error Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19971v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum error correction is crucial for large-scale quantum computing, but the absence of efficient decoders for new codes like quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes has hindered progress. Here we introduce a universal decoder based on linear attention sequence modeling and graph neural network that operates directly on any stabilizer code's graph structure. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that this decoder outperforms specialized algorithms in both accuracy and speed across diverse stabilizer codes, including surface codes, color codes, and QLDPC codes. The decoder maintains linear time scaling with syndrome measurements and requires no structural modifications between different codes. For the Bivariate Bicycle code with distance 12, our approach achieves a 39.4% lower logical error rate than previous best decoders while requiring only ~1% of the decoding time. These results provide a practical, universal solution for quantum error correction, eliminating the need for code-specific decoders.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly through Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have significantly enhanced the accuracy of these forecasts by capturing complex spatio-temporal dynamics. However, the scalability of GNNs remains a challenge due to their exponential growth in model complexity with increasing nodes in the graph. Existing methods to address this issue, including sparsification, decomposition, and kernel-based approaches, either do not fully resolve the complexity issue or risk compromising predictive accuracy. This paper introduces GraphSparseNet (GSNet), a novel framework designed to improve both the scalability and accuracy of GNN-based traffic forecasting models. GraphSparseNet is comprised of two core modules: the Feature Extractor and the Relational Compressor. These modules operate with linear time and space complexity, thereby reducing the overall computational complexity of the model to a linear scale. Our extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that GraphSparseNet not only significantly reduces training time by 3.51x compared to state-of-the-art linear models but also maintains high predictive performance.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have proposed diverse architectures, enhanced explainability, and practical applications for Graph Transformers. In light of these rapid developments, we conduct a comprehensive review of Graph Transformers, covering aspects such as their architectures, theoretical foundations, and applications within this survey. We categorize the architecture of Graph Transformers according to their strategies for processing structural information, including graph tokenization, positional encoding, structure-aware attention and model ensemble. Furthermore, from the theoretical perspective, we examine the expressivity of Graph Transformers in various discussed architectures and contrast them with other advanced graph learning algorithms to discover the connections. Furthermore, we provide a summary of the practical applications where Graph Transformers have been utilized, such as molecule, protein, language, vision, traffic, brain and material data. At the end of this survey, we will discuss the current challenges and prospective directions in Graph Transformers for potential future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accurate and Scalable Graph Neural Networks via Message Invariance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19693v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message passing-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in many real-world applications. For a sampled mini-batch of target nodes, the message passing process is divided into two parts: message passing between nodes within the batch (MP-IB) and message passing from nodes outside the batch to those within it (MP-OB). However, MP-OB recursively relies on higher-order out-of-batch neighbors, leading to an exponentially growing computational cost with respect to the number of layers. Due to the neighbor explosion, the whole message passing stores most nodes and edges on the GPU such that many GNNs are infeasible to large-scale graphs. To address this challenge, we propose an accurate and fast mini-batch approach for large graph transductive learning, namely topological compensation (TOP), which obtains the outputs of the whole message passing solely through MP-IB, without the costly MP-OB. The major pillar of TOP is a novel concept of message invariance, which defines message-invariant transformations to convert costly MP-OB into fast MP-IB. This ensures that the modified MP-IB has the same output as the whole message passing. Experiments demonstrate that TOP is significantly faster than existing mini-batch methods by order of magnitude on vast graphs (millions of nodes and billions of edges) with limited accuracy degradation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training Robust Graph Neural Networks by Modeling Noise Dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19670v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world applications, node features in graphs often contain noise from various sources, leading to significant performance degradation in GNNs. Although several methods have been developed to enhance robustness, they rely on the unrealistic assumption that noise in node features is independent of the graph structure and node labels, thereby limiting their applicability. To this end, we introduce a more realistic noise scenario, dependency-aware noise on graphs (DANG), where noise in node features create a chain of noise dependencies that propagates to the graph structure and node labels. We propose a novel robust GNN, DA-GNN, which captures the causal relationships among variables in the data generating process (DGP) of DANG using variational inference. In addition, we present new benchmark datasets that simulate DANG in real-world applications, enabling more practical research on robust GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DA-GNN consistently outperforms existing baselines across various noise scenarios, including both DANG and conventional noise models commonly considered in this field.</p></details> | Work in progress |

HDGL maps node features into a very high-dimensional space (\textit{hyperdimensional} or HD space for short) using the \emph{injectivity} property of node representations in a family of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and then uses HD operators such as \textit{bundling} and \textit{binding} to aggregate information from the local neighborhood of each node yielding latent node representations that can support both node classification and link prediction tasks. HDGL, unlike GNNs that rely on computationally expensive iterative optimization and hyperparameter tuning, requires only a single pass through the data set. We report results of experiments using widely used benchmark datasets which demonstrate that, on the node classification task, HDGL achieves accuracy that is competitive with that of the state-of-the-art GNN methods at substantially reduced computational cost; and on the link prediction task, HDGL matches the performance of DeepWalk and related methods, although it falls short of computationally demanding state-of-the-art GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WSDM 2025</p></details> |

While exact solutions are often not necessary, many applications require finding high-quality solutions quickly. For this purpose, we propose a data-driven approach to improve existing non-learned approximation algorithms for CO. We parameterize the approximation algorithm and train a graph neural network (GNN) to predict parameter values that lead to the best possible solutions. Our pipeline is trained end-to-end in a self-supervised fashion using gradient estimation, treating the approximation algorithm as a black box. We propose a novel gradient estimation scheme for this purpose, which we call preference-based gradient estimation. Our approach combines the benefits of the neural network and the non-learned approximation algorithm: The GNN leverages the information from the dataset to allow the approximation algorithm to find better solutions, while the approximation algorithm guarantees that the solution is feasible. We validate our approach on two well-known combinatorial optimization problems, the travelling salesman problem and the minimum k-cut problem, and show that our method is competitive with state of the art learned CO solvers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary work, under review</p></details> |

Existing techniques neglect this issue or only distinguish between structure-aware and structure-agnostic uncertainty without combining them into a single measure. We propose GEBM, an energy-based model (EBM) that provides high-quality uncertainty estimates by aggregating energy at different structural levels that naturally arise from graph diffusion. In contrast to logit-based EBMs, we provably induce an integrable density in the data space by regularizing the energy function. We introduce an evidential interpretation of our EBM that significantly improves the predictive robustness of the GNN. Our framework is a simple and effective post hoc method applicable to any pre-trained GNN that is sensitive to various distribution shifts. It consistently achieves the best separation of in-distribution and out-of-distribution data on 6 out of 7 anomaly types while having the best average rank over shifts on \emph{all} datasets.</p></details> |  |

Quantum capability learning with physics-aware neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05636v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize diverse fields, including quantum chemistry, materials science, and machine learning. However, contemporary quantum computers experience errors that often cause quantum programs run on them to fail. Until quantum computers can reliably execute large quantum programs, stakeholders will need fast and reliable methods for assessing a quantum computer's capability-i.e., the programs it can run and how well it can run them. Previously, off-the-shelf neural network architectures have been used to model quantum computers' capabilities, but with limited success, because these networks fail to learn the complex quantum physics that determines real quantum computers' errors. We address this shortcoming with a new quantum-physics-aware neural network architecture for learning capability models. Our architecture combines aspects of graph neural networks with efficient approximations to the physics of errors in quantum programs. This approach achieves up to $\sim50\%$ reductions in mean absolute error on both experimental and simulated data, over state-of-the-art models based on convolutional neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables, includes conference checklist</p></details> |

Decentralized controller design has been inspired by self-organization found in nature, with a prominent source of inspiration being flocking; however, decentralized controllers struggle to maintain flock cohesion. The graph neural network (GNN) architecture has emerged as an indispensable machine learning tool for developing decentralized controllers capable of maintaining flock cohesion, but they fail to exploit the symmetries present in flocking dynamics, hindering their generalizability. We enforce rotation equivariance and translation invariance symmetries in decentralized flocking GNN controllers and achieve comparable flocking control with 70% less training data and 75% fewer trainable weights than existing GNN controllers without these symmetries enforced. We also show that our symmetry-aware controller generalizes better than existing GNN controllers.

However, most convolutional neural network-based methods typically focus on a single scale, neglecting the incorporation of multi-scale information. In image restoration tasks, local features of an image are often insufficient, necessitating the integration of global features to complement them. Although recent neural network algorithms have made significant strides in feature extraction, many models do not explicitly model global features or consider the relationship between global and local features. This paper proposes multi-level attention-guided graph neural network. The proposed network explicitly constructs element block graphs and element graphs within feature maps using multi-attention mechanisms to extract both local structural features and global representation information of the image. Since the network struggles to effectively extract global information during image degradation, the structural information of local feature blocks can be used to correct and supplement the global information. Similarly, when element block information in the feature map is missing, it can be refined using global element representation information. The graph within the network learns real-time dynamic connections through the multi-attention mechanism, and information is propagated and aggregated via graph convolution algorithms. By combining local element block information and global element representation information from the feature map, the algorithm can more effectively restore missing information in the image. Experimental results on several classic image restoration tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

In this paper the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) embedded into a relatively simple excess Gibbs energy model, the extended Margules model, for predicting vapor-liquid equilibrium is analyzed. By comparing its performance against the established UNIFAC-Dortmund model it has been shown that GNNs embedded in Margules achieves an overall lower accuracy. However, higher accuracy is observed in the case of various types of binary mixtures. Moreover, since group contribution methods, like UNIFAC, are limited due to feasibility of molecular fragmentation or availability of parameters, the GNN in Margules model offers an alternative for VLE estimation. The findings establish a baseline for the predictive accuracy that simple excess Gibbs energy models combined with GNNs trained solely on infinite dilution data can achieve.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods may cause misalignment problem in the feature fusion process and counter-intuitive patches in the segmentation results. Inspired by the popular pixel-node-pixel pipeline, we propose to 1) fuse features from two modalities in a late fusion style, during which the geometric feature injection is guided by texture feature prior; 2) employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on the fused feature to alleviate the emergence of irregular patches by inferring patch relationship. At the 3D feature extraction stage, we argue that traditional CNNs are not efficient enough for depth maps. So, we encode depth map into normal map, after which CNNs can easily extract object surface tendencies.At projection matrix generation stage, we find the existence of Biased-Assignment and Ambiguous-Locality issues in the original pipeline. Therefore, we propose to 1) adopt the Kullback-Leibler Loss to ensure no missing important pixel features, which can be viewed as hard pixel mining process; 2) connect regions that are close to each other in the Euclidean space as well as in the semantic space with larger edge weights so that location informations can been considered. Extensive experiments on two public datasets, NYU-DepthV2 and SUN RGB-D, have shown that our approach can consistently boost the performance of RGB-D semantic segmentation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>I hav...</summary><p>I have decided to withdraw this paper because I have recently obtained some new data and insights during my ongoing research</p></details> |

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a mainstream technique for graph-based applications, but their performance heavily relies on abundant labeled data. To reduce labeling requirement, pre-training and prompt learning has become a popular alternative. However, most existing prompt methods do not differentiate homophilic and heterophilic characteristics of real-world graphs. In particular, many real-world graphs are non-homophilic, not strictly or uniformly homophilic with mixing homophilic and heterophilic patterns, exhibiting varying non-homophilic characteristics across graphs and nodes. In this paper, we propose ProNoG, a novel pre-training and prompt learning framework for such non-homophilic graphs. First, we analyze existing graph pre-training methods, providing theoretical insights into the choice of pre-training tasks. Second, recognizing that each node exhibits unique non-homophilic characteristics, we propose a conditional network to characterize the node-specific patterns in downstream tasks. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate and analyze ProNoG through extensive experiments on ten public datasets.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

We aim to design the active beamforming vectors at the base station (BS) and the passive beamforming at the STAR-RIS to maximize the user sum rate under transmitting power constraints. The formulated problem is non-convex and nontrivial to obtain the global optimum due to the coupling between active beamforming vectors and STAR-RIS phase shifts. To efficiently solve the problem, we propose a novel graph neural network (GNN)-based framework. Specifically, we first model the interactions among users and network entities are using a heterogeneous graph representation. A heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) implementation is then introduced to directly optimizes beamforming vectors and STAR-RIS coefficients with the system objective. Numerical results show that the proposed approach yields efficient performance compared to the previous benchmarks. Furthermore, the proposed GNN is scalable with various system configurations.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and molecular glue degraders (MGDs) are the primary small molecules that induce TPD. Both types of molecules form a ternary complex linking an E3 ligase with a target protein, a crucial step for drug discovery. While significant advances have been made in binary structure prediction for proteins and small molecules, ternary structure prediction remains challenging due to obscure interaction mechanisms and insufficient training data. Traditional methods relying on manually assigned rules perform poorly and are computationally demanding due to extensive random sampling. In this work, we introduce DeepTernary, a novel deep learning-based approach that directly predicts ternary structures in an end-to-end manner using an encoder-decoder architecture. DeepTernary leverages an SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network (GNN) with both intra-graph and ternary inter-graph attention mechanisms to capture intricate ternary interactions from our collected high-quality training dataset, TernaryDB. The proposed query-based Pocket Points Decoder extracts the 3D structure of the final binding ternary complex from learned ternary embeddings, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy and speed in existing PROTAC benchmarks without prior knowledge from known PROTACs. It also achieves notable accuracy on the more challenging MGD benchmark under the blind docking protocol. Remarkably, our experiments reveal that the buried surface area calculated from predicted structures correlates with experimentally obtained degradation potency-related metrics. Consequently, DeepTernary shows potential in effectively assisting and accelerating the development of TPDs for previously undruggable targets.</p></details> |  |

To address this, numerous temporal graph neural networks (temporal GNNs) and benchmark datasets have been developed. However, these datasets often feature excessive repeated edges and lack complex sequential dynamics, a key characteristic inherent in many real-world applications such as recommender systems and ``Who-To-Follow'' on social networks. This oversight has led existing methods to inadvertently downplay the importance of learning sequential dynamics, focusing primarily on predicting repeated edges. In this study, we demonstrate that existing methods, such as GraphMixer and DyGFormer, are inherently incapable of learning simple sequential dynamics, such as ``a user who has followed OpenAI and Anthropic is more likely to follow AI at Meta next.'' Motivated by this issue, we introduce the Temporal Graph Benchmark with Sequential Dynamics (TGB-Seq), a new benchmark carefully curated to minimize repeated edges, challenging models to learn sequential dynamics and generalize to unseen edges. TGB-Seq comprises large real-world datasets spanning diverse domains, including e-commerce interactions, movie ratings, business reviews, social networks, citation networks and web link networks. Benchmarking experiments reveal that current methods usually suffer significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs on TGB-Seq, posing new challenges and opportunities for future research.

While attention-based architectures and self-supervised learning have achieved notable success, their application to tabular data remains less effective over linear and tree based models. Although several breakthroughs have been achieved by models which transform tables into uni-modal transformations like image, language and graph, these models often underperform in the presence of feature heterogeneity. To address this gap, we introduce TabGLM (Tabular Graph Language Model), a novel multi-modal architecture designed to model both structural and semantic information from a table. TabGLM transforms each row of a table into a fully connected graph and serialized text, which are then encoded using a graph neural network (GNN) and a text encoder, respectively. By aligning these representations through a joint, multi-modal, self-supervised learning objective, TabGLM leverages complementary information from both modalities, thereby enhancing feature learning. TabGLM's flexible graph-text pipeline efficiently processes heterogeneous datasets with significantly fewer parameters over existing Deep Learning approaches. Evaluations across 25 benchmark datasets demonstrate substantial performance gains, with TabGLM achieving an average AUC-ROC improvement of up to 5.56% over State-of-the-Art (SoTA) tabular learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Traditional graph learning models like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have made significant strides, but their capabilities in handling graph data remain limited in certain contexts. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising candidates for graph tasks, yet most studies focus primarily on performance benchmarks and fail to address their broader potential, including their ability to handle limited data, their transferability across tasks, and their robustness. In this work, we provide a comprehensive exploration of LLMs applied to graph tasks. We evaluate the performance of pure LLMs, including those without parameter optimization and those fine-tuned with instructions, across various scenarios. Our analysis goes beyond accuracy, assessing LLM ability to perform in few-shot/zero-shot settings, transfer across domains, understand graph structures, and demonstrate robustness in challenging scenarios. We conduct extensive experiments with 16 graph learning models alongside 6 LLMs (e.g., Llama3B, GPT-4o, Qwen-plus), comparing their performance on datasets like Cora, PubMed, ArXiv, and Products. Our findings show that LLMs, particularly those with instruction tuning, outperform traditional models in few-shot settings, exhibit strong domain transferability, and demonstrate excellent generalization and robustness. This work offers valuable insights into the capabilities of LLMs for graph learning, highlighting their advantages and potential for real-world applications, and paving the way for future research in this area.

Attention Graphs aggregate attention matrices across Transformer layers and heads to describe how information flows among input nodes. Through experiments on homophilous and heterophilous node classification tasks, we analyze Attention Graphs from a network science perspective and find that: (1) When Graph Transformers are allowed to learn the optimal graph structure using all-to-all attention among input nodes, the Attention Graphs learned by the model do not tend to correlate with the input/original graph structure; and (2) For heterophilous graphs, different Graph Transformer variants can achieve similar performance while utilising distinct information flow patterns.

While Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (GNODEs) have shown promise in learning node representations, they lack the ability to quantify uncertainty. To address this, we introduce Latent Graph Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (LGNSDE), which enhance GNODE by embedding randomness through a Bayesian prior-posterior mechanism for epistemic uncertainty and Brownian motion for aleatoric uncertainty. By leveraging the existence and uniqueness of solutions to graph-based SDEs, we prove that the variance of the latent space bounds the variance of model outputs, thereby providing theoretically sensible guarantees for the uncertainty estimates. Furthermore, we show mathematically that LGNSDEs are robust to small perturbations in the input, maintaining stability over time. Empirical results across several benchmarks demonstrate that our framework is competitive in out-of-distribution detection, robustness to noise, and active learning, underscoring the ability of LGNSDEs to quantify uncertainty reliably.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025 as Spotlight. 17 pages including appendix</p></details> |

Nevertheless, current endeavors for cross-graph node classification mainly focus on model training. Data augmentation approaches, a simple and easy-to-implement domain generalization technique, remain under-explored. In this paper, we develop a new graph structure augmentation for the crossgraph domain generalization problem. Specifically, low-weight edgedropping is applied to remove potential noise edges that may hinder the generalization ability of GNNs, stimulating the GNNs to capture the essential invariant information underlying different structures. Meanwhile, clustering-based edge-adding is proposed to generate invariant structures based on the node features from the same distribution. Consequently, with these augmentation techniques, the GNNs can maintain the domain invariant structure information that can improve the generalization ability. The experiments on out-ofdistribution citation network datasets verify our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among conventional augmentations.</p></details> |  |

However, existing GNN methods struggle with the complexity of the heterogeneous graphs induced by databases with numerous tables and relations. Traditional approaches either consider all possible relational meta-paths, thus failing to scale with the number of relations, or rely on domain experts to identify relevant meta-paths. A recent solution does manage to learn informative meta-paths without expert supervision, but assumes that a node's class depends solely on the existence of a meta-path occurrence. In this work, we present a self-explainable heterogeneous GNN for relational data, that supports models in which class membership depends on aggregate information obtained from multiple occurrences of a meta-path. Experimental results show that in the context of relational databases, our approach effectively identifies informative meta-paths that faithfully capture the model's reasoning mechanisms. It significantly outperforms existing methods in both synthetic and real-world scenario.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we propose a lightweight graph neural network (GNN) model capable of capturing input- and component-specific vulnerability to soft errors. This model facilitates runtime vulnerability prediction, enabling an adaptive protection strategy that dynamically adjusts to varying vulnerabilities. The approach complements classical fault-tolerant techniques by tailoring protection efforts based on real-time vulnerability assessments. Experimental results across diverse datasets and NNs demonstrate that our adaptive protection method achieves a 42.12\% average reduction in computational overhead compared to prior static vulnerability-based approaches, without compromising reliability.</p></details> |  |

However, recognizing more targeted pathways, particularly when incorporating wet-lab experimental data, remains challenging and typically requires downstream biological analyses and expertise. In this paper, we frame this challenge as a solvable graph learning and explaining task and propose a novel pathway inference framework, ExPath, that explicitly integrates experimental data, specifically amino acid sequences (AA-seqs), to classify various graphs (bio-networks) in biological databases. The links (representing pathways) that contribute more to classification can be considered as targeted pathways. Technically, ExPath comprises three components: (1) a large protein language model (pLM) that encodes and embeds AA-seqs into graph, overcoming traditional obstacles in processing AA-seq data, such as BLAST; (2) PathMamba, a hybrid architecture combining graph neural networks (GNNs) with state-space sequence modeling (Mamba) to capture both local interactions and global pathway-level dependencies; and (3) PathExplainer, a subgraph learning module that identifies functionally critical nodes and edges through trainable pathway masks. We also propose ML-oriented biological evaluations and a new metric. The experiments involving 301 bio-networks evaluations demonstrate that pathways inferred by ExPath maintain biological meaningfulness. We will publicly release curated 301 bio-network data soon.</p></details> | Under review |

The majority of the existing approaches leverage deep learning models. While these approaches are effective, the rationale behind their outputs is opaque. Recently, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approaches emerged to provide intuitive explanations to the output of HAR models. To the best of our knowledge, these approaches leverage classic deep models like CNNs or RNNs. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) proved to be effective for sensor-based HAR. However, existing approaches are not designed with explainability in mind. In this work, we propose the first explainable Graph Neural Network explicitly designed for smart home HAR. Our results on two public datasets show that this approach provides better explanations than state-of-the-art methods while also slightly improving the recognition rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint.

We introduce gRNAde, a geometric RNA design pipeline operating on 3D RNA backbones to design sequences that explicitly account for structure and dynamics. gRNAde uses a multi-state Graph Neural Network and autoregressive decoding to generates candidate RNA sequences conditioned on one or more 3D backbone structures where the identities of the bases are unknown. On a single-state fixed backbone re-design benchmark of 14 RNA structures from the PDB identified by Das et al. (2010), gRNAde obtains higher native sequence recovery rates (56% on average) compared to Rosetta (45% on average), taking under a second to produce designs compared to the reported hours for Rosetta. We further demonstrate the utility of gRNAde on a new benchmark of multi-state design for structurally flexible RNAs, as well as zero-shot ranking of mutational fitness landscapes in a retrospective analysis of a recent ribozyme. Experimental wet lab validation on 10 different structured RNA backbones finds that gRNAde has a success rate of 50% at designing pseudoknotted RNA structures, a significant advance over 35% for Rosetta.

Traditional attack methodologies, which rely on manipulating the original graph or adding links to artificially created nodes, often prove impractical in real-world settings. This paper introduces a novel adversarial scenario involving the injection of an isolated subgraph to deceive both the link recommender and the node classifier within a GNN system. Specifically, the link recommender is mislead to propose links between targeted victim nodes and the subgraph, encouraging users to unintentionally establish connections and that would degrade the node classification accuracy, thereby facilitating a successful attack. To address this, we present the LiSA framework, which employs a dual surrogate model and bi-level optimization to simultaneously meet two adversarial objectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | PAKDD 2025 |

Although color fundus photographs (CFPs), combined with artificial intelligence (AI), have been extensively applied in detecting various eye diseases, including diabetic retinopathy (DR), their applications in detecting DMI remain unexplored, partly due to skepticism among ophthalmologists regarding its feasibility. In this study, we propose a graph neural network-based multispectral view learning (GNN-MSVL) model designed to detect DMI from CFPs. The model leverages higher spectral resolution to capture subtle changes in fundus reflectance caused by ischemic tissue, enhancing sensitivity to DMI-related features. The proposed approach begins with computational multispectral imaging (CMI) to reconstruct 24-wavelength multispectral fundus images from CFPs. ResNeXt101 is employed as the backbone for multi-view learning to extract features from the reconstructed images. Additionally, a GNN with a customized jumper connection strategy is designed to enhance cross-spectral relationships, facilitating comprehensive and efficient multispectral view learning. The study included a total of 1,078 macula-centered CFPs from 1,078 eyes of 592 patients with diabetes, of which 530 CFPs from 530 eyes of 300 patients were diagnosed with DMI. The model achieved an accuracy of 84.7 percent and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.900 (95 percent CI: 0.852-0.937) on eye-level, outperforming both the baseline model trained from CFPs and human experts (p-values less than 0.01). These findings suggest that AI-based CFP analysis holds promise for detecting DMI, contributing to its early and low-cost screening.</p></details> |  |

In parallel, retrieval-augmented generation has become a principled approach commonly used with language models. However, the optimal integration of retrieval augmentation into molecular machine learning remains unclear. Graph neural networks stand to benefit from clever matching to understand the structural alignment of retrieved molecules to a query molecule. Neural graph matching offers a compelling solution by explicitly modeling node and edge affinities between two structural graphs while employing a noise-robust, end-to-end neural network to learn affinity metrics. We apply this approach to mass spectrum simulation and introduce MARASON, a novel model that incorporates neural graph matching to enhance a fragmentation-based neural network. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our design, with MARASON achieving 28% top-1 accuracy, a substantial improvement over the non-retrieval state-of-the-art accuracy of 19%. Moreover, MARASON outperforms both naive retrieval-augmented generation methods and traditional graph matching approaches.</p></details> |  |

The asserted benefits are improved performance on a variety of graph tasks, node classification and link prediction included. Claims have also been made about the geometric suitability of particular hierarchical graph datasets to representation in hyperbolic space. Despite these claims, our work makes a surprising discovery: when simple Euclidean models with comparable numbers of parameters are properly trained in the same environment, in most cases, they perform as well, if not better, than all introduced hyperbolic graph representation learning models, even on graph datasets previously claimed to be the most hyperbolic as measured by Gromov $\delta$-hyperbolicity (i.e., perfect trees). This observation gives rise to a simple question: how can this be? We answer this question by taking a careful look at the field of hyperbolic graph representation learning as it stands today, and find that a number of results do not diligently present baselines, make faulty modelling assumptions when constructing algorithms, and use misleading metrics to quantify geometry of graph datasets. We take a closer look at each of these three problems, elucidate the issues, perform an analysis of methods, and introduce a parametric family of benchmark datasets to ascertain the applicability of (hyperbolic) graph neural networks.</p></details> | Published in TMLR |

Efficient training in this setting relies on min-edge-cut partitioning algorithms, which minimize cross-machine communication due to GNN neighborhood sampling. Yet, min-edge-cut partitioning over large graphs remains a challenge: State-of-the-art (SoTA) offline methods (e.g., METIS) are effective, but they require orders of magnitude more memory and runtime than GNN training itself, while computationally efficient algorithms (e.g., streaming greedy approaches) suffer from increased edge cuts. Thus, in this work we introduce Armada, a new end-to-end system for distributed GNN training whose key contribution is GREM, a novel min-edge-cut partitioning algorithm that can efficiently scale to large graphs. GREM builds on streaming greedy approaches with one key addition: prior vertex assignments are continuously refined during streaming, rather than frozen after an initial greedy selection. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results show that this refinement is critical to minimizing edge cuts and enables GREM to reach partition quality comparable to METIS but with 8-65x less memory and 8-46x faster. Given a partitioned graph, Armada leverages a new disaggregated architecture for distributed GNN training to further improve efficiency; we find that on common cloud machines, even with zero communication, GNN neighborhood sampling and feature loading bottleneck training. Disaggregation allows Armada to independently allocate resources for these operations and ensure that expensive GPUs remain saturated with computation. We evaluate Armada against SoTA systems for distributed GNN training and find that the disaggregated architecture leads to runtime improvements up to 4.5x and cost reductions up to 3.1x.</p></details> |  |

Recent embedding-based EA methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in EA yet faced interpretability challenges as they purely rely on the embedding distance and neglect the logic rules behind a pair of aligned entities. In this paper, we propose the Align-Subgraph Entity Alignment (ASGEA) framework to exploit logic rules from Align-Subgraphs. ASGEA uses anchor links as bridges to construct Align-Subgraphs and spreads along the paths across KGs, which distinguishes it from the embedding-based methods. Furthermore, we design an interpretable Path-based Graph Neural Network, ASGNN, to effectively identify and integrate the logic rules across KGs. We also introduce a node-level multi-modal attention mechanism coupled with multi-modal enriched anchors to augment the Align-Subgraph. Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of ASGEA over the existing embedding-based methods in both EA and Multi-Modal EA (MMEA) tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work; 16 pages, 9 Tables, 8 Figures; Code: https://github.com/lyyf2002/ASGEA</p></details> |

Notably, most real-world heterophilic graphs are composed of a mixture of nodes with different neighbor patterns, exhibiting local node-level homophilic and heterophilic structures. However, existing works are only devoted to designing better HGNN backbones or architectures for node classification tasks on heterophilic and homophilic graph benchmarks simultaneously, and their analyses of HGNN performance with respect to nodes are only based on the determined data distribution without exploring the effect caused by this structural difference between training and testing nodes. How to learn invariant node representations on heterophilic graphs to handle this structure difference or distribution shifts remains unexplored. In this paper, we first discuss the limitations of previous graph-based invariant learning methods from the perspective of data augmentation. Then, we propose \textbf{HEI}, a framework capable of generating invariant node representations through incorporating heterophily information to infer latent environments without augmentation, which are then used for invariant prediction, under heterophilic graph structure distribution shifts. We theoretically show that our proposed method can achieve guaranteed performance under heterophilic graph structure distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and backbones can also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with existing state-of-the-art baselines.

However, the influence of the input graph's topology on GNN behavior remains poorly understood. In this work, we explore whether GNNs are inherently limited by the structure of their input graphs, focusing on how local topological features interact with the message-passing scheme to produce global phenomena such as oversmoothing or expressive representations. We introduce the concept of $k$-hop similarity and investigate whether locally similar neighborhoods lead to consistent node representations. This interaction can result in either effective learning or inevitable oversmoothing, depending on the inherent properties of the graph. Our empirical experiments validate these insights, highlighting the practical implications of graph topology on GNN performance.</p></details> |  |

While we may observe these external transactions, they are governed by unseen production functions, which determine how firms internally transform the input products they receive into output products that they sell. In this setting, it can be extremely valuable to infer these production functions, to improve supply chain visibility and to forecast future transactions more accurately. However, existing graph neural networks (GNNs) cannot capture these hidden relationships between nodes' inputs and outputs. Here, we introduce a new class of models for this setting by combining temporal GNNs with a novel inventory module, which learns production functions via attention weights and a special loss function. We evaluate our models extensively on real supply chains data and data generated from our new open-source simulator, SupplySim. Our models successfully infer production functions, outperforming the strongest baseline by 6%-50% (across datasets), and forecast future transactions, outperforming the strongest baseline by 11%-62%</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the extended version of a paper accepted to AAAI 2025, AI for Social Impact Track (oral)</p></details> |

Existing LLM-based graph analysis approaches either integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) for specific machine learning tasks, limiting their transferability, or rely solely on LLMs' internal reasoning ability, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we take advantage of recent advances in LLM-based agents, which have shown capabilities of utilizing external knowledge or tools for problem solving. By simulating human problem-solving strategies such as analogy and collaboration, we propose a multi-agent system based on LLMs named GraphTeam, for graph analysis. GraphTeam consists of five LLM-based agents from three modules, and the agents with different specialities can collaborate with each other to address complex problems. Specifically, (1) input-output normalization module: the question agent extracts and refines four key arguments from the original question, facilitating the problem understanding, and the answer agent organizes the results to meet the output requirement; (2) external knowledge retrieval module: we first build a knowledge base consisting of relevant documentation and experience information, and then the search agent retrieves the most relevant entries for each question. (3) problem-solving module: given the retrieved information from search agent, the coding agent uses established algorithms via programming to generate solutions, and in case the coding agent does not work, the reasoning agent will directly compute the results without programming. Extensive experiments on six graph analysis benchmarks demonstrate that GraphTeam achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 25.85% improvement over the best baseline in terms of accuracy.

| **[Detecting Code Vulnerabilities with Heterogeneous GNN Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16835v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting vulnerabilities in source code is a critical task for software security assurance. Graph Neural Network (GNN) machine learning can be a promising approach by modeling source code as graphs. Early approaches treated code elements uniformly, limiting their capacity to model diverse relationships that contribute to various vulnerabilities. Recent research addresses this limitation by considering the heterogeneity of node types and using Gated Graph Neural Networks (GGNN) to aggregate node information through different edge types. However, these edges primarily function as conduits for passing node information and may not capture detailed characteristics of distinct edge types. This paper presents Inter-Procedural Abstract Graphs (IPAGs) as an efficient, language-agnostic representation of source code, complemented by heterogeneous GNN training for vulnerability prediction. IPAGs capture the structural and contextual properties of code elements and their relationships. We also propose a Heterogeneous Attention GNN (HAGNN) model that incorporates multiple subgraphs capturing different features of source code. These subgraphs are learned separately and combined using a global attention mechanism, followed by a fully connected neural network for final classification. The proposed approach has achieved up to 96.6% accuracy on a large C dataset of 108 vulnerability types and 97.8% on a large Java dataset of 114 vulnerability types, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Its applications to various real-world software projects have also demonstrated low false positive rates.</p></details> |  |

Due to privacy concerns and conflicts of interest that prevent clients from directly sharing graph data with one another, Vertical Graph Federated Learning (VGFL) frameworks have been developed. Recent studies have shown that VGFL is vulnerable to adversarial attacks that degrade performance. However, it is a common problem that client nodes are often unlabeled in the realm of VGFL. Consequently, the existing attacks, which rely on the availability of labeling information to obtain gradients, are inherently constrained in their applicability. This limitation precludes their deployment in practical, real-world environments. To address the above problems, we propose a novel graph adversarial attack against VGFL, referred to as VGFL-SA, to degrade the performance of VGFL by modifying the local clients structure without using labels. Specifically, VGFL-SA uses a contrastive learning method to complete the attack before the local clients are trained. VGFL-SA first accesses the graph structure and node feature information of the poisoned clients, and generates the contrastive views by node-degree-based edge augmentation and feature shuffling augmentation. Then, VGFL-SA uses the shared graph encoder to get the embedding of each view, and the gradients of the adjacency matrices are obtained by the contrastive function. Finally, perturbed edges are generated using gradient modification rules. We validated the performance of VGFL-SA by performing a node classification task on real-world datasets, and the results show that VGFL-SA achieves good attack effectiveness and transferability.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional methods face challenges when dealing with heterogeneous graphs that contain various types of nodes and edges due to the diverse sources and complex nature of the data. Existing Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have shown promising results but require prior knowledge of node and edge types and unified node feature formats, which limits their applicability. Recent advancements in graph representation learning using Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new solutions by integrating LLMs' data processing capabilities, enabling the alignment of various graph representations. Nevertheless, these methods often overlook heterogeneous graph data and require extensive preprocessing. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method that leverages the strengths of both LLM and GNN, allowing for the processing of graph data with any format and type of nodes and edges without the need for type information or special preprocessing. Our method employs LLM to automatically summarize and classify different data formats and types, aligns node features, and uses a specialized GNN for targeted learning, thus obtaining effective graph representations for downstream tasks.

However, the irregularity and sparsity of graph data challenge traditional computing methods, which are insufficient to meet the performance demands of GNNs. Recent research has explored parallel acceleration using CUDA Cores and Tensor Cores, but significant challenges persist: (1) kernel fusion leads to false high utilization, failing to treat CUDA and Tensor Cores as independent resources, and (2) heterogeneous cores have distinct computation preferences, causing inefficiencies. To address these issues, this paper proposes FTC-GNN, a novel acceleration framework that efficiently utilizes CUDA and Tensor Cores for GNN computation. FTC-GNN introduces (1) a collaborative design that enables the parallel utilization of CUDA and Tensor Cores and (2) a sparse-to-dense transformation strategy that assigns dense matrix operations to Tensor Cores while leveraging CUDA Cores for data management and sparse edge processing. This design optimizes GPU resource utilization and improves computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FTC-GNN using GCN and AGNN models across various datasets. For GCN, FTC-GNN achieves speedups of 4.90x, 7.10x, and 1.17x compared to DGL, PyG, and TC-GNN, respectively. For AGNN, it achieves speedups of 5.32x, 2.92x, and 1.02x, establishing its superiority in accelerating GNN computations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Subsampling Graphs with GNN Performance Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16703v1)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can we subsample graph data so that a graph neural network (GNN) trained on the subsample achieves performance comparable to training on the full dataset? This question is of fundamental interest, as smaller datasets reduce labeling costs, storage requirements, and computational resources needed for training. Selecting an effective subset is challenging: a poorly chosen subsample can severely degrade model performance, and empirically testing multiple subsets for quality obviates the benefits of subsampling. Therefore, it is critical that subsampling comes with guarantees on model performance. In this work, we introduce new subsampling methods for graph datasets that leverage the Tree Mover's Distance to reduce both the number of graphs and the size of individual graphs. To our knowledge, our approach is the first that is supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees: we prove that training a GNN on the subsampled data results in a bounded increase in loss compared to training on the full dataset. Unlike existing methods, our approach is both model-agnostic, requiring minimal assumptions about the GNN architecture, and label-agnostic, eliminating the need to label the full training set. This enables subsampling early in the model development pipeline (before data annotation, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning) reducing costs and resources needed for storage, labeling, and training. We validate our theoretical results with experiments showing that our approach outperforms existing subsampling methods across multiple datasets.</p></details> |  |

This work proposes a method that surpasses the performance of established machine learning models while simultaneously improving prediction interpretability for diabetic retinopathy staging from optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images. Our method is based on a novel biology-informed heterogeneous graph representation that models retinal vessel segments, intercapillary areas, and the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in a human-interpretable way. This graph representation allows us to frame diabetic retinopathy staging as a graph-level classification task, which we solve using an efficient graph neural network. We benchmark our method against well-established baselines, including classical biomarker-based classifiers, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and vision transformers. Our model outperforms all baselines on two datasets. Crucially, we use our biology-informed graph to provide explanations of unprecedented detail. Our approach surpasses existing methods in precisely localizing and identifying critical vessels or intercapillary areas. In addition, we give informative and human-interpretable attributions to critical characteristics. Our work contributes to the development of clinical decision-support tools in ophthalmology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Expressive Power of Spectral Graph Neural Networks with Eigenvalue Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15603v3)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, spectral graph neural networks, characterized by polynomial filters, have garnered increasing attention and have achieved remarkable performance in tasks such as node classification. These models typically assume that eigenvalues for the normalized Laplacian matrix are distinct from each other, thus expecting a polynomial filter to have a high fitting ability. However, this paper empirically observes that normalized Laplacian matrices frequently possess repeated eigenvalues. Moreover, we theoretically establish that the number of distinguishable eigenvalues plays a pivotal role in determining the expressive power of spectral graph neural networks. In light of this observation, we propose an eigenvalue correction strategy that can free polynomial filters from the constraints of repeated eigenvalue inputs. Concretely, the proposed eigenvalue correction strategy enhances the uniform distribution of eigenvalues, thus mitigating repeated eigenvalues, and improving the fitting capacity and expressive power of polynomial filters. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.

| **[Towards Precise Prediction Uncertainty in GNNs: Refining GNNs with Topology-grouping Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14223v2)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) have highlighted the critical need of calibrating model predictions, with neighborhood prediction similarity recognized as a pivotal component. Existing studies suggest that nodes with analogous neighborhood prediction similarity often exhibit similar calibration characteristics. Building on this insight, recent approaches incorporate neighborhood similarity into node-wise temperature scaling techniques. However, our analysis reveals that this assumption does not hold universally. Calibration errors can differ significantly even among nodes with comparable neighborhood similarity, depending on their confidence levels. This necessitates a re-evaluation of existing GNN calibration methods, as a single, unified approach may lead to sub-optimal calibration. In response, we introduce **Simi-Mailbox**, a novel approach that categorizes nodes by both neighborhood similarity and their own confidence, irrespective of proximity or connectivity. Our method allows fine-grained calibration by employing *group-specific* temperature scaling, with each temperature tailored to address the specific miscalibration level of affiliated nodes, rather than adhering to a uniform trend based on neighborhood similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our **Simi-Mailbox** across diverse datasets on different GNN architectures, achieving up to 13.79\% error reduction compared to uncalibrated GNN predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Within this broad category, Asynchronous Recurrent Graph Neural Networks (ARGNNs) stand out for their ability to capture complex dependencies in dynamic graphs, resembling living organisms' intricate and adaptive nature. However, their complexity often leads to large and computationally expensive models. Therefore, pruning unnecessary edges becomes crucial for enhancing efficiency without significantly compromising performance. This paper presents a dynamic pruning method based on graph spectral theory, leveraging the imaginary component of the eigenvalues of the network graph's Laplacian.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphCheck: Breaking Long-Term Text Barriers with Extracted Knowledge Graph-Powered Fact-Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16514v1)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are widely used, but they often generate subtle factual errors, especially in long-form text. These errors are fatal in some specialized domains such as medicine. Existing fact-checking with grounding documents methods face two main challenges: (1) they struggle to understand complex multihop relations in long documents, often overlooking subtle factual errors; (2) most specialized methods rely on pairwise comparisons, requiring multiple model calls, leading to high resource and computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{\textit{GraphCheck}}, a fact-checking framework that uses extracted knowledge graphs to enhance text representation. Graph Neural Networks further process these graphs as a soft prompt, enabling LLMs to incorporate structured knowledge more effectively. Enhanced with graph-based reasoning, GraphCheck captures multihop reasoning chains which are often overlooked by existing methods, enabling precise and efficient fact-checking in a single inference call. Experimental results on seven benchmarks spanning both general and medical domains demonstrate a 6.1\% overall improvement over baseline models. Notably, GraphCheck outperforms existing specialized fact-checkers and achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art LLMs, such as DeepSeek-V3 and OpenAI-o1, with significantly fewer parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAPN: Enhancing Heterogeneous Sparse Graph Representation by Mamba-based Asynchronous Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16454v1)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the state of the art for various graph-related tasks and are particularly prominent in heterogeneous graphs (HetGs). However, several issues plague this paradigm: first, the difficulty in fully utilizing long-range information, known as over-squashing; second, the tendency for excessive message-passing layers to produce indistinguishable representations, referred to as over-smoothing; and finally, the inadequacy of conventional MPNNs to train effectively on large sparse graphs. To address these challenges in deep neural networks for large-scale heterogeneous graphs, this paper introduces the Mamba-based Asynchronous Propagation Network (MAPN), which enhances the representation of heterogeneous sparse graphs. MAPN consists of two primary components: node sequence generation and semantic information aggregation. Node sequences are initially generated based on meta-paths through random walks, which serve as the foundation for a spatial state model that extracts essential information from nodes at various distances. It then asynchronously aggregates semantic information across multiple hops and layers, effectively preserving unique node characteristics and mitigating issues related to deep network degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MAPN in graph embeddings for various downstream tasks underscoring its substantial benefits for graph representation in large sparse heterogeneous graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Network Tomography with Path-Centric Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16430v1)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network tomography is a crucial problem in network monitoring, where the observable path performance metric values are used to infer the unobserved ones, making it essential for tasks such as route selection, fault diagnosis, and traffic control. However, most existing methods either assume complete knowledge of network topology and metric formulas-an unrealistic expectation in many real-world scenarios with limited observability-or rely entirely on black-box end-to-end models. To tackle this, in this paper, we argue that a good network tomography requires synergizing the knowledge from both data and appropriate inductive bias from (partial) prior knowledge. To see this, we propose Deep Network Tomography (DeepNT), a novel framework that leverages a path-centric graph neural network to predict path performance metrics without relying on predefined hand-crafted metrics, assumptions, or the real network topology. The path-centric graph neural network learns the path embedding by inferring and aggregating the embeddings of the sequence of nodes that compose this path. Training path-centric graph neural networks requires learning the neural netowrk parameters and network topology under discrete constraints induced by the observed path performance metrics, which motivates us to design a learning objective that imposes connectivity and sparsity constraints on topology and path performance triangle inequality on path performance. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of DeepNT in predicting performance metrics and inferring graph topology compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Large Language Models as Topological Structure Enhancers for Text-Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14324v3)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The latest advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP). Inspired by the success of LLMs in NLP tasks, some recent work has begun investigating the potential of applying LLMs in graph learning tasks. However, most of the existing work focuses on utilizing LLMs as powerful node feature augmenters, leaving employing LLMs to enhance graph topological structures an understudied problem. In this work, we explore how to leverage the information retrieval and text generation capabilities of LLMs to refine/enhance the topological structure of text-attributed graphs (TAGs) under the node classification setting. First, we propose using LLMs to help remove unreliable edges and add reliable ones in the TAG. Specifically, we first let the LLM output the semantic similarity between node attributes through delicate prompt designs, and then perform edge deletion and edge addition based on the similarity. Second, we propose using pseudo-labels generated by the LLM to improve graph topology, that is, we introduce the pseudo-label propagation as a regularization to guide the graph neural network (GNN) in learning proper edge weights. Finally, we incorporate the two aforementioned LLM-based methods for graph topological refinement into the process of GNN training, and perform extensive experiments on four real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM-based graph topology refinement (achieving a 0.15%--2.47% performance gain on public benchmarks).</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Towards Expressive Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06587v3)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting has remained a focal point due to its vital applications in sectors such as energy management and transportation planning. Spectral-temporal graph neural network is a promising abstraction underlying most time series forecasting models that are based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, more is needed to know about the underpinnings of this branch of methods. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework that unravels the expressive power of spectral-temporal GNNs. Our results show that linear spectral-temporal GNNs are universal under mild assumptions, and their expressive power is bounded by our extended first-order Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm on discrete-time dynamic graphs. To make our findings useful in practice on valid instantiations, we discuss related constraints in detail and outline a theoretical blueprint for designing spatial and temporal modules in spectral domains. Building on these insights and to demonstrate how powerful spectral-temporal GNNs are based on our framework, we propose a simple instantiation named Temporal Graph Gegenbauer Convolution (TGGC), which significantly outperforms most existing models with only linear components and shows better model efficiency. Our findings pave the way for devising a broader array of provably expressive GNN-based models for time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 14 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

The central aim of this study is to enhance feature extraction and classification performance by utilizing multiscale object-based image analysis (OBIA). Traditional pixel-based methods often suffer from low accuracy and speckle noise, while single-scale OBIA approaches may overlook crucial information of image objects at different levels of detail. MOB-GCN overcomes these challenges by extracting and integrating features from multiple segmentation scales, leveraging the Multiresolution Graph Network (MGN) architecture to capture both fine-grained and global spatial patterns. MOB-GCN addresses this issue by extracting and integrating features from multiple segmentation scales to improve classification results using the Multiresolution Graph Network (MGN) architecture that can model fine-grained and global spatial patterns. By constructing a dynamic multiscale graph hierarchy, MOB-GCN offers a more comprehensive understanding of the intricate details and global context of HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that MOB-GCN consistently outperforms single-scale graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in terms of classification accuracy, computational efficiency, and noise reduction, particularly when labeled data is limited. The implementation of MOB-GCN is publicly available at https://github.com/HySonLab/MultiscaleHSI</p></details> |  |
| **[HetFS: A Method for Fast Similarity Search with Ad-hoc Meta-paths on Heterogeneous Information Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16288v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous real-world information networks form Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs) with diverse objects and relations represented as nodes and edges in heterogeneous graphs. Similarity between nodes quantifies how closely two nodes resemble each other, mainly depending on the similarity of the nodes they are connected to, recursively. Users may be interested in only specific types of connections in the similarity definition, represented as meta-paths, i.e., a sequence of node and edge types. Existing Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN)-based similarity search methods may accommodate meta-paths, but require retraining for different meta-paths. Conversely, existing path-based similarity search methods may switch flexibly between meta-paths but often suffer from lower accuracy, as they rely solely on path information. This paper proposes HetFS, a Fast Similarity method for ad-hoc queries with user-given meta-paths on Heterogeneous information networks. HetFS provides similarity results based on path information that satisfies the meta-path restriction, as well as node content. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of HetFS in addressing ad-hoc queries, outperforming state-of-the-art HGNNs and path-based approaches, and showing strong performance in downstream applications, including link prediction, node classification, and clustering.</p></details> |  |
| **[FHGE: A Fast Heterogeneous Graph Embedding with Ad-hoc Meta-paths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16281v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as the state of the art for a variety of graph-related tasks and have been widely used in Heterogeneous Graphs (HetGs), where meta-paths help encode specific semantics between various node types. Despite the revolutionary representation capabilities of existing heterogeneous GNNs (HGNNs) due to their focus on improving the effectiveness of heterogeneity capturing, the huge training costs hinder their practical deployment in real-world scenarios that frequently require handling ad-hoc queries with user-defined meta-paths. To address this, we propose FHGE, a Fast Heterogeneous Graph Embedding designed for efficient, retraining-free generation of meta-path-guided graph embeddings. The key design of the proposed framework is two-fold: segmentation and reconstruction modules. It employs Meta-Path Units (MPUs) to segment the graph into local and global components, enabling swift integration of node embeddings from relevant MPUs during reconstruction and allowing quick adaptation to specific meta-paths. In addition, a dual attention mechanism is applied to enhance semantics capturing. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of FHGE in generating meta-path-guided graph embeddings and downstream tasks, such as link prediction and node classification, highlighting its significant advantages for real-time graph analysis in ad-hoc queries.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the linear-constrained validity (LVP) problem for verifying GNNs properties, and provide an efficient translation from LVP instances into a logical language. We show that LVP is in PSPACE, for any reasonable activation functions. We provide a proof system. We also prove PSPACE-hardness, indicating that while reasoning about quantized GNNs is feasible, it remains generally computationally challenging.</p></details> |  |

This limitation stems from two main factors: (1) the inadequacy of conventional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in representing sophisticated topological features, and (2) the focus of self-supervised learning solely on final graph representations. To address these issues, we introduce \emph{GenHopNet}, a GNN framework that integrates a $k$-hop message-passing scheme, enhancing its ability to capture local structural information without explicit substructure extraction. We theoretically demonstrate that \emph{GenHopNet} surpasses the expressiveness of the classical Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test for graph isomorphism. Furthermore, we propose a structural- and positional-aware GSSL framework that incorporates topological information throughout the learning process. This approach enables the learning of representations that are both sensitive to graph topology and invariant to specific structural and feature augmentations. Comprehensive experiments on graph classification datasets, including those designed to test structural sensitivity, show that our method consistently outperforms the existing approaches and maintains computational efficiency. Our work significantly advances GSSL's capability in distinguishing graphs with similar local structures but different global topologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by The World Wide Web Conference (WWW) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Converting Transformers into DGNNs Form](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00585v2)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning have established Transformer architectures as the predominant modeling paradigm. Central to the success of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism, which scores the similarity between query and key matrices to modulate a value matrix. This operation bears striking similarities to digraph convolution, prompting an investigation into whether digraph convolution could serve as an alternative to self-attention. In this study, we formalize this concept by introducing a synthetic unitary digraph convolution based on the digraph Fourier transform. The resulting model, which we term Converter, effectively converts a Transformer into a Directed Graph Neural Network (DGNN) form. We have tested Converter on Long-Range Arena benchmark, long document classification, and DNA sequence-based taxonomy classification. Our experimental results demonstrate that Converter achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency and architectural simplicity, which establishes it as a lightweight yet powerful Transformer variant.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 3 figures, and 8 tables; pseudocode improved</p></details> |

Nevertheless, it is challenging to establish an accurate data representation for complex urban forms that are readily explicable in human terms. This study proposed the concept of core urban morphology representation and developed an explainable deep learning framework for explicably symbolizing complex urban forms into the novel representation, which we call CoMo. By interpretating the well-trained deep learning model with a stable weighted F1-score of 89.14%, CoMo presents a promising approach for revealing links between urban function and urban form in terms of core urban morphology representation. Using Boston as a study area, we analyzed the core urban forms at the individual-building, block, and neighborhood level that are important to corresponding urban functions. The residential core forms follow a gradual morphological pattern along the urban spine, which is consistent with a center-urban-suburban transition. Furthermore, we prove that urban morphology directly affects land use efficiency, which has a significantly strong correlation with the location (R2=0.721, p<0.001). Overall, CoMo can explicably symbolize urban forms, provide evidence for the classic urban location theory, and offer mechanistic insights for digital twins.</p></details> |  |
| **[Co-evolution-based Metal-binding Residue Prediction with Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16189v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In computational structural biology, predicting metal-binding sites and their corresponding metal types is challenging due to the complexity of protein structures and interactions. Conventional sequence- and structure-based prediction approaches cannot capture the complex evolutionary relationships driving these interactions to facilitate understanding, while recent co-evolution-based approaches do not fully consider the entire structure of the co-evolved residue network. In this paper, we introduce MBGNN (Metal-Binding Graph Neural Network) that utilizes the entire co-evolved residue network and effectively captures the complex dependencies within protein structures via graph neural networks to enhance the prediction of co-evolved metal-binding residues and their associated metal types. Experimental results on a public dataset show that MBGNN outperforms existing co-evolution-based metal-binding prediction methods, and it is also competitive against recent sequence-based methods, showing the potential of integrating co-evolutionary insights with advanced machine learning to deepen our understanding of protein-metal interactions.

| **[Explainable AI for Fraud Detection: An Attention-Based Ensemble of CNNs, GNNs, and A Confidence-Driven Gating Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09069v2)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of e-commerce and the widespread use of credit cards in online purchases and financial transactions have significantly heightened the importance of promptly and accurately detecting credit card fraud (CCF). Not only do fraudulent activities in financial transactions lead to substantial monetary losses for banks and financial institutions, but they also undermine user trust in digital services. This study presents a new stacking-based approach for CCF detection by adding two extra layers to the usual classification process: an attention layer and a confidence-based combination layer. In the attention layer, we combine soft outputs from a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) using the dependent ordered weighted averaging (DOWA) operator, and from a graph neural network (GNN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network using the induced ordered weighted averaging (IOWA) operator. These weighted outputs capture different predictive signals, increasing the model's accuracy. Next, in the confidence-based layer, we select whichever aggregate (DOWA or IOWA) shows lower uncertainty to feed into a meta-learner. To make the model more explainable, we use shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to identify the top ten most important features for distinguishing between fraud and normal transactions. These features are then used in our attention-based model. Experiments on three datasets show that our method achieves high accuracy and robust generalization, making it effective for CCF detection.</p></details> |  |
