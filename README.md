| **[A Dataset of Performance Measurements and Alerts from Mozilla (Data Artifact)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16332v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performance regressions in software systems can lead to significant financial losses and degraded user satisfaction, making their early detection and mitigation critical. Despite the importance of practices that capture performance regressions early, there is a lack of publicly available datasets that comprehensively capture real-world performance measurements, expert-validated alerts, and associated metadata such as bugs and testing conditions. To address this gap, we introduce a unique dataset to support various research studies in performance engineering, anomaly detection, and machine learning. This dataset was collected from Mozilla Firefox's performance testing infrastructure and comprises 5,655 performance time series, 17,989 performance alerts, and detailed annotations of resulting bugs collected from May 2023 to May 2024. By publishing this dataset, we provide researchers with an invaluable resource for studying performance trends, developing novel change point detection methods, and advancing performance regression analysis across diverse platforms and testing environments. The dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14642238</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional approaches aiming at direct prediction of system dynamics, CLINE identifies static geometric features of the phase space that encode the (non)linear relationships between state variables. It overcomes challenges such as multiple time scales and strong nonlinearities while producing interpretable results convertible into symbolic differential equations. We validate CLINE on various oscillatory systems, showcasing its effectiveness.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Assessment of Spatio-Temporal Predictors in the Presence of Missing and Heterogeneous Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01701v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning approaches achieve outstanding predictive performance in modeling modern data, despite the increasing complexity and scale. However, evaluating the quality of predictive models becomes more challenging, as traditional statistical assumptions often no longer hold. In particular, spatio-temporal data exhibit dependencies across both time and space, often involving nonlinear dynamics, non-stationarities, and missing observations. As a result, advanced predictors such as spatio-temporal graph neural networks require novel evaluation methodologies. This paper introduces a residual correlation analysis framework designed to assess the optimality of spatio-temporal predictive neural models, particularly in scenarios with incomplete and heterogeneous data. By leveraging the principle that residual correlation indicates information not captured by the model, this framework serves as a powerful tool to identify and localize regions in space and time where model performance can be improved. A key advantage of the proposed approach is its ability to operate under minimal assumptions, enabling robust evaluation of deep learning models applied to multivariate time series, even in the presence of missing and heterogeneous data. The methodology employs tailored spatio-temporal graphs to encode sparse spatial and temporal dependencies within the data and utilizes asymptotically distribution-free summary statistics to pinpoint time intervals and spatial regions where the model underperforms. The effectiveness of the proposed residual analysis is demonstrated through validation on both synthetic and real-world scenarios involving state-of-the-art predictive models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-supervised New Activity Detection in Sensor-based Smart Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10288v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of ubiquitous computing technology, human activity analysis based on time series data from a diverse range of sensors enables the delivery of more intelligent services. Despite the importance of exploring new activities in real-world scenarios, existing human activity recognition studies generally rely on predefined known activities and often overlook detecting new patterns (novelties) that have not been previously observed during training. Novelty detection in human activities becomes even more challenging due to (1) diversity of patterns within the same known activity, (2) shared patterns between known and new activities, and (3) differences in sensor properties of each activity dataset. We introduce CLAN, a two-tower model that leverages Contrastive Learning with diverse data Augmentation for New activity detection in sensor-based environments. CLAN simultaneously and explicitly utilizes multiple types of strongly shifted data as negative samples in contrastive learning, effectively learning invariant representations that adapt to various pattern variations within the same activity. To enhance the ability to distinguish between known and new activities that share common features, CLAN incorporates both time and frequency domains, enabling the learning of multi-faceted discriminative representations. Additionally, we design an automatic selection mechanism of data augmentation methods tailored to each dataset's properties, generating appropriate positive and negative pairs for contrastive learning. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets show that CLAN achieves a 9.24% improvement in AUROC compared to the best-performing baseline model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deterministic Reservoir Computing for Chaotic Time Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15615v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir Computing was shown in recent years to be useful as efficient to learn networks in the field of time series tasks. Their randomized initialization, a computational benefit, results in drawbacks in theoretical analysis of large random graphs, because of which deterministic variations are an still open field of research. Building upon Next-Gen Reservoir Computing and the Temporal Convolution Derived Reservoir Computing, we propose a deterministic alternative to the higher-dimensional mapping therein, TCRC-LM and TCRC-CM, utilizing the parametrized but deterministic Logistic mapping and Chebyshev maps. To further enhance the predictive capabilities in the task of time series forecasting, we propose the novel utilization of the Lobachevsky function as non-linear activation function. As a result, we observe a new, fully deterministic network being able to outperform TCRCs and classical Reservoir Computing in the form of the prominent Echo State Networks by up to $99.99\%$ for the non-chaotic time series and $87.13\%$ for the chaotic ones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection in Industry 5.0](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15946v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industry5.0 environments present a critical need for effective anomaly detection methods that can indicate equipment malfunctions, process inefficiencies, or potential safety hazards. The ever-increasing sensorization of manufacturing lines makes processes more observable, but also poses the challenge of continuously analyzing vast amounts of multivariate time series data. These challenges include data quality since data may contain noise, be unlabeled or even mislabeled. A promising approach consists of combining an embedding model with other Machine Learning algorithms to enhance the overall performance in detecting anomalies. Moreover, representing time series as vectors brings many advantages like higher flexibility and improved ability to capture complex temporal dependencies. We tested our solution in a real industrial use case, using data collected from a Bonfiglioli plant. The results demonstrate that, unlike traditional reconstruction-based autoencoders, which often struggle in the presence of sporadic noise, our embedding-based framework maintains high performance across various noise conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Gaussian central limit theorem for a stationary time series with infinite varia](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15894v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a borderline case: the central limit theorem for a strictly stationary time series with infinite variance but a Gaussian limit. In the iid case a well-known sufficient condition for this central limit theorem is regular variation of the marginal distribution with tail index $\alpha=2$. In the dependent case we assume the stronger condition of sequential regular variation of the time series with tail index $\alpha=2$. We assume that a sample of size $n$ from this time series can be split into $k_n$ blocks of size $r_n\to\infty$ such that $r_n/n\to 0$ as $n\to\infty$ and that the block sums are asymptotically independent. Then we apply classical central limit theory for row-wise iid triangular arrays. The necessary and sufficient conditions for such independent block sums will be verified by using large deviation results for the time series. We derive the central limit theorem for $m$-dependent sequences, linear processes, stochastic volatility processes and solutions to affine stochastic recurrence equations whose marginal distributions have infinite variance and are regularly varying with tail index $\alpha=2$.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[Advancing Time Series Wildfire Spread Prediction: Modeling Improvements and the WSTS+ Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12003v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has demonstrated the potential of deep neural networks (DNNs) to accurately predict wildfire spread on a given day based upon high-dimensional explanatory data from a single preceding day, or from a time series of T preceding days. Here, we introduce a variety of modeling improvements that achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy for both single-day and multi-day input scenarios, as evaluated on a large public benchmark for next-day wildfire spread, termed the WildfireSpreadTS (WSTS) benchmark. Consistent with prior work, we found that models using time-series input obtained the best overall accuracy. Furthermore, we create a new benchmark, WSTS+, by incorporating four additional years of historical wildfire data into the WSTS benchmark. Our benchmark doubles the number of unique years of historical data, expands its geographic scope, and, to our knowledge, represents the largest public benchmark for time-series-based wildfire spread prediction.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[CLIMB: Data Foundations for Large Scale Multimodal Clinical Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07667v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in clinical AI have enabled remarkable progress across many clinical domains. However, existing benchmarks and models are primarily limited to a small set of modalities and tasks, which hinders the development of large-scale multimodal methods that can make holistic assessments of patient health and well-being. To bridge this gap, we introduce Clinical Large-Scale Integrative Multimodal Benchmark (CLIMB), a comprehensive clinical benchmark unifying diverse clinical data across imaging, language, temporal, and graph modalities. CLIMB comprises 4.51 million patient samples totaling 19.01 terabytes distributed across 2D imaging, 3D video, time series, graphs, and multimodal data. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that multitask pretraining significantly improves performance on understudied domains, achieving up to 29% improvement in ultrasound and 23% in ECG analysis over single-task learning. Pretraining on CLIMB also effectively improves models' generalization capability to new tasks, and strong unimodal encoder performance translates well to multimodal performance when paired with task-appropriate fusion strategies. Our findings provide a foundation for new architecture designs and pretraining strategies to advance clinical AI research. Code is released at https://github.com/DDVD233/climb.</p></details> |  |
| **[LOCAL: Learning with Orientation Matrix to Infer Causal Structure from Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19464v4)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering the underlying Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) from time series observational data is highly challenging due to the dynamic nature and complex nonlinear interactions between variables. Existing methods typically search for the optimal DAG by optimizing an objective function but face scalability challenges, as their computational demands grow exponentially with the dimensional expansion of variables. To this end, we propose LOCAL, a highly efficient, easy-to-implement, and constraint-free method for recovering dynamic causal structures. LOCAL is the first attempt to formulate a quasi-maximum likelihood-based score function for learning the dynamic DAG equivalent to the ground truth. Building on this, we introduce two adaptive modules that enhance the algebraic characterization of acyclicity: Asymptotic Causal Mask Learning (ACML) and Dynamic Graph Parameter Learning (DGPL). ACML constructs causal masks using learnable priority vectors and the Gumbel-Sigmoid function, ensuring DAG formation while optimizing computational efficiency. DGPL transforms causal learning into decomposed matrix products, capturing dynamic causal structure in high-dimensional data and improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that LOCAL significantly outperforms existing methods and highlight LOCAL's potential as a robust and efficient method for dynamic causal discovery.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |
| **[KDSelector: A Knowledge-Enhanced and Data-Efficient Model Selector Learning Framework for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12478v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model selection has been raised as an essential problem in the area of time series anomaly detection (TSAD), because there is no single best TSAD model for the highly heterogeneous time series in real-world applications. However, despite the success of existing model selection solutions that train a classification model (especially neural network, NN) using historical data as a selector to predict the correct TSAD model for each series, the NN-based selector learning methods used by existing solutions do not make full use of the knowledge in the historical data and require iterating over all training samples, which limits the accuracy and training speed of the selector. To address these limitations, we propose KDSelector, a novel knowledge-enhanced and data-efficient framework for learning the NN-based TSAD model selector, of which three key components are specifically designed to integrate available knowledge into the selector and dynamically prune less important and redundant samples during the learning. We develop a TSAD model selection system with KDSelector as the internal, to demonstrate how users improve the accuracy and training speed of their selectors by using KDSelector as a plug-and-play module.

| **[Line Space Clustering (LSC): Feature-Based Clustering using K-medians and Dynamic Time Warping for Versatility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15777v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustering high-dimensional data is a critical challenge in machine learning due to the curse of dimensionality and the presence of noise. Traditional clustering algorithms often fail to capture the intrinsic structures in such data. This paper explores a combination of clustering methods, which we called Line Space Clustering (LSC), a representation that transforms data points into lines in a newly defined feature space, enabling clustering based on the similarity of feature value patterns, essentially treating features as sequences. LSC employs a combined distance metric that uses Euclidean and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances, weighted by a parameter {\alpha}, allowing flexibility in emphasizing shape or magnitude similarities. We delve deeply into the mechanics of DTW and the Savitzky Golay filter, explaining their roles in the algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of LSC on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing that randomly experimenting with time-series optimized methods sometimes might surprisingly work on a complex dataset, particularly in noisy environments.

| **[Time Series Classification of Supraglacial Lakes Evolution over Greenland Ice Sheet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05638v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) has emerged as a significant contributor to global sea level rise, primarily due to increased meltwater runoff. Supraglacial lakes, which form on the ice sheet surface during the summer months, can impact ice sheet dynamics and mass loss; thus, better understanding these lakes' seasonal evolution and dynamics is an important task. This study presents a computationally efficient time series classification approach that uses Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) of the Reconstructed Phase Spaces (RPSs) to identify supraglacial lakes based on their seasonal evolution: 1) those that refreeze at the end of the melt season, 2) those that drain during the melt season, and 3) those that become buried, remaining liquid insulated a few meters beneath the surface. Our approach uses time series data from the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites, which utilize microwave and visible radiation, respectively. Evaluated on a GrIS-wide dataset, the RPS-GMM model, trained on a single representative sample per class, achieves 85.46% accuracy with Sentinel-1 data alone and 89.70% with combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. This performance significantly surpasses existing machine learning and deep learning models which require a large training data. The results demonstrate the robustness of the RPS-GMM model in capturing the complex temporal dynamics of supraglacial lakes with minimal training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2024 International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA).

| **[Macroeconomic Forecasting with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00890v3)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a comparative analysis evaluating the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) against traditional macro time series forecasting approaches. In recent times, LLMs have surged in popularity for forecasting due to their ability to capture intricate patterns in data and quickly adapt across very different domains. However, their effectiveness in forecasting macroeconomic time series data compared to conventional methods remains an area of interest. To address this, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of LLMs against traditional macro forecasting methods, using as common ground the FRED-MD database. Our findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs in forecasting macroeconomic time series, shedding light on their applicability in real-world scenarios</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Encoding Strategies for Energy Time Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15456v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In contemporary power systems, energy consumption prediction plays a crucial role in maintaining grid stability and resource allocation enabling power companies to minimize energy waste and avoid overloading the grid. While there are several research works on energy optimization, they often fail to address the complexities of real-time fluctuations and the cyclic pattern of energy consumption. This work proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy of predictive models by employing sinusoidal encoding on periodic features of time-series data. To demonstrate the increase in performance, several statistical and ensemble machine learning models were trained on an energy demand dataset, using the proposed sinusoidal encoding. The performance of these models was then benchmarked against identical models trained on traditional encoding methods. The results demonstrated a 12.6% improvement of Root Mean Squared Error (from 0.5497 to 0.4802) and a 7.8% increase in the R^2 score (from 0.7530 to 0.8118), indicating that the proposed encoding better captures the cyclic nature of temporal patterns than traditional methods. The proposed methodology significantly improves prediction accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications in smart grid systems.</p></details> |  |

This study explores the potential of hybrid quantum-classical approaches to assist in financial trend prediction by leveraging quantum resources for improved feature representation and learning. A custom Quantum Neural Network (QNN) regressor is introduced, designed with a novel ansatz tailored for financial applications. Two hybrid optimization strategies are proposed: (1) a sequential approach where classical recurrent models (RNN/LSTM) extract temporal dependencies before quantum processing, and (2) a joint learning framework that optimizes classical and quantum parameters simultaneously. Systematic evaluation using TimeSeriesSplit, k-fold cross-validation, and predictive error analysis highlights the ability of these hybrid models to integrate quantum computing into financial forecasting workflows. The findings demonstrate how quantum-assisted learning can contribute to financial modeling, offering insights into the practical role of quantum resources in time-series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages and 11 figures</p></details> |
| **[ImputeGAP: A Comprehensive Library for Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15250v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the prevalence of sensor failures, imputation--the process of estimating missing values--has emerged as the cornerstone of time series data preparation. While numerous imputation algorithms have been developed to address these data gaps, existing libraries provide limited support. Furthermore, they often lack the ability to simulate realistic patterns of time series missing data and fail to account for the impact of imputation on subsequent downstream analysis. This paper introduces ImputeGAP, a comprehensive library for time series imputation that supports a diverse range of imputation methods and modular missing data simulation catering to datasets with varying characteristics. The library includes extensive customization options, such as automated hyperparameter tuning, benchmarking, explainability, downstream evaluation, and compatibility with popular time series frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Foundation Model for Patient Behavior Monitoring and Suicide Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15221v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet their adoption in healthcare remains limited. While significant advances have been made in medical imaging, genetic biomarkers, and time series from electronic health records, the potential of FMs for patient behavior monitoring through wearable devices remains underexplored. These datasets are inherently heterogeneous, multisource, and often exhibit high rates of missing data, posing unique challenges. This paper introduces a novel FM based on a modified vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), specifically designed to process real-world data from wearable devices. We demonstrate that our pretrained FM, trained on a broad cohort of psychiatric patients, performs downstream tasks via its latent representation without fine-tuning on a held-out cohort of suicidal patients. To illustrate this, we develop a probabilistic change-point detection algorithm for suicide detection and demonstrate the FM's effectiveness in predicting emotional states. Our results show that the discrete latent structure of the VQ-VAE outperforms a state-of-the-art Informer architecture in unsupervised suicide detection, while matching its performance in supervised emotion prediction when the latent dimensionality is increased, though at the cost of reduced unsupervised accuracy. This trade-off highlights the need for future FMs to integrate hybrid discrete-continuous structures for balanced performance across tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (31 with appendices), 6 figures (13 with appendices); submitted to UAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Sparseformer: a Transferable Transformer with Multi-granularity Token Sparsification for Medical Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15578v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical time series (MedTS) classification is crucial for improved diagnosis in healthcare, and yet it is challenging due to the varying granularity of patterns, intricate inter-channel correlation, information redundancy, and label scarcity. While existing transformer-based models have shown promise in time series analysis, they mainly focus on forecasting and fail to fully exploit the distinctive characteristics of MedTS data. In this paper, we introduce Sparseformer, a transformer specifically designed for MedTS classification. We propose a sparse token-based dual-attention mechanism that enables global modeling and token compression, allowing dynamic focus on the most informative tokens while distilling redundant features. This mechanism is then applied to the multi-granularity, cross-channel encoding of medical signals, capturing intra- and inter-granularity correlations and inter-channel connections. The sparsification design allows our model to handle heterogeneous inputs of varying lengths and channels directly. Further, we introduce an adaptive label encoder to address label space misalignment across datasets, equipping our model with cross-dataset transferability to alleviate the medical label scarcity issue. Our model outperforms 12 baselines across seven medical datasets under supervised learning. In the few-shot learning experiments, our model also achieves superior average results. In addition, the in-domain and cross-domain experiments among three diagnostic scenarios demonstrate our model's zero-shot learning capability. Collectively, these findings underscore the robustness and transferability of our model in various medical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 fig...</summary><p>3 figures, 16 pages, 5 tables</p></details> |

This paper examines the banana tree data structure, specifically designed to efficiently maintain persistent homology -- a multi-scale topological descriptor -- for dynamically changing time series data. We implement this data structure and conduct an experimental study to assess its properties and runtime for update operations. Our findings indicate that banana trees are highly effective with unbiased random data, outperforming state-of-the-art static algorithms in these scenarios. Additionally, our results show that real-world time series share structural properties with unbiased random walks, suggesting potential practical utility for our implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at SoCG 2025</p></details> |

In our approach, a diffusion-based time series forecasting model is used to probabilistically estimate the evolution of the system's stochastic components. These forecasts are then incorporated into MPC algorithms to estimate future trajectories and optimize action selection under the uncertainty of the future. We evaluate the framework on the task of energy arbitrage, where a Battery Energy Storage System participates in the day-ahead electricity market of the New York state. Experimental results indicate that our model-based approach with a diffusion-based forecaster significantly outperforms both implementations with classical forecasting methods and model-free reinforcement learning baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables.

| **[Persistent Homology-induced Graph Ensembles for Time Series Regressions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14240v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) in time-series applications is often limited by their dependence on fixed, hand-crafted input graph structures. Motivated by insights from the Topological Data Analysis (TDA) paradigm, of which real-world data exhibits multi-scale patterns, we construct several graphs using Persistent Homology Filtration -- a mathematical framework describing the multiscale structural properties of data points. Then, we use the constructed graphs as an input to create an ensemble of Graph Neural Networks. The ensemble aggregates the signals from the individual learners via an attention-based routing mechanism, thus systematically encoding the inherent multiscale structures of data. Four different real-world experiments on seismic activity prediction and traffic forecasting (PEMS-BAY, METR-LA) demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms single-graph baselines while providing interpretable insights.</p></details> |  |
| **[Iterative Trace Minimization for the Reconciliation of Very Short Hierarchical Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18550v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series often appear in an additive hierarchical structure. In such cases, time series on higher levels are the sums of their subordinate time series. This hierarchical structure places a natural constraint on forecasts. However, univariate forecasting techniques are incapable of ensuring this forecast coherence. An obvious solution is to forecast only bottom time series and obtain higher level forecasts through aggregation. This approach is also known as the bottom-up approach. In their seminal paper, \citep{Wickramasuriya2019} propose an optimal reconciliation approach named MinT. It tries to minimize the trace of the underlying covariance matrix of all forecast errors. The MinT algorithm has demonstrated superior performance to the bottom-up and other approaches and enjoys great popularity. This paper provides a simulation study examining the performance of MinT for very short time series and larger hierarchical structures. This scenario makes the covariance estimation required by MinT difficult. A novel iterative approach is introduced which significantly reduces the number of estimated parameters. This approach is capable of improving forecast accuracy further. The application of MinTit is also demonstrated with a case study at the hand of a semiconductor dataset based on data provided by the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), a premier provider of semiconductor market data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bernstein-type Inequalities and Nonparametric Estimation under Near-Epoch Dependence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11433v4)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The major contributions of this paper lie in two aspects. Firstly, we focus on deriving Bernstein-type inequalities for both geometric and algebraic irregularly-spaced NED random fields, which contain time series as special case. Furthermore, by introducing the idea of "effective dimension" to the index set of random field, our results reflect that the sharpness of inequalities are only associated with this "effective dimension". Up to the best of our knowledge, our paper may be the first one reflecting this phenomenon. Hence, the first contribution of this paper can be more or less regarded as an update of the pioneering work from \citeA{xu2018sieve}. Additionally, as a corollary of our first contribution, a Bernstein-type inequality for geometric irregularly-spaced $\alpha$-mixing random fields is also obtained. The second aspect of our contributions is that, based on the inequalities mentioned above, we show the $L_{\infty}$ convergence rate of the many interesting kernel-based nonparametric estimators. To do this, two deviation inequalities for the supreme of empirical process are derived under NED and $\alpha$-mixing conditions respectively. Then, for irregularly-spaced NED random fields, we prove the attainability of optimal rate for local linear estimator of nonparametric regression, which refreshes another pioneering work on this topic, \citeA{jenish2012nonparametric}. Subsequently, we analyze the uniform convergence rate of uni-modal regression under the same NED conditions as well. Furthermore, by following the guide of \citeA{rigollet2009optimal}, we also prove that the kernel-based plug-in density level set estimator could be optimal up to a logarithm factor. Meanwhile, when the data is collected from $\alpha$-mixing random fields, we also derive the uniform convergence rate of a simple local polynomial density estimator \cite{cattaneo2020simple}.</p></details> |  |

| **[Information-theoretic limits and approximate message-passing for high-dimensional time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13625v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional time series appear in many scientific setups, demanding a nuanced approach to model and analyze the underlying dependence structure. Theoretical advancements so far often rely on stringent assumptions regarding the sparsity of the underlying signal. In non-sparse regimes, analyses have primarily focused on linear regression models with the design matrix having independent rows. In this paper, we expand the scope by investigating a high-dimensional time series model wherein the number of features grows proportionally to the number of sampling points, without assuming sparsity in the signal. Specifically, we consider the stochastic regression model and derive a single-letter formula for the normalized mutual information between observations and the signal, as well as for minimum mean-square errors. We also empirically study the vector approximate message passing VAMP algorithm and show that, despite the lack of theoretical guarantees, its performance for inference in our time series model is robust and often statistically optimal.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Time Series Models with Knowledge Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14869v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data is one of the most ubiquitous data modalities existing in a diverse critical domains such as healthcare, seismology, manufacturing and energy. Recent years, there are increasing interest of the data mining community to develop time series deep learning models to pursue better performance. The models performance often evaluate by certain evaluation metrics such as RMSE, Accuracy, and F1-score. Yet time series data are often hard to interpret and are collected with unknown environmental factors, sensor configuration, latent physic mechanisms, and non-stationary evolving behavior. As a result, a model that is better on standard metric-based evaluation may not always perform better in real-world tasks. In this blue sky paper, we aim to explore the challenge that exists in the metric-based evaluation framework for time series data mining and propose a potential blue-sky idea -- developing a knowledge-discovery-based evaluation framework, which aims to effectively utilize domain-expertise knowledge to evaluate a model. We demonstrate that an evidence-seeking explanation can potentially have stronger persuasive power than metric-based evaluation and obtain better generalization ability for time series data mining tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in SIAM SDM 2025 - Blue Sky Track (to appear)</p></details> |
| **[How Can Time Series Analysis Benefit From Multiple Modalities? A Survey and Outlook](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11835v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis (TSA) is a longstanding research topic in the data mining community and has wide real-world significance. Compared to "richer" modalities such as language and vision, which have recently experienced explosive development and are densely connected, the time-series modality remains relatively underexplored and isolated. We notice that many recent TSA works have formed a new research field, i.e., Multiple Modalities for TSA (MM4TSA). In general, these MM4TSA works follow a common motivation: how TSA can benefit from multiple modalities. This survey is the first to offer a comprehensive review and a detailed outlook for this emerging field. Specifically, we systematically discuss three benefits: (1) reusing foundation models of other modalities for efficient TSA, (2) multimodal extension for enhanced TSA, and (3) cross-modality interaction for advanced TSA. We further group the works by the introduced modality type, including text, images, audio, tables, and others, within each perspective. Finally, we identify the gaps with future opportunities, including the reused modalities selections, heterogeneous modality combinations, and unseen tasks generalizations, corresponding to the three benefits. We release an up-to-date GitHub repository that includes key papers and resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github Repo: https://github.com/AdityaLab/MM4TSA</p></details> |

This paper is the first to establish uniform convergence rates for the Nadaraya-Watson estimators of their coefficients. We derive these rates over unbounded support under the assumptions of a vanishing observation interval and a long time horizon. Our findings serve as essential tools for specification testing and semiparametric inference in various diffusion models and time series, facilitating applications in finance, geology, and physics through nonparametric estimation methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[On a Dissimilarity Metric for Analyzing Body Synergistic Coordination in Non-Periodic Motion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14821v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes a novel metric to quantitatively evaluate body synergistic coordination, explicitly addressing dynamic interactions between pairs of body segments in baseball pitching motions. Conventional methods typically compare motion trajectories using individual joint coordinates or velocities independently, employing techniques like Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) that inherently apply temporal alignment even when such correction may distort meaningful rhythm-based differences. In contrast, our approach models the coordination dynamics as Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems, leveraging convolution operations between pairs of time series data to capture the gain and phase-lag inherent in genuine coordination dynamics. Empirical validation demonstrates the robustness of the proposed metric to variations in camera angles and scaling, providing superior discriminative capability compared to DTW and deep learning-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 11 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[fabisearch: A Package for Change Point Detection in and Visualization of the Network Structure of Multivariate High-Dimensional Time Series in R](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02986v4)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Change point detection is a commonly used technique in time series analysis, capturing the dynamic nature in which many real-world processes function. With the ever increasing troves of multivariate high-dimensional time series data, especially in neuroimaging and finance, there is a clear need for scalable and data-driven change point detection methods. Currently, change point detection methods for multivariate high-dimensional data are scarce, with even less available in high-level, easily accessible software packages. To this end, we introduce the R package fabisearch, available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), which implements the factorized binary search (FaBiSearch) methodology. FaBiSearch is a novel statistical method for detecting change points in the network structure of multivariate high-dimensional time series which employs non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), an unsupervised dimension reduction and clustering technique. Given the high computational cost of NMF, we implement the method in C++ code and use parallelization to reduce computation time. Further, we also utilize a new binary search algorithm to efficiently identify multiple change points and provide a new method for network estimation for data between change points. We show the functionality of the package and the practicality of the method by applying it to a neuroimaging and a finance data set. Lastly, we provide an interactive, 3-dimensional, brain-specific network visualization capability in a flexible, stand-alone function. This function can be conveniently used with any node coordinate atlas, and nodes can be color coded according to community membership (if applicable). The output is an elegantly displayed network laid over a cortical surface, which can be rotated in the 3-dimensional space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Set Features for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14773v4)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes to use set features for detecting anomalies in samples that consist of unusual combinations of normal elements. Many leading methods discover anomalies by detecting an unusual part of a sample. For example, state-of-the-art segmentation-based approaches, first classify each element of the sample (e.g., image patch) as normal or anomalous and then classify the entire sample as anomalous if it contains anomalous elements. However, such approaches do not extend well to scenarios where the anomalies are expressed by an unusual combination of normal elements. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by proposing set features that model each sample by the distribution of its elements. We compute the anomaly score of each sample using a simple density estimation method, using fixed features. Our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in image-level logical anomaly detection and sequence-level time series anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.12245</p></details> |

This complexity, stemming from interactions among EVs, PV systems, customer behavior, and weather conditions, calls for a scalable framework to capture a full range of possible scenarios and analyze grid responses to factor in compound uncertainty. Although this process is challenging for many utilities today, the need to model numerous grid parameters as random variables and evaluate the impact on the system from many different perspectives will become increasingly essential to facilitate more strategic and well-informed planning investments. We present a scalable, stochastic-aware distribution system planning application that addresses these uncertainties by capturing spatial and temporal variability through a Markov model and conducting Monte Carlo simulations leveraging modular cloud-based architecture. The results demonstrate that 15,000 power flow scenarios generated from the Markov model are completed on the modified IEEE 123-bus test feeder, with each simulation representing an 8,760-hour time series run, all in under an hour. The grid impact extracted from this huge volume of simulated data provides insights into the spatial and temporal effects of adopted technology, highlighting that planning solely for average conditions is inadequate, while worst-case scenario planning may lead to prohibitive expenses.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Zero-shot forecasting of chaotic systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15771v3)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting is a challenging problem that traditionally requires specialized models custom-trained for the specific task at hand. Recently, inspired by the success of large language models, foundation models pre-trained on vast amounts of time-series data from diverse domains have emerged as a promising candidate for general-purpose time-series forecasting. The defining characteristic of these foundation models is their ability to perform zero-shot learning, that is, forecasting a new system from limited context data without explicit re-training or fine-tuning. Here, we evaluate whether the zero-shot learning paradigm extends to the challenging task of forecasting chaotic systems. Across 135 distinct chaotic dynamical systems and $10^8$ timepoints, we find that foundation models produce competitive forecasts compared to custom-trained models (including NBEATS, TiDE, etc.), particularly when training data is limited. Interestingly, even after point forecasts fail, large foundation models are able to preserve the geometric and statistical properties of the chaotic attractors. We attribute this success to foundation models' ability to perform in-context learning and identify context parroting as a simple mechanism used by these models to capture the long-term behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. Our results highlight the potential of foundation models as a tool for probing nonlinear and complex systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>13th ...</summary><p>13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

When analyzing time series, we often seek to understand the underlying events occurring in the measured environment. For example, one might ask: What caused a sharp drop in the stock price? Events are often described with natural language, so we conduct the first study of whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer natural language events from time series. We curate a new benchmark featuring win probabilities collected from 4,200 basketball and American football games, featuring 1.7M timesteps with real value data and corresponding natural language events. Building on the recent wave of using LLMs on time series, we evaluate 16 LLMs and find that they demonstrate promising abilities to infer events from time series data. The open-weights DeepSeek-R1 32B model outperforms proprietary models like GPT-4o. Despite this impressive initial performance, we also find clear avenues to improve recent models, as we identify failures when altering the provided context, event sequence lengths, and evaluation strategy.

These non-auto-regressive approaches involving different generative methods, including GAN, Diffusion, and Flow Matching for time series, have empirically demonstrated high-quality generation capability and accuracy. However, we still lack an appropriate understanding of how it processes approximation and generalization. This paper presents the first theoretical framework from the perspective of flow-based generative models to relieve the knowledge of limitations. In particular, we provide our insights with strict guarantees from three perspectives: $\textbf{Approximation}$, $\textbf{Generalization}$ and $\textbf{Efficiency}$. In detail, our analysis achieves the contributions as follows: $\bullet$ By assuming a general data model, the fitting of the flow-based generative models is confirmed to converge to arbitrary error under the universal approximation of Diffusion Transformer (DiT). $\bullet$ Introducing a polynomial-based regularization for flow matching, the generalization error thus be bounded since the generalization of polynomial approximation. $\bullet$ The sampling for generation is considered as an optimization process, we demonstrate its fast convergence with updating standard first-order gradient descent of some objective.</p></details> | 33 pages |

This is an essential task in a wide range of domains including weather forecasting, stock market analysis and disease outbreak prediction. Over the decades LTSF algorithms have transitioned from statistical models to deep learning models like transformer models. Despite the complex architecture of transformer based LTSF models `Are Transformers Effective for Time Series Forecasting? (Zeng et al., 2023)' showed that simple linear models can outperform the state-of-the-art transformer based LTSF models. Recently, quantum machine learning (QML) is evolving as a domain to enhance the capabilities of classical machine learning models. In this paper we initiate the application of QML to LTSF problems by proposing QuLTSF, a simple hybrid QML model for multivariate LTSF. Through extensive experiments on a widely used weather dataset we show the advantages of QuLTSF over the state-of-the-art classical linear models, in terms of reduced mean squared error and mean absolute error.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ICAART 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Neural Scaling Laws for Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12360v3)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling laws offer valuable insights into the design of time series foundation models (TSFMs). However, previous research has largely focused on the scaling laws of TSFMs for in-distribution (ID) data, leaving their out-of-distribution (OOD) scaling behavior and the influence of model architectures less explored. In this work, we examine two common TSFM architectures, encoder-only and decoder-only Transformers, and investigate their scaling behavior on both ID and OOD data. These models are trained and evaluated across varying parameter counts, compute budgets, and dataset sizes. Our experiments reveal that the log-likelihood loss of TSFMs exhibits similar scaling behavior in both OOD and ID settings. We further compare the scaling properties across different architectures, incorporating two state-of-the-art TSFMs as case studies, showing that model architecture plays a significant role in scaling. The encoder-only Transformers demonstrate better scalability than the decoder-only Transformers, while the architectural enhancements in the two advanced TSFMs primarily improve ID performance but reduce OOD scalability. While scaling up TSFMs is expected to drive performance breakthroughs, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of TSFM scaling laws has hindered the development of a robust framework to guide model scaling. We fill this gap in this work by synthesizing our findings and providing practical guidelines for designing and scaling larger TSFMs with enhanced model capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

This study introduces a novel deep learning framework that advances time series forecasting for infectious diseases, with its application to COVID 19 data as a critical case study. Our hybrid approach integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models to capture spatial and temporal dynamics of disease transmission across diverse regions. The CNN extracts spatial features from raw epidemiological data, while the LSTM models temporal patterns, yielding precise and adaptable predictions. To maximize performance, we employ a hybrid optimization strategy combining the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO) to fine tune hyperparameters, such as learning rates, batch sizes, and training epochs enhancing model efficiency and accuracy. Applied to COVID 19 case data from 24 countries across six continents, our method outperforms established benchmarks, including ARIMA and standalone LSTM models, with statistically significant gains in predictive accuracy (e.g., reduced RMSE). This framework demonstrates its potential as a versatile method for forecasting epidemic trends, offering insights for resource planning and decision making in both historical contexts, like the COVID 19 pandemic, and future outbreaks.</p></details> |  |

I call it artificial delete-$d$ jackknife to stress that this approach substitutes the classic removal step with a fictitious deletion, wherein observed datapoints are replaced with artificial missing values. This procedure keeps the data order intact and allows plain compatibility with time series. This manuscript justifies the use of this approach asymptotically and shows its finite-sample advantages through simulation studies. Besides, this article describes its real-world advantages by regulating forecasting models for foreign exchange rates.</p></details> |  |

Continuous time models enable us to properly provide scale-based time series models for irregularly-spaced observations for the first time, while also permitting a spectral representation of the process over a continuous range of scales. We derive results for both the theoretical setting, where we assume access to the entire process sample path, and a more practical one, which develops methods for estimating the quantities of interest from sampled time series. The latter estimates are accurately computable in reasonable time by solving the relevant linear integral equation using the iterative soft-thresholding algorithm due to Daubechies, Defrise and De~Mol. Appropriate smoothing techniques are also developed and applied in this new setting. Comparisons to previous methods are conducted on the heart rate time series of a sleeping infant. Additionally, we exemplify our new methods by computing spectral and autocovariance estimates on irregularly-spaced heart rate data obtained from a recent sleep-state study.</p></details> | 47 pages, 17 figures |

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an invaluable tool for disturbance mapping, providing consistent time-series images of the ground regardless of weather or illumination conditions. Despite SAR's potential for disturbance mapping, processing SAR data to an analysis-ready format requires expertise and significant compute resources, particularly for large-scale global analysis. In October 2023, NASA's Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) project released the near-global Radiometric Terrain Corrected SAR backscatter from Sentinel-1 (RTC-S1) dataset, providing publicly available, analysis-ready SAR imagery. In this work, we utilize this new dataset to systematically analyze land surface disturbances. As labeling SAR data is often prohibitively time-consuming, we train a self-supervised vision transformer - which requires no labels to train - on OPERA RTC-S1 data to estimate a per-pixel distribution from the set of baseline imagery and assess disturbances when there is significant deviation from the modeled distribution. To test our model's capability and generality, we evaluate three different natural disasters - which represent high-intensity, abrupt disturbances - from three different regions of the world. Across events, our approach yields high quality delineations: F1 scores exceeding 0.6 and Areas Under the Precision-Recall Curve exceeding 0.65, consistently outperforming existing SAR disturbance methods. Our findings suggest that a self-supervised vision transformer is well-suited for global disturbance mapping and can be a valuable tool for operational, near-global disturbance monitoring, particularly when labeled data does not exist.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 18 figures, 5 tables.

However, effective analysis of multi-modal time series is hindered by data heterogeneity, modality gap, misalignment, and inherent noise. Recent advancements in multi-modal time series methods have exploited the multi-modal context via cross-modal interactions based on deep learning methods, significantly enhancing various downstream tasks. In this tutorial and survey, we present a systematic and up-to-date overview of multi-modal time series datasets and methods. We first state the existing challenges of multi-modal time series analysis and our motivations, with a brief introduction of preliminaries. Then, we summarize the general pipeline and categorize existing methods through a unified cross-modal interaction framework encompassing fusion, alignment, and transference at different levels (\textit{i.e.}, input, intermediate, output), where key concepts and ideas are highlighted. We also discuss the real-world applications of multi-modal analysis for both standard and spatial time series, tailored to general and specific domains. Finally, we discuss future research directions to help practitioners explore and exploit multi-modal time series.

We address key challenges in scaling models with neural time-series data, namely, sparse and variable electrode distribution across subjects and datasets. The Population Transformer (PopT) stacks on top of pretrained temporal embeddings and enhances downstream decoding by enabling learned aggregation of multiple spatially-sparse data channels. The pretrained PopT lowers the amount of data required for downstream decoding experiments, while increasing accuracy, even on held-out subjects and tasks. Compared to end-to-end methods, this approach is computationally lightweight, while achieving similar or better decoding performance. We further show how our framework is generalizable to multiple time-series embeddings and neural data modalities. Beyond decoding, we interpret the pretrained and fine-tuned PopT models to show how they can be used to extract neuroscience insights from large amounts of data. We release our code as well as a pretrained PopT to enable off-the-shelf improvements in multi-channel intracranial data decoding and interpretability.

While various approaches for TSC have been explored, important properties of time series, such as shift equivariance and inversion invariance, are largely underexplored by existing works. To fill this gap, we propose a novel multi-view approach to capture patterns with properties like shift equivariance. Our method integrates diverse features, including spectral, temporal, local, and global features, to obtain rich, complementary contexts for TSC. We use continuous wavelet transform to capture time-frequency features that remain consistent even when the input is shifted in time. These features are fused with temporal convolutional or multilayer perceptron features to provide complex local and global contextual information. We utilize the Mamba state space model for efficient and scalable sequence modeling and capturing long-range dependencies in time series. Moreover, we introduce a new scanning scheme for Mamba, called tango scanning, to effectively model sequence relationships and leverage inversion invariance, thereby enhancing our model's generalization and robustness. Experiments on two sets of benchmark datasets (10+20 datasets) demonstrate our approach's effectiveness, achieving average accuracy improvements of 4.01-6.45\% and 7.93\% respectively, over leading TSC models such as TimesNet and TSLANet.</p></details> |  |

It shifts the focus from data fidelity to goal-oriented or task-oriented semantic transmission. While deep learning-based methods are commonly used for semantic encoding and decoding, they struggle with the sequential nature of time series data and high computation cost, particularly in resource-constrained IoT environments. Data compression plays a crucial role in reducing transmission and storage costs, yet traditional data compression methods fall short of the demands of goal-oriented communication systems. In this paper, we propose a novel method for direct analytics on time series data compressed by the SHRINK compression algorithm. Through experimentation using outlier detection as a case study, we show that our method outperforms baselines running on uncompressed data in multiple cases, with merely 1% difference in the worst case. Additionally, it achieves four times lower runtime on average and accesses approximately 10% of the data volume, which enables edge analytics with limited storage and computation power. These results demonstrate that our approach offers reliable, high-speed outlier detection analytics for diverse IoT applications while extracting semantics from time-series data, achieving high compression, and reducing data transmission.</p></details> |  |

Despite their strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs remain underutilized for motion sensor data due to the lack of semantic context in time-series, computational constraints, and challenges in processing numerical inputs. SensorLLM addresses these limitations through a Sensor-Language Alignment stage, where we introduce special tokens for each sensor channel and automatically generate textual trend descriptions. This alignment enables LLMs to capture numerical variations, channel-specific features, and data of varying duration--without requiring human annotations. In the subsequent Task-Aware Tuning stage, we refine the model for HAR classification, achieving performance that matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate that SensorLLM evolves into an effective sensor learner, reasoner, and classifier through Sensor-Language Alignment, generalizing across diverse HAR datasets. We believe this work establishes a foundation for future research on time-series and text alignment, paving the way for foundation models in sensor data analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Augmented Invertible Koopman Autoencoder for long-term time series forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12930v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Following the introduction of Dynamic Mode Decomposition and its numerous extensions, many neural autoencoder-based implementations of the Koopman operator have recently been proposed. This class of methods appears to be of interest for modeling dynamical systems, either through direct long-term prediction of the evolution of the state or as a powerful embedding for downstream methods. In particular, a recent line of work has developed invertible Koopman autoencoders (IKAEs), which provide an exact reconstruction of the input state thanks to their analytically invertible encoder, based on coupling layer normalizing flow models. We identify that the conservation of the dimension imposed by the normalizing flows is a limitation for the IKAE models, and thus we propose to augment the latent state with a second, non-invertible encoder network. This results in our new model: the Augmented Invertible Koopman AutoEncoder (AIKAE). We demonstrate the relevance of the AIKAE through a series of long-term time series forecasting experiments, on satellite image time series as well as on a benchmark involving predictions based on a large lookback window of observations.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce the general concept of $\mathcal{C}_{p,\mathcal{F}}$-mixing to cover such cases, where assumptions on the dependence structure become stronger with increasing $p\in [1, \infty].$ We derive a series of sharp exponential-type (or Bernstein-type) inequalities under this dependence concept for $p=1$ and $p=\infty$. More specifically, $\mathcal{C}_{\infty,\mathcal{F}}$-mixing is equal to the widely discussed $\mathcal{C}$-mixing \citep{maume2006exponential}, and we prove a refinement of an Berntsein-type inequality in \cite{hang2017bernstein} for $\mathcal{C}$-mixing processes under more general assumptions. As there exist many stochastic processes and dynamic systems, which are not $\mathcal{C}$ (or $\mathcal{C}_{\infty,\mathcal{F}}$)-mixing, we derive Bernstein-type inequalities for $\mathcal{C}_{1,\mathcal{F}}$-mixing processes as well and we use this result to investigate the convergence rates of plug-in-type estimators of the local conditional mode set for vector-valued output, in particular in situations where the density is less smooth.</p></details> |  |

Remote sensing based forest health monitoring, oftentimes, relies on supervised machine learning algorithms that require labeled training data. Monitoring temporal patterns through time series analysis offers a potential alternative for earlier detection of disturbance but requires substantial storage resources. This study investigates the potential of a Deep Learning algorithm based on a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Autoencoder for the detection of anomalies in forest health (e.g. bark beetle outbreaks), utilizing Sentinel-2 time series data. This approach is an alternative to supervised machine learning methods, avoiding the necessity for labeled training data. Furthermore, it is more memory-efficient than other time series analysis approaches, as a robust model can be created using only a 26-week-long time series as input. In this study, we monitored pure stands of spruce in Thuringia, Germany, over a 7-year period from 2018 to the end of 2024. Our best model achieved a detection accuracy of 87% on test data and was able to detect 61% of all anomalies at a very early stage (more than a month before visible signs of forest degradation). Compared to another widely used time series break detection algorithm - BFAST (Breaks For Additive Season and Trend), our approach consistently detected higher percentage of anomalies at an earlier stage. These findings suggest that LSTM-based Autoencoders could provide a promising, resource-efficient approach to forest health monitoring, enabling more timely responses to emerging threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 18 figures, submitted to IEEE: Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing</p></details> |

However, the high-dimensional spatial-temporal dynamics of turbulent flames typically pose considerable challenges to mode recognition. Based on the bidirectional temporal and nonlinear dimensionality reduction models, this study introduces a two-layer bidirectional long short-term memory variational autoencoder, Bi-LSTM-VAE model, to effectively recognize dynamical modes in annular combustion systems. Specifically, leveraging 16 pressure signals from a swirl-stabilized annular combustor, the model maps complex dynamics into a low-dimensional latent space while preserving temporal dependency and nonlinear behavior features through the recurrent neural network structure. The results show that the novel Bi-LSTM-VAE method enables a clear representation of combustion states in two-dimensional state space. Analysis of latent variable distributions reveals distinct patterns corresponding to a wide range of equivalence ratios and premixed fuel and air mass flow rates, offering novel insights into mode classification and transitions, highlighting this model's potential for deciphering complex thermoacoustic phenomena.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

Traditional methods for RUL prediction often struggle with issues such as data sparsity, varying battery chemistries, and the inability to capture complex degradation patterns over time. In this study, we propose a survival analysis-based framework combined with deep learning models to predict the RUL of lithium-ion batteries. Specifically, we utilize five advanced models: the Cox-type models (Cox, CoxPH, and CoxTime) and two machine-learning-based models (DeepHit and MTLR). These models address the challenges of accurate RUL estimation by transforming raw time-series battery data into survival data, including key degradation indicators such as voltage, current, and internal resistance. Advanced feature extraction techniques enhance the model's robustness in diverse real-world scenarios, including varying charging conditions and battery chemistries. Our models are tested using 10-fold cross-validation, ensuring generalizability and minimizing overfitting. Experimental results show that our survival-based framework significantly improves RUL prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods, providing a reliable tool for battery management and maintenance optimization. This study contributes to the advancement of predictive maintenance in battery technology, offering valuable insights for both researchers and industry practitioners aiming to enhance the operational lifespan of lithium-ion batteries.</p></details> |  |

The proposed framework consists of learnable prior distributions for low-dimensional graph representations and of a decoder that bridges the observed graphs and latent representations. The prior distributions of the latent spaces are learned from the observed data as empirical Bayes to assist change point detection. Specifically, the model parameters are estimated via maximum approximate likelihood, with a Group Fused Lasso regularization imposed on the prior parameters. The augmented Lagrangian is solved via Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, and Langevin Dynamics are recruited for posterior inference. Simulation studies show good performance of the latent space model in supporting change point detection and real data experiments yield change points that align with significant events.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses the challenging task of forecasting the volatility of financial assets with limited historical data, such as new issues or spin-offs, by proposing a multi-source transfer learning approach. Specifically, we exploit complementary source data of assets with a substantial historical data record by selecting source time series instances that are most similar to the limited target data of the new issue/spin-off. Based on these instances and the target data, we estimate linear and non-linear realized volatility models and compare their forecasting performance to forecasts of models trained exclusively on the target data, and models trained on the entire source and target data. The results show that our transfer learning approach outperforms the alternative models and that the integration of complementary data is also beneficial immediately after the initial trading day of the new issue/spin-off.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the International Journal of Forecasting</p></details> |

Industrial data exhibit characteristics such as multi-source heterogeneity, nonlinearity, strong coupling, and temporal interactions, while also being affected by noise interference. These complexities make it challenging for traditional anomaly detection methods to extract key features, impacting detection accuracy and stability. Traditional machine learning approaches often struggle with such complex data due to limitations in processing capacity and generalisation ability, making them inadequate for practical applications. While deep learning feature extraction modules have demonstrated remarkable performance in image and text processing, they remain ineffective when applied to multi-source heterogeneous industrial data lacking explicit correlations. Moreover, existing multi-source heterogeneous data processing techniques still rely on dimensionality reduction and feature selection, which can lead to information loss and difficulty in capturing high-order interactions. To address these challenges, this study applies the EAPCR and Time-EAPCR models proposed in previous research and introduces a new model, Time-EAPCR-T, where Transformer replaces the LSTM module in the time-series processing component of Time-EAPCR. This modification effectively addresses multi-source data heterogeneity, facilitates efficient multi-source feature fusion, and enhances the temporal feature extraction capabilities of multi-source industrial data.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches across four industrial datasets, highlighting its broad application potential.</p></details> |  |

Besides traditional methods that operate in the time domain, many recent models transform time series data into the frequency domain to better capture complex patterns. However, these methods often use filtering techniques to remove certain frequency signals as noise, which may unintentionally discard important information and reduce prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose the Frequency Decomposition Mixture-of-Experts (FreqMoE) model, which dynamically decomposes time series data into frequency bands, each processed by a specialized expert. A gating mechanism adjusts the importance of each output of expert based on frequency characteristics, and the aggregated results are fed into a prediction module that iteratively refines the forecast using residual connections. Our experiments demonstrate that FreqMoE outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving the best performance on 51 out of 70 metrics across all tested datasets, while significantly reducing the number of required parameters to under 50k, providing notable efficiency advantages.

Such noise can cause label quality to improve, worsen, or periodically change over time. We first propose and formalize temporal label noise, an unstudied problem for sequential classification of time series. In this setting, multiple labels are recorded over time while being corrupted by a time-dependent noise function. We first demonstrate the importance of modeling the temporal nature of the label noise function and how existing methods will consistently underperform. We then propose methods to train noise-tolerant classifiers by estimating the temporal label noise function directly from data.

Empowered by this learning capability, it has become a powerful tool for solving complex problems and is the core driver of many groundbreaking technologies and innovations. Building a deep learning model is challenging due to the algorithm's complexity and the dynamic nature of real-world problems. Several studies have reviewed deep learning concepts and applications.

The performance of state-of-the-art capacity prediction methods is significantly hindered by the limited availability of training data, primarily attributed to the expensive experimentation and data sharing restrictions. To tackle this issue, this paper presents a recurrent conditional generative adversarial network (RCGAN) scheme to enrich the limited battery data by adding high-fidelity synthetic ones to improve the capacity prediction. The proposed RCGAN scheme consists of a generator network to generate synthetic samples that closely resemble the true data and a discriminator network to differentiate real and synthetic samples. Long shortterm memory (LSTM)-based generator and discriminator are leveraged to learn the temporal and spatial distributions in the multivariate time-series battery data. Moreover, the generator is conditioned on the capacity value to account for changes in battery dynamics due to the degradation over usage cycles. The effectiveness of the RCGAN is evaluated across six batteries from two benchmark datasets (NASA and MIT). The raw data is then augmented with synthetic samples from the RCGAN to train LSTM and gate recurrent unit (GRU) models for capacity prediction. Simulation results show that the models trained with augmented datasets significantly outperform those trained with the original datasets in capacity prediction.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

Conventional models primarily employ long-only mechanisms, excluding highly correlated assets to diversify risk. However, incorporating short-selling enables low-risk arbitrage through hedging correlated assets. This paper constructs a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) portfolio management framework with short-selling mechanisms conforming to actual trading rules, exploring strategies for excess returns in China's A-share market. Key innovations include: (1) Development of a comprehensive short-selling mechanism in continuous trading that accounts for dynamic evolution of transactions across time periods; (2) Design of a long-short optimization framework integrating deep neural networks for processing multi-dimensional financial time series with mean Sharpe ratio reward functions. Empirical results show the DRL model with short-selling demonstrates significant optimization capabilities, achieving consistent positive returns during backtesting periods. Compared to traditional approaches, this model delivers superior risk-adjusted returns while reducing maximum drawdown. From an allocation perspective, the DRL model establishes a robust investment style, enhancing defensive capabilities through strategic avoidance of underperforming assets and balanced capital allocation. This research contributes to portfolio theory while providing novel methodologies for quantitative investment practice.</p></details> |  |

The advantages of FT, such as high efficiency and a global view, have been rapidly explored and exploited in various time series tasks and applications, demonstrating the promising potential of FT as a new deep learning paradigm for time series analysis. Despite the growing attention and the proliferation of research in this emerging field, there is currently a lack of a systematic review and in-depth analysis of deep learning-based time series models with FT. It is also unclear why FT can enhance time series analysis and what its limitations are in the field. To address these gaps, we present a comprehensive review that systematically investigates and summarizes the recent research advancements in deep learning-based time series analysis with FT. Specifically, we explore the primary approaches used in current models that incorporate FT, the types of neural networks that leverage FT, and the representative FT-equipped models in deep time series analysis. We propose a novel taxonomy to categorize the existing methods in this field, providing a structured overview of the diverse approaches employed in incorporating FT into deep learning models for time series analysis. Finally, we highlight the advantages and limitations of FT for time series modeling and identify potential future research directions that can further contribute to the community of time series analysis.</p></details> |  |

For example, in retail, covariates may indicate promotions or peak dates such as holiday seasons that heavily influence demand forecasts. Recent advances in pretraining large language model architectures for time series forecasting have led to highly accurate forecasters. However, the majority of these models do not readily use covariates as they are often specific to a certain task or domain. This paper introduces a new method to incorporate covariates into pretrained time series forecasting models. Our proposed approach incorporates covariate information into pretrained forecasting models through modular blocks that inject past and future covariate information, without necessarily modifying the pretrained model in consideration. In order to evaluate our approach, we introduce a benchmark composed of 32 different synthetic datasets with varying dynamics to evaluate the effectivity of forecasting models with covariates. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real datasets show that our approach effectively incorporates covariate information into pretrained models, outperforming existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 28th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS), 2025</p></details> |

Recent state-of-the-art works ignore the inter-relations between variates, using their model on each variate independently. This raises several research questions related to proper modeling of multivariate data. In this work, we propose to view multivariate forecasting as a multi-task learning problem, facilitating the analysis of forecasting by considering the angle between task gradients and their balance. To do so, we analyze linear models to characterize the behavior of tasks. Our analysis suggests that tasks can be defined by grouping similar variates together, which we achieve via a simple clustering that depends on correlation-based similarities. Moreover, to balance tasks, we scale gradients with respect to their prediction error. Then, each task is solved with a linear model within our MTLinear framework. We evaluate our approach on challenging benchmarks in comparison to strong baselines, and we show it obtains on-par or better results on multivariate forecasting problems.

Our study presents a systematic investigation of optimization techniques, focusing on structured pruning and quantization methods for transformer architectures. Through extensive experimentation on three distinct datasets (RefrigerationDevices, ElectricDevices, and PLAID), we quantitatively evaluate model performance and energy efficiency across different transformer configurations. Our experimental results demonstrate that static quantization reduces energy consumption by 29.14% while maintaining classification performance, and L1 pruning achieves a 63% improvement in inference speed with minimal accuracy degradation. Our findings provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of optimization strategies for transformer-based time series classification, establishing a foundation for efficient model deployment in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

Such data occurs widely, ranging from the scientific and medical domains to the industrial and environmental domains. When the properties in time series exhibit spatial variations, we often call the data spatio-temporal. As part of the continued digitalization of processes throughout society, increasingly large volumes of time series and spatio-temporal data are available. In this tutorial, we focus on data-driven decision making with such data, e.g., enabling greener and more efficient transportation based on traffic time series forecasting. The tutorial adopts the holistic paradigm of "data-governance-analytics-decision." We first introduce the data foundation of time series and spatio-temporal data, which is often heterogeneous. Next, we discuss data governance methods that aim to improve data quality. We then cover data analytics, focusing on five desired characteristics: automation, robustness, generality, explainability, and resource efficiency. We finally cover data-driven decision making strategies and briefly discuss promising research directions.

In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have greatly enhanced the performance of TSC models in these critical domains. However, DNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers can covertly implant triggers into models to induce malicious outcomes. Existing backdoor attacks targeting DNN-based TSC models remain elementary. In particular, early methods borrow trigger designs from computer vision, which are ineffective for time series data. More recent approaches utilize generative models for trigger generation, but at the cost of significant computational complexity. In this work, we analyze the limitations of existing attacks and introduce an enhanced method, FreqBack. Drawing inspiration from the fact that DNN models inherently capture frequency domain features in time series data, we identify that improper perturbations in the frequency domain are the root cause of ineffective attacks. To address this, we propose to generate triggers both effectively and efficiently, guided by frequency analysis. FreqBack exhibits substantial performance across five models and eight datasets, achieving an impressive attack success rate of over 90%, while maintaining less than a 3% drop in model accuracy on clean data.</p></details> | WWW 2025 (Oral) |
| **[Spatiotemporal clustering of GHGs emissions in Europe: exploring the role of spatial component](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11909v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we propose a novel application of spatiotemporal clustering in the environmental sciences, with a particular focus on regionalised time series of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions from a range of economic sectors. Utilising a hierarchical spatiotemporal clustering methodology, we analyse yearly time series of emissions by gases and sectors from 1990 to 2022 for European regions at the NUTS-2 level. While the clustering algorithm inherently incorporates spatial information based on geographical distance, the extent to which space contributes to the definition of groups still requires further exploration. To address this gap in the literature, we propose a novel indicator, namely the Joint Inertia, which quantifies the contribution of spatial distances when integrated with other features. Through a simulation experiment, we explore the relationship between the Joint Inertia and the relevance of geography in exploiting the groups structure under several configurations of spatial and features patterns, providing insights into the behaviour and potential of the proposed indicator. The empirical findings demonstrate the relevance of the spatial component in identifying emission patterns and dynamics, and the results reveal significant heterogeneity across clusters in trends and dynamics by gases and sectors. This reflects the heterogeneous economic and industrial characteristics of European regions. The study highlights the importance of the spatial and temporal dimensions in understanding GHGs emissions, offering baseline insights for future spatiotemporal modelling and supporting more targeted and regionally informed environmental policies.</p></details> |  |

Understanding the stability of a synchronized phenomenon is crucial for ensuring functionality in various complex systems. The stability of the synchronization phenomenon is extensively studied using the Master Stability Function (MSF). This powerful and elegant tool plays a pivotal role in determining the stability of synchronization states, providing deep insights into synchronization in coupled systems. Although MSF analysis has been used for 25 years to study the stability of synchronization states, a systematic investigation of MSF across various networked systems remains missing from the literature. In this article, we present a simplified and unified MSF analysis for diverse undirected and directed networked systems. We begin with the analytical MSF framework for pairwise-coupled identical systems with diffusive and natural coupling schemes and extend our analysis to directed networks and multilayer networks, considering both intra-layer and inter-layer interactions. Furthermore, we revisit the MSF framework to incorporate higher-order interactions alongside pairwise interactions. To enhance understanding, we also provide a numerical analysis of synchronization in coupled R\"ossler systems under pairwise diffusive coupling and propose algorithms for determining the MSF, identifying stability regimes, and classifying MSF functions. Overall, the primary goal of this review is to present a systematic study of MSF in coupled dynamical networks in a clear and structured manner, making this powerful tool more accessible. Furthermore, we highlight cases where the study of synchronization states using MSF remains underexplored. Additionally, we discuss recent research focusing on MSF analysis using time series data and machine learning approaches.</p></details> | 49 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we offer a fresh perspective on the classical problem of imputing missing time series data, whose underlying dynamics are assumed to be determined by ODEs. Specifically, we revisit ideas from amortized inference and neural operators, and propose a novel supervised learning framework for zero-shot time series imputation, through parametric functions satisfying some (hidden) ODEs. Our proposal consists of two components. First, a broad probability distribution over the space of ODE solutions, observation times and noise mechanisms, with which we generate a large, synthetic dataset of (hidden) ODE solutions, along with their noisy and sparse observations. Second, a neural recognition model that is trained offline, to map the generated time series onto the spaces of initial conditions and time derivatives of the (hidden) ODE solutions, which we then integrate to impute the missing data. We empirically demonstrate that one and the same (pretrained) recognition model can perform zero-shot imputation across 63 distinct time series with missing values, each sampled from widely different dynamical systems. Likewise, we demonstrate that it can perform zero-shot imputation of missing high-dimensional data in 10 vastly different settings, spanning human motion, air quality, traffic and electricity studies, as well as Navier-Stokes simulations -- without requiring any fine-tuning. What is more, our proposal often outperforms state-of-the-art methods, which are trained on the target datasets. Our pretrained model, repository and tutorials are available online.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, conventional Mamba-based models encounter significant challenges in accurately predicting stock time series, as they fail to adequately capture both the overarching market dynamics and the intricate interdependencies among individual stocks. To overcome these constraints, we introduce the Hierarchical Information-Guided Spatio-Temporal Mamba (HIGSTM) framework. HIGSTM introduces Index-Guided Frequency Filtering Decomposition to extract commonality and specificity from time series. The model architecture features a meticulously designed hierarchical framework that systematically captures both temporal dynamic patterns and global static relationships within the stock market. Furthermore, we propose an Information-Guided Mamba that integrates macro informations into the sequence selection process, thereby facilitating more market-conscious decision-making. Comprehensive experimental evaluations conducted on the CSI500, CSI800 and CSI1000 datasets demonstrate that HIGSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Finally, we predict supply and demand curves, once represented in a latent space, with a variety of machine learning methods (RF, LSTM, TSMixer). As our results on the MIBEL dataset show, a high dimensional structure of the market curves can be best handled by the nonlinear reduction technique UMAP. Regardless of the ML technique used for prediction, we achieved the lowest values for all considered precision metrics with a UMAP latent space representation in only two or three dimensions, even when compared to PCA and kPCA with five or six dimensions. Further, we demonstrate that the most promising machine learning technique to handle the complex structure of the electricity market curves is a novel TSMixer architecture. Finally, we fill the gap in the field of electricity market curves prediction literature: in addition to standard analysis on the supply side, we applied the ML framework and predicted demand curves too. We discussed the differences in the achieved results for these two types of curves.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Applied Soft Computing</p></details> |
| **[Federated Koopman-Reservoir Learning for Large-Scale Multivariate Time-Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11255v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of edge devices has dramatically increased the generation of multivariate time-series (MVTS) data, essential for applications from healthcare to smart cities. Such data streams, however, are vulnerable to anomalies that signal crucial problems like system failures or security incidents. Traditional MVTS anomaly detection methods, encompassing statistical and centralized machine learning approaches, struggle with the heterogeneity, variability, and privacy concerns of large-scale, distributed environments. In response, we introduce FedKO, a novel unsupervised Federated Learning framework that leverages the linear predictive capabilities of Koopman operator theory along with the dynamic adaptability of Reservoir Computing. This enables effective spatiotemporal processing and privacy preservation for MVTS data. FedKO is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, utilizing a specific federated algorithm to explore a shared Reservoir-Koopman model across diverse datasets. Such a model is then deployable on edge devices for efficient detection of anomalies in local MVTS streams. Experimental results across various datasets showcase FedKO's superior performance against state-of-the-art methods in MVTS anomaly detection. Moreover, FedKO reduces up to 8x communication size and 2x memory usage, making it highly suitable for large-scale systems.</p></details> | Accepted at SDM 2025 |

In this work, we present the time series pattern machine (TSPM), a model designed to excel in a broad range of time series tasks through powerful representation and pattern extraction capabilities. Traditional time series models often struggle to capture universal patterns, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. To address this, we define multiple scales in the time domain and various resolutions in the frequency domain, employing various mixing strategies to extract intricate, task-adaptive time series patterns. Specifically, we introduce a general-purpose TSPM that processes multi-scale time series using (1) multi-resolution time imaging (MRTI), (2) time image decomposition (TID), (3) multi-scale mixing (MCM), and (4) multi-resolution mixing (MRM) to extract comprehensive temporal patterns. MRTI transforms multi-scale time series into multi-resolution time images, capturing patterns across both temporal and frequency domains. TID leverages dual-axis attention to extract seasonal and trend patterns, while MCM hierarchically aggregates these patterns across scales. MRM adaptively integrates all representations across resolutions. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 time series analytical tasks, consistently surpassing both general-purpose and task-specific models. Our work marks a promising step toward the next generation of TSPMs, paving the way for further advancements in time series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Optimal Transport and Adaptive Thresholding for Universal Domain Adaptation on Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11217v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, even when their classes are not fully shared. Few dedicated UniDA methods exist for Time Series (TS), which remains a challenging case. In general, UniDA approaches align common class samples and detect unknown target samples from emerging classes. Such detection often results from thresholding a discriminability metric. The threshold value is typically either a fine-tuned hyperparameter or a fixed value, which limits the ability of the model to adapt to new data. Furthermore, discriminability metrics exhibit overconfidence for unknown samples, leading to misclassifications. This paper introduces UniJDOT, an optimal-transport-based method that accounts for the unknown target samples in the transport cost. Our method also proposes a joint decision space to improve the discriminability of the detection module. In addition, we use an auto-thresholding algorithm to reduce the dependence on fixed or fine-tuned thresholds. Finally, we rely on a Fourier transform-based layer inspired by the Fourier Neural Operator for better TS representation. Experiments on TS benchmarks demonstrate the discriminability, robustness, and state-of-the-art performance of UniJDOT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecasting Empty Container availability for Vehicle Booking System Application](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11728v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Container terminals, pivotal nodes in the network of empty container movement, hold significant potential for enhancing operational efficiency within terminal depots through effective collaboration between transporters and terminal operators. This collaboration is crucial for achieving optimization, leading to streamlined operations and reduced congestion, thereby benefiting both parties. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop the most suitable forecasting approaches to address this challenge. This study focuses on developing and evaluating a data-driven approach for forecasting empty container availability at container terminal depots within a Vehicle Booking System (VBS) framework. It addresses the gap in research concerning optimizing empty container dwell time and aims to enhance operational efficiencies in container terminal operations. Four forecasting models-Naive, ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM-are comprehensively analyzed for their predictive capabilities, with LSTM emerging as the top performer due to its ability to capture complex time series patterns. The research underscores the significance of selecting appropriate forecasting techniques tailored to the specific requirements of container terminal operations, contributing to improved operational planning and management in maritime logistics.</p></details> |  |

Previous works in wireless respiration monitoring have primarily focused on estimating respiration rate, where the breath waveforms are often generated as a by-product. As a result, issues such as waveform deformation and inversion have largely been overlooked, reducing the signal's utility for applications requiring breathing waveforms. To address this problem, we present a novel approach, MobiVital, that improves the quality of respiration waveforms obtained from ultra-wideband (UWB) radar data. MobiVital combines a self-supervised autoregressive model for breathing waveform extraction with a biology-informed algorithm to detect and correct waveform inversions. To encourage reproducible research efforts for developing wireless vital signal monitoring systems, we also release a 12-person, 24-hour UWB radar vital signal dataset, with time-synchronized ground truth obtained from wearable sensors. Our results show that the respiration waveforms produced by our system exhibit a 7-34% increase in fidelity to the ground truth compared to the baselines and can benefit downstream tasks such as respiration rate estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Decision-Making for Digital Twin in Additive Manufacturing with Model Predictive Control using Time-Series Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07601v4)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital Twin -- a virtual replica of a physical system enabling real-time monitoring, model updating, prediction, and decision-making -- combined with recent advances in machine learning, offers new opportunities for proactive control strategies in autonomous manufacturing. However, achieving real-time decision-making with Digital Twins requires efficient optimization driven by accurate predictions of highly nonlinear manufacturing systems. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for real-time decision-making, using a multivariate deep neural network, named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE), as the surrogate model. Unlike conventional MPC models which only provide one-step ahead prediction, TiDE is capable of predicting future states within the prediction horizon in one shot (multi-step), significantly accelerating the MPC. Using Directed Energy Deposition (DED) additive manufacturing as a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC in achieving melt pool temperature tracking to ensure part quality, while reducing porosity defects by regulating laser power to maintain melt pool depth constraints. In this work, we first show that TiDE is capable of accurately predicting melt pool temperature and depth. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed MPC achieves precise temperature tracking while satisfying melt pool depth constraints within a targeted dilution range (10\%-30\%), reducing potential porosity defects. Compared to PID controller, the MPC results in smoother and less fluctuating laser power profiles with competitive or superior melt pool temperature control performance. This demonstrates the MPC's proactive control capabilities, leveraging time-series prediction and real-time optimization, positioning it as a powerful tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process optimization in manufacturing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating System 1 vs. 2 Reasoning Approaches for Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasting: A Benchmark and Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01895v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning ability is crucial for solving challenging tasks. With the advancement of foundation models, such as the emergence of large language models (LLMs), a wide range of reasoning strategies has been proposed, including test-time enhancements, such as Chain-ofThought, and post-training optimizations, as used in DeepSeek-R1. While these reasoning strategies have demonstrated effectiveness across various challenging language or vision tasks, their applicability and impact on time-series forecasting (TSF), particularly the challenging zero-shot TSF, remain largely unexplored. In particular, it is unclear whether zero-shot TSF benefits from reasoning and, if so, what types of reasoning strategies are most effective. To bridge this gap, we propose ReC4TS, the first benchmark that systematically evaluates the effectiveness of popular reasoning strategies when applied to zero-shot TSF tasks. ReC4TS conducts comprehensive evaluations across datasets spanning eight domains, covering both unimodal and multimodal with short-term and longterm forecasting tasks. More importantly, ReC4TS provides key insights: (1) Self-consistency emerges as the most effective test-time reasoning strategy; (2) Group-relative policy optimization emerges as a more suitable approach for incentivizing reasoning ability during post-training; (3) Multimodal TSF benefits more from reasoning strategies compared to unimodal TSF. Beyond these insights, ReC4TS establishes two pioneering starting blocks to support future zero-shot TSF reasoning research: (1) A novel dataset, TimeThinking, containing forecasting samples annotated with reasoning trajectories from multiple advanced LLMs, and (2) A new and simple test-time scaling-law validated on foundational TSF models enabled by self-consistency reasoning strategy.

The practical applications often involve analyzing time-series data alongside contextual information in the form of natural language to support informed decisions. However, current time-series models are limited in their ability to perform reasoning that involves both time-series and their textual content. In this work, we address this gap by introducing \textit{Chat-TS}, a large language model (LLM) based framework, designed to support reasoning over time series and textual data. Unlike traditional models, Chat-TS integrates time-series tokens into LLMs' vocabulary, enhancing its reasoning ability over both modalities without compromising the core natural language capabilities, enabling practical analysis and reasoning across modalities. To support learning and evaluation in this setup, we contribute new datasets: the \textit{TS Instruct Training Dataset} which pairs diverse time-series data with relevant text instructions and responses for instruction tuning, the \textit{TS Instruct Question and Answer (QA) Gold Dataset} which provides multiple-choice questions designed to evaluate multimodal reasoning, and a \textit{TS Instruct Quantitative Probing Set} which contains a small subset of the TS Instruct QA tasks alongside math and decision-making questions for LLM evaluation. We designed a training strategy to preserve the inherent reasoning capabilities of LLMs while augmenting them for time-series reasoning. Experiments show that Chat-TS achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal reasoning tasks by maintaining strong natural language proficiency while improving time-series reasoning. ~\footnote{To ensure replicability and facilitate future research, all models, datasets, and code will be available at [\texttt{Github-URL}].}</p></details> |  |
| **[Mamba time series forecasting with uncertainty propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10873v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State space models, such as Mamba, have recently garnered attention in time series forecasting due to their ability to capture sequence patterns. However, in electricity consumption benchmarks, Mamba forecasts exhibit a mean error of approximately 8\%. Similarly, in traffic occupancy benchmarks, the mean error reaches 18\%. This discrepancy leaves us to wonder whether the prediction is simply inaccurate or falls within error given spread in historical data. To address this limitation, we propose a method to quantify the predictive uncertainty of Mamba forecasts. Here, we propose a dual-network framework based on the Mamba architecture for probabilistic forecasting, where one network generates point forecasts while the other estimates predictive uncertainty by modeling variance. We abbreviate our tool, Mamba with probabilistic time series forecasting, as Mamba-ProbTSF and the code for its implementation is available on GitHub (https://github.com/PessoaP/Mamba-ProbTSF). Evaluating this approach on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, we find Kullback-Leibler divergence between the learned distributions and the data--which, in the limit of infinite data, should converge to zero if the model correctly captures the underlying probability distribution--reduced to the order of $10^{-3}$ for synthetic data and $10^{-1}$ for real-world benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness. We find that in both the electricity consumption and traffic occupancy benchmark, the true trajectory stays within the predicted uncertainty interval at the two-sigma level about 95\% of the time. We end with a consideration of potential limitations, adjustments to improve performance, and considerations for applying this framework to processes for purely or largely stochastic dynamics where the stochastic changes accumulate, as observed for example in pure Brownian motion or molecular dynamics trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Efficient Large Scale Spatial-Temporal Time Series Forecasting via Improved Inverted Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10858v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting at scale presents significant challenges for modern prediction systems, particularly when dealing with large sets of synchronized series, such as in a global payment network. In such systems, three key challenges must be overcome for accurate and scalable predictions: 1) emergence of new entities, 2) disappearance of existing entities, and 3) the large number of entities present in the data. The recently proposed Inverted Transformer (iTransformer) architecture has shown promising results by effectively handling variable entities. However, its practical application in large-scale settings is limited by quadratic time and space complexity ($O(N^2)$) with respect to the number of entities $N$. In this paper, we introduce EiFormer, an improved inverted transformer architecture that maintains the adaptive capabilities of iTransformer while reducing computational complexity to linear scale ($O(N)$). Our key innovation lies in restructuring the attention mechanism to eliminate redundant computations without sacrificing model expressiveness. Additionally, we incorporate a random projection mechanism that not only enhances efficiency but also improves prediction accuracy through better feature representation. Extensive experiments on the public LargeST benchmark dataset and a proprietary large-scale time series dataset demonstrate that EiFormer significantly outperforms existing methods in both computational efficiency and forecasting accuracy. Our approach enables practical deployment of transformer-based forecasting in industrial applications where handling time series at scale is essential.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Upon this, trajectory-controllable video generation has emerged to enable precise object motion control through explicitly defined spatial paths. However, existing methods struggle with complex object movements and multi-object motion control, resulting in imprecise trajectory adherence, poor object consistency, and compromised visual quality. Furthermore, these methods only support trajectory control in a single format, limiting their applicability in diverse scenarios. Additionally, there is no publicly available dataset or benchmark specifically tailored for trajectory-controllable video generation, hindering robust training and systematic evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce MagicMotion, a novel image-to-video generation framework that enables trajectory control through three levels of conditions from dense to sparse: masks, bounding boxes, and sparse boxes. Given an input image and trajectories, MagicMotion seamlessly animates objects along defined trajectories while maintaining object consistency and visual quality. Furthermore, we present MagicData, a large-scale trajectory-controlled video dataset, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering. We also introduce MagicBench, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses both video quality and trajectory control accuracy across different numbers of objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicMotion outperforms previous methods across various metrics.

| **[Loop Closure from Two Views: Revisiting PGO for Scalable Trajectory Estimation through Monocular Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16275v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>(Visual) Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) remains a fundamental challenge in enabling autonomous systems to navigate and understand large-scale environments. Traditional SLAM approaches struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy, particularly in large-scale settings where extensive computational resources are required for scene reconstruction and Bundle Adjustment (BA). However, this scene reconstruction, in the form of sparse pointclouds of visual landmarks, is often only used within the SLAM system because navigation and planning methods require different map representations. In this work, we therefore investigate a more scalable Visual SLAM (VSLAM) approach without reconstruction, mainly based on approaches for two-view loop closures. By restricting the map to a sparse keyframed pose graph without dense geometry representations, our '2GO' system achieves efficient optimization with competitive absolute trajectory accuracy. In particular, we find that recent advancements in image matching and monocular depth priors enable very accurate trajectory optimization from two-view edges. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse datasets, including large-scale scenarios, and provide a detailed analysis of the trade-offs between runtime, accuracy, and map size. Our results demonstrate that this streamlined approach supports real-time performance, scales well in map size and trajectory duration, and effectively broadens the capabilities of VSLAM for long-duration deployments to large environments.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models still face challenges in generating object motions with potentially changing 6D poses under wide-range rotations, due to limited 3D understanding. To address this problem, we introduce PoseTraj, a pose-aware video dragging model for generating 3D-aligned motion from 2D trajectories. Our method adopts a novel two-stage pose-aware pretraining framework, improving 3D understanding across diverse trajectories. Specifically, we propose a large-scale synthetic dataset PoseTraj-10K, containing 10k videos of objects following rotational trajectories, and enhance the model perception of object pose changes by incorporating 3D bounding boxes as intermediate supervision signals. Following this, we fine-tune the trajectory-controlling module on real-world videos, applying an additional camera-disentanglement module to further refine motion accuracy. Experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method not only excels in 3D pose-aligned dragging for rotational trajectories but also outperforms existing baselines in trajectory accuracy and video quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code,...</summary><p>Code, data and project page: https://robingg1.github.io/Pose-Traj/</p></details> |

Without loosing any information, we associate to each state a binary random function, taking values in $\{0,1\}$, and turn the problem of statistical modeling of a categorical process into a multivariate functional data analysis issue. The (multivariate) covariance operator has nice interpretations in terms of departure from independence of the joint probabilities and the multivariate functional principal components are simple to interpret. Under the weak hypothesis assuming only continuity in probability of the $0-1$ trajectories, it is simple to build consistent estimators of the covariance kernel and perform multivariate functional principal components analysis. The sample paths being piecewise constant, with a finite number of jumps, this a rare case in functional data analysis in which the trajectories are not supposed to be continuous and can be observed exhaustively. The approach is illustrated on a data set of sensory perceptions, considering different gustometer-controlled stimuli experiments. We also show how it can be easily extended to analyze experiments, such as temporal check-all-that-apply, in which two states or more can be observed at the same time.</p></details> |  |

We report on a soma design workshop that explored how our bodies could collide with telepresence robots, mobility aids, and a quadruped robot. Based on our findings, we employed soma trajectories to analyse collisions as extended experiences that negotiate key transitions of consent, preparation, launch, contact, ripple, sting, untangle, debris and reflect. We then employed these ideas to analyse two collision experiences, an accidental collision between a person and a drone, and the deliberate design of a robot to play with cats, revealing how real-world collisions involve the complex and ongoing entanglement of soma trajectories. We discuss how viewing collisions as entangled trajectories, or tangles, can be used analytically, as a design approach, and as a lens to broach ethical complexity.</p></details> | 32 pages, 13 figures |

The level of perturbation is determined automatically through analysis of the local loss landscape. Then, we revise the edited NeRF via generative trajectories. Combined with the generative process, we impose identity-preserving gradients to refine the edited NeRF.

However, training advanced trajectory prediction models on large-scale datasets is both time-consuming and computationally expensive. In addition, the imbalanced distribution of driving scenarios often biases models toward data-rich cases, limiting performance in safety-critical, data-scarce conditions. To address these challenges, we propose the Sample Selection for Trajectory Prediction (SSTP) framework, which constructs a compact yet balanced dataset for trajectory prediction. SSTP consists of two main stages (1) Extraction, in which a pretrained trajectory prediction model computes gradient vectors for each sample to capture their influence on parameter updates; and (2) Selection, where a submodular function is applied to greedily choose a representative subset that covers diverse driving scenarios. This approach significantly reduces the dataset size and mitigates scenario imbalance, without sacrificing prediction accuracy and even improving in high-density cases. We evaluate our proposed SSTP on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 benchmarks using a wide range of recent state-of-the-art models. Our experiments demonstrate that SSTP achieves comparable performance to full-dataset training using only half the data while delivering substantial improvements in high-density traffic scenes and significantly reducing training time. Importantly, SSTP exhibits strong generalization and robustness, and the selected subset is model-agnostic, offering a broadly applicable solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse canonical correlation analysis for multiple measurements with latent trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15140v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Canonical Correlation Analysis, CCA, is a widely used multivariate method in omics research for integrating high dimensional datasets. CCA identifies hidden links by deriving linear projections of features maximally correlating datasets. For standard CCA, observations must be independent of each other. As a result, it cannot properly deal with repeated measurements. Current CCA extensions dealing with these challenges either perform CCA on summarized data or estimate correlations for each measurement. While these techniques factor in the correlation between measurements, they are sub-optimal for high dimensional analysis and exploiting this datas longitudinal qualities. We propose a novel extension of sparse CCA that incorporates time dynamics at the latent level through longitudinal models. This approach addresses the correlation of repeated measurements while drawing latent paths, focusing on dynamics in the correlation structures. To aid interpretability and computational efficiency, we implement a penalty to enforce fixed sparsity levels. We estimate these trajectories fitting longitudinal models to the low dimensional latent variables, leveraging the clustered structure of high dimensional datasets, thus exploring shared longitudinal latent mechanisms. Furthermore, modeling time in the latent space significantly reduces computational burden. We validate our models performance using simulated data and show its real world applicability with data from the Human Microbiome Project. Our CCA method for repeated measurements enables efficient estimation of canonical correlations across measurements for clustered data. Compared to existing methods, ours substantially reduces computational time in high dimensional analyses as well as provides longitudinal trajectories that yield interpretable and insightful results.</p></details> | 19 pages, 13 figures |

In each view, a dual-stream trajectory encoder, consisting of a long-term encoder and a short-term encoder, is designed to learn unified trajectory representations that fuse different temporal-spatial dependencies. Then, a TUL layer is used to associate the trajectories with the corresponding users in the representation space using a two-stage training model.

Recent advances in constrained trajectory prediction focus on structured constraints by constructing optimization objectives. However, handling unstructured constraints is challenging due to the lack of differentiable formal definitions. To address this, we propose a novel method for constrained trajectory prediction using a conditional generative paradigm, named Controllable Trajectory Diffusion (CTD). The key idea is that any trajectory corresponds to a degree of conformity to a constraint. By quantifying this degree and treating it as a condition, a model can implicitly learn to predict trajectories under unstructured constraints. CTD employs a pre-trained scoring model to predict the degree of conformity (i.e., a score), and uses this score as a condition for a conditional diffusion model to generate trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that CTD achieves high accuracy on the ETH/UCY and SDD benchmarks. Qualitative analysis confirms that CTD ensures adherence to unstructured constraints and can predict trajectories that satisfy combinatorial constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>has b...</summary><p>has been accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |

| **[TraSCE: Trajectory Steering for Concept Erasure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07658v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have brought them to the public spotlight, becoming widely accessible and embraced by everyday users. However, these models have been shown to generate harmful content such as not-safe-for-work (NSFW) images. While approaches have been proposed to erase such abstract concepts from the models, jail-breaking techniques have succeeded in bypassing such safety measures. In this paper, we propose TraSCE, an approach to guide the diffusion trajectory away from generating harmful content. Our approach is based on negative prompting, but as we show in this paper, a widely used negative prompting strategy is not a complete solution and can easily be bypassed in some corner cases. To address this issue, we first propose using a specific formulation of negative prompting instead of the widely used one. Furthermore, we introduce a localized loss-based guidance that enhances the modified negative prompting technique by steering the diffusion trajectory. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks in removing harmful content, including ones proposed by red teams, and erasing artistic styles and objects. Our proposed approach does not require any training, weight modifications, or training data (either image or prompt), making it easier for model owners to erase new concepts.</p></details> |  |

However, since the solid state diffusional transformations that drive microstructure outcomes are governed by nonlinear ODEs in terms of temperature, which is itself governed by PDEs over the entire part domain, solving for the system inputs needed to achieve desired microstructure distributions has proven difficult. In this work, we present a trajectory optimization approach for spatial control of microstructure in metal AM, which we demonstrate by controlling the hardness of a low-alloy steel in electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF). To this end, we present models for thermal and microstructural dynamics. Next, we use experimental data to identify the parameters of the microstructure transformation dynamics. We then pose spatial microstructure control as a finite-horizon optimal control problem. The optimal power field trajectory is computed using an augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming (AL-DDP) method with GPU acceleration. The resulting time-varying power fields are then realized on an EB-PBF machine through an approximation scheme. Measurements of the resultant hardness shows that the optimized power field trajectory is able to closely produce the desired hardness distribution.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A representational framework for learning and encoding structurally enriched trajectories in complex agent environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13194v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of artificial intelligence agents to make optimal decisions and generalise them to different domains and tasks is compromised in complex scenarios. One way to address this issue has focused on learning efficient representations of the world and on how the actions of agents affect them, such as disentangled representations that exploit symmetries. Whereas such representations are procedurally efficient, they are based on the compression of low-level state-action transitions, which lack structural richness. To address this problem, we propose to enrich the agent's ontology and extend the traditional conceptualisation of trajectories to provide a more nuanced view of task execution. Structurally Enriched Trajectories (SETs) extend the encoding of sequences of states and their transitions by incorporating hierarchical relations between objects, interactions and affordances. SETs are built as multi-level graphs, providing a detailed representation of the agent dynamics and a transferable functional abstraction of the task. SETs are integrated into an architecture, Structurally Enriched Trajectory Learning and Encoding (SETLE), that employs a heterogeneous graph-based memory structure of multi-level relational dependencies essential for generalisation. Using reinforcement learning as a data generation tool, we demonstrate that SETLE can support downstream tasks, enabling agents to recognise task-relevant structural patterns across diverse environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advanced computer vision for extracting georeferenced vehicle trajectories from drone imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02136v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a framework for extracting georeferenced vehicle trajectories from high-altitude drone imagery, addressing key challenges in urban traffic monitoring and the limitations of traditional ground-based systems. Our approach integrates several novel contributions, including a tailored object detector optimized for high-altitude bird's-eye view perspectives, a unique track stabilization method that uses detected vehicle bounding boxes as exclusion masks during image registration, and an orthophoto and master frame-based georeferencing strategy that enhances consistent alignment across multiple drone viewpoints. Additionally, our framework features robust vehicle dimension estimation and detailed road segmentation, enabling comprehensive traffic analysis. Conducted in the Songdo International Business District, South Korea, the study utilized a multi-drone experiment covering 20 intersections, capturing approximately 12TB of 4K video data over four days. The framework produced two high-quality datasets: the Songdo Traffic dataset, comprising approximately 700,000 unique vehicle trajectories, and the Songdo Vision dataset, containing over 5,000 human-annotated images with about 300,000 vehicle instances in four classes. Comparisons with high-precision sensor data from an instrumented probe vehicle highlight the accuracy and consistency of our extraction pipeline in dense urban environments. The public release of Songdo Traffic and Songdo Vision, and the complete source code for the extraction pipeline, establishes new benchmarks in data quality, reproducibility, and scalability in traffic research. Results demonstrate the potential of integrating drone technology with advanced computer vision for precise and cost-effective urban traffic monitoring, providing valuable resources for developing intelligent transportation systems and enhancing traffic management strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Other Vehicle Trajectories Are Also Needed: A Driving World Model Unifies Ego-Other Vehicle Trajectories in Video Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09215v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced end-to-end autonomous driving systems predict other vehicles' motions and plan ego vehicle's trajectory. The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the end-to-end autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In addition, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. To address above issues, a driving World Model named EOT-WM is proposed in this paper, unifying Ego-Other vehicle Trajectories in videos. Specifically, we first project ego and other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate to match each trajectory with its corresponding vehicle in the video. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 30% in FID and 55% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving scenes with self-produced trajectories.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[EMoTive: Event-guided Trajectory Modeling for 3D Motion Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11371v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual 3D motion estimation aims to infer the motion of 2D pixels in 3D space based on visual cues. The key challenge arises from depth variation induced spatio-temporal motion inconsistencies, disrupting the assumptions of local spatial or temporal motion smoothness in previous motion estimation frameworks. In contrast, event cameras offer new possibilities for 3D motion estimation through continuous adaptive pixel-level responses to scene changes. This paper presents EMoTive, a novel event-based framework that models spatio-temporal trajectories via event-guided non-uniform parametric curves, effectively characterizing locally heterogeneous spatio-temporal motion. Specifically, we first introduce Event Kymograph - an event projection method that leverages a continuous temporal projection kernel and decouples spatial observations to encode fine-grained temporal evolution explicitly. For motion representation, we introduce a density-aware adaptation mechanism to fuse spatial and temporal features under event guidance, coupled with a non-uniform rational curve parameterization framework to adaptively model heterogeneous trajectories. The final 3D motion estimation is achieved through multi-temporal sampling of parametric trajectories, yielding optical flow and depth motion fields. To facilitate evaluation, we introduce CarlaEvent3D, a multi-dynamic synthetic dataset for comprehensive validation. Extensive experiments on both this dataset and a real-world benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

The conventional approach is to enforce the dynamic model as a constraint. However, we show this approach leads to significantly redundant operations, as well as being heavily dependent on the state space representation. Specifically, we propose an intrinsic successive convexification methodology for optimal control on smooth manifolds. This so-called iSCvx is then applied to a representative example involving attitude trajectory optimization for a spacecraft subject to non-convex constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[CDKFormer: Contextual Deviation Knowledge-Based Transformer for Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12695v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the future movements of surrounding vehicles is essential for ensuring the safe operation and efficient navigation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in urban traffic environments. Existing vehicle trajectory prediction methods primarily focus on improving overall performance, yet they struggle to address long-tail scenarios effectively. This limitation often leads to poor predictions in rare cases, significantly increasing the risk of safety incidents. Taking Argoverse 2 motion forecasting dataset as an example, we first investigate the long-tail characteristics in trajectory samples from two perspectives, individual motion and group interaction, and deriving deviation features to distinguish abnormal from regular scenarios. On this basis, we propose CDKFormer, a Contextual Deviation Knowledge-based Transformer model for long-tail trajectory prediction. CDKFormer integrates an attention-based scene context fusion module to encode spatiotemporal interaction and road topology. An additional deviation feature fusion module is proposed to capture the dynamic deviations in the target vehicle status. We further introduce a dual query-based decoder, supported by a multi-stream decoder block, to sequentially decode heterogeneous scene deviation features and generate multimodal trajectory predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDKFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly enhancing prediction accuracy and robustness for long-tailed trajectories compared to existing methods, thus advancing the reliability of AVs in complex real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Power Swing Trajectory Influenced by Virtual Impedance-Based Current-Limiting Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12278v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs) can emulate the external characteristics of synchronous generators (SGs) through appropriate control loop design. However, in systems with GFM IBRs, the apparent impedance trajectory under current limitation differs significantly from that of SG-based systems due to the limited overcurrent capability of power electronic devices. This difference challenges the power swing detection functions of distance relays designed for SG-based systems. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the apparent impedance trajectory over a full power swing cycle under two typical current-limiting strategies: variable virtual impedance (VI) and adaptive VI. The analysis reveals that the trajectory under VI current-limiting strategies differs significantly from that of a conventional SG. The results also indicate that the control parameters affect the characteristics of the trajectory. In addition, the new trajectories challenge conventional power swing detection functions, increasing the risk of malfunction. Furthermore, the implementation of VI leads to a deterioration in system stability. The theoretical analysis is further validated through simulations on the MATLAB/Simulink platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[D4orm: Multi-Robot Trajectories with Dynamics-aware Diffusion Denoised Deformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12204v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents an optimization method for generating kinodynamically feasible and collision-free multi-robot trajectories that exploits an incremental denoising scheme in diffusion models. Our key insight is that high-quality trajectories can be discovered merely by denoising noisy trajectories sampled from a distribution. This approach has no learning component, relying instead on only two ingredients: a dynamical model of the robots to obtain feasible trajectories via rollout, and a score function to guide denoising with Monte Carlo gradient approximation. The proposed framework iteratively optimizes the deformation from the previous round with this denoising process, allows \textit{anytime} refinement as time permits, supports different dynamics, and benefits from GPU acceleration. Our evaluations for differential-drive and holonomic teams with up to 16 robots in 2D and 3D worlds show its ability to discover high-quality solutions faster than other black-box optimization methods such as MPPI, approximately three times faster in a 3D holonomic case with 16 robots. As evidence for feasibility, we demonstrate zero-shot deployment of the planned trajectories on eight multirotors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Dataset Distillation by Matching Adversarial Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12069v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset distillation synthesizes compact datasets that enable models to achieve performance comparable to training on the original large-scale datasets. However, existing distillation methods overlook the robustness of the model, resulting in models that are vulnerable to adversarial attacks when trained on distilled data. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of ``robust dataset distillation", a novel paradigm that embeds adversarial robustness into the synthetic datasets during the distillation process. We propose Matching Adversarial Trajectories (MAT), a method that integrates adversarial training into trajectory-based dataset distillation. MAT incorporates adversarial samples during trajectory generation to obtain robust training trajectories, which are then used to guide the distillation process. As experimentally demonstrated, even through natural training on our distilled dataset, models can achieve enhanced adversarial robustness while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to existing distillation methods. Our work highlights robust dataset distillation as a new and important research direction and provides a strong baseline for future research to bridge the gap between efficient training and adversarial robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning a Fast Mixing Exogenous Block MDP using a Single Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03016v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to train agents that can quickly adapt to new objectives or reward functions, efficient unsupervised representation learning in sequential decision-making environments can be important. Frameworks such as the Exogenous Block Markov Decision Process (Ex-BMDP) have been proposed to formalize this representation-learning problem (Efroni et al., 2022b). In the Ex-BMDP framework, the agent's high-dimensional observations of the environment have two latent factors: a controllable factor, which evolves deterministically within a small state space according to the agent's actions, and an exogenous factor, which represents time-correlated noise, and can be highly complex. The goal of the representation learning problem is to learn an encoder that maps from observations into the controllable latent space, as well as the dynamics of this space. Efroni et al. (2022b) has shown that this is possible with a sample complexity that depends only on the size of the controllable latent space, and not on the size of the noise factor. However, this prior work has focused on the episodic setting, where the controllable latent state resets to a specific start state after a finite horizon. By contrast, if the agent can only interact with the environment in a single continuous trajectory, prior works have not established sample-complexity bounds. We propose STEEL, the first provably sample-efficient algorithm for learning the controllable dynamics of an Ex-BMDP from a single trajectory, in the function approximation setting. STEEL has a sample complexity that depends only on the sizes of the controllable latent space and the encoder function class, and (at worst linearly) on the mixing time of the exogenous noise factor. We prove that STEEL is correct and sample-efficient, and demonstrate STEEL on two toy problems. Code is available at: https://github.com/midi-lab/steel.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

While recent Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have reduced the number of required demonstrations, they still rely on expert knowledge to collect high-quality data, limiting scalability and accessibility. We propose Sketch-to-Skill, a novel framework that leverages human-drawn 2D sketch trajectories to bootstrap and guide RL for robotic manipulation. Our approach extends beyond previous sketch-based methods, which were primarily focused on imitation learning or policy conditioning, limited to specific trained tasks. Sketch-to-Skill employs a Sketch-to-3D Trajectory Generator that translates 2D sketches into 3D trajectories, which are then used to autonomously collect initial demonstrations. We utilize these sketch-generated demonstrations in two ways: to pre-train an initial policy through behavior cloning and to refine this policy through RL with guided exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that Sketch-to-Skill achieves ~96% of the performance of the baseline model that leverages teleoperated demonstration data, while exceeding the performance of a pure reinforcement learning policy by ~170%, only from sketch inputs. This makes robotic manipulation learning more accessible and potentially broadens its applications across various domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Peiho...</summary><p>Peihong Yu and Amisha Bhaskar contributed equally to this work</p></details> |
| **[Curves Ahead: Enhancing the Steering Law for Complex Curved Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11914v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Steering Law has long been a fundamental model in predicting movement time for tasks involving navigating through constrained paths, such as in selecting sub-menu options, particularly for straight and circular arc trajectories. However, this does not reflect the complexities of real-world tasks where curvatures can vary arbitrarily, limiting its applications. This study aims to address this gap by introducing the total curvature parameter K into the equation to account for the overall curviness characteristic of a path. To validate this extension, we conducted a mouse-steering experiment on fixed-width paths with varying lengths and curviness levels. Our results demonstrate that the introduction of K significantly improves model fitness for movement time prediction over traditional models. These findings advance our understanding of movement in complex environments and support potential applications in fields like speech motor control and virtual navigation.</p></details> |  |

However, optimization-based real-time motion planning becomes increasingly challenging due to the problem's probable non-convexity and the inherent limitations of Non-Linear Programming algorithms. Highly nonlinear dynamics, obstacle avoidance constraints, and non-convex inputs can exacerbate these difficulties. To address these hurdles, this paper proposes a two-layer optimization algorithm for 2D vehicles by dynamically reformulating small time horizon convex programming subproblems, aiming to provide real-time guarantees for trajectory optimization. Our approach involves breaking down the original problem into small horizon-based planning cycles with fixed final times, referred to as planning cycles. Each planning cycle is then solved within a series of restricted convex sets identified by our customized search algorithms incrementally. The key benefits of our proposed algorithm include fast computation speeds and lower task time. We demonstrate these advantages through mathematical proofs under some moderate preconditions and experimental results.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, the potential of transformer-based diffusion models for effectively generating videos with controllable motion remains an area of limited exploration. This paper introduces Tora, the first trajectory-oriented DiT framework that concurrently integrates textual, visual, and trajectory conditions, thereby enabling scalable video generation with effective motion guidance. Specifically, Tora consists of a Trajectory Extractor (TE), a Spatial-Temporal DiT, and a Motion-guidance Fuser (MGF). The TE encodes arbitrary trajectories into hierarchical spacetime motion patches with a 3D motion compression network. The MGF integrates the motion patches into the DiT blocks to generate consistent videos that accurately follow designated trajectories. Our design aligns seamlessly with DiT's scalability, allowing precise control of video content's dynamics with diverse durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Tora excels in achieving high motion fidelity compared to the foundational DiT model, while also accurately simulating the complex movements of the physical world.

This paper introduces Trajectory Mamba, a novel efficient trajectory prediction framework based on the selective state-space model (SSM). Conventional attention-based models face the challenge of computational costs that grow quadratically with the number of targets, hindering their application in highly dynamic environments. In response, we leverage the SSM to redesign the self-attention mechanism in the encoder-decoder architecture, thereby achieving linear time complexity. To address the potential reduction in prediction accuracy resulting from modifications to the attention mechanism, we propose a joint polyline encoding strategy to better capture the associations between static and dynamic contexts, ultimately enhancing prediction accuracy. Additionally, to balance prediction accuracy and inference speed, we adopted the decoder that differs entirely from the encoder. Through cross-state space attention, all target agents share the scene context, allowing the SSM to interact with the shared scene representation during decoding, thus inferring different trajectories over the next prediction steps. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of inference speed and parameter efficiency on both the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets. It demonstrates a four-fold reduction in FLOPs compared to existing methods and reduces parameter count by over 40% while surpassing the performance of the vast majority of previous methods. These findings validate the effectiveness of Trajectory Mamba in trajectory prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

The ASV exhibits cyclic operation due to the nature of the solar profile, but weather patterns create inevitable disturbances in this profile. The nature of the problem results in a formulation where the satisfaction of pointwise-in-time state of charge constraints does not generally guarantee persistent feasibility, and the goal is to maximize information gathered over a very long (ultimately persistent) time duration. To address these challenges, we first use barrier functions to tighten pointwise-in-time state of charge constraints by the minimal amount necessary to achieve persistent feasibility. We then use indirect methods to derive a simple switching control law, where the optimal velocity is shown to be an undetermined constant value during each constraint-inactive time segment. To identify this optimal constant velocity (which can vary from one segment to the next), we employ an iterative learning approach. The result is a simple closed-form control law that does not require a solar forecast. We present simulation-based validation results, based on a model of the SeaTrac SP-48 ASV and solar data from the North Carolina coast. These simulation results show that the proposed methodology, which amounts to a closed-form controller and simple iterative learning update law, performs nearly as well as a model predictive control approach that requires an accurate future solar forecast and significantly greater computational capability.</p></details> |  |

Diseases evolve dynamically over time, and studying longitudinal observations of specific biomarkers can help to understand patients response to treatment and predict disease progression. We propose a novel iterative regression-based method to estimate changes in patients status within a cohort that includes censored patients, and illustrate it on clinical data from myeloma cases. We formulate the relapse time estimation problem in the framework of Piecewise Deterministic Markov processes (PDMP), where the Euclidean component is a surrogate biomarker for patient state. This approach enables continuous-time estimation of the status-change dates, which in turn allows for accurate inference of the relapse time distribution. A key challenge lies in the partial observability of the process, a complexity that has been rarely addressed in previous studies. . We evaluate the performance of our procedure through a simulation study and compare it with different approaches. This work is a proof of concept on biomarker trajectories with simple behaviour, but our method can easily be extended to more complex dynamics.</p></details> |  |

TrajHF incorporates multi-conditional denoiser and reinforcement learning with human feedback to refine multi-modal trajectory generation beyond conventional imitation learning. This enables better alignment with human driving preferences while maintaining safety and feasibility constraints. TrajHF achieves PDMS of 93.95 on NavSim benchmark, significantly exceeding other methods.

| **[GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05689v3)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

Key operations such as conflict detection and resolution, aircraft anomaly monitoring, and the management of congested flight paths are increasingly reliant on this foundational technology, underscoring the urgent demand for intelligent solutions. The dynamics in airport terminal zones and crowded airspaces are intricate and ever-changing; however, current methodologies do not sufficiently account for the interactions among aircraft. To tackle these challenges, we propose DA-STGCN, an innovative spatiotemporal graph convolutional network that integrates a dual attention mechanism. Our model reconstructs the adjacency matrix through a self-attention approach, enhancing the capture of node correlations, and employs graph attention to distill spatiotemporal characteristics, thereby generating a probabilistic distribution of predicted trajectories. This novel adjacency matrix, reconstructed with the self-attention mechanism, is dynamically optimized throughout the network's training process, offering a more nuanced reflection of the inter-node relationships compared to traditional algorithms. The performance of the model is validated on two ADS-B datasets, one near the airport terminal area and the other in dense airspace. Experimental results demonstrate a notable improvement over current 4D trajectory prediction methods, achieving a 20% and 30% reduction in the Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), respectively. The incorporation of a Dual-Attention module has been shown to significantly enhance the extraction of node correlations, as verified by ablation experiments.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel motion prediction conditional flow matching model, termed MoFlow, to predict K-shot future trajectories for all agents in a given scene. We design a novel flow matching loss function that not only ensures at least one of the $K$ sets of future trajectories is accurate but also encourages all $K$ sets of future trajectories to be diverse and plausible. Furthermore, by leveraging the implicit maximum likelihood estimation (IMLE), we propose a novel distillation method for flow models that only requires samples from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the real-world datasets, including SportVU NBA games, ETH-UCY, and SDD, demonstrate that both our teacher flow model and the IMLE-distilled student model achieve state-of-the-art performance. These models can generate diverse trajectories that are physically and socially plausible. Moreover, our one-step student model is $\textbf{100}$ times faster than the teacher flow model during sampling.

| **[Finding the Muses: Identifying Coresets through Loss Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09721v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To address this, we propose Loss Trajectory Correlation (LTC), a novel metric for coreset selection that identifies critical training samples driving generalization. $LTC$ quantifies the alignment between training sample loss trajectories and validation set loss trajectories, enabling the construction of compact, representative subsets. Unlike traditional methods with computational and storage overheads that are infeasible to scale to large datasets, $LTC$ achieves superior efficiency as it can be computed as a byproduct of training. Our results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k show that $LTC$ consistently achieves accuracy on par with or surpassing state-of-the-art coreset selection methods, with any differences remaining under 1%. LTC also effectively transfers across various architectures, including ResNet, VGG, DenseNet, and Swin Transformer, with minimal performance degradation (<2%). Additionally, LTC offers insights into training dynamics, such as identifying aligned and conflicting sample behaviors, at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional methods. This framework paves the way for scalable coreset selection and efficient dataset optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Post-interactive Multimodal Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09366v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling the interactions among agents for trajectory prediction of autonomous driving has been challenging due to the inherent uncertainty in agents' behavior. The interactions involved in the predicted trajectories of agents, also called post-interactions, have rarely been considered in trajectory prediction models. To this end, we propose a coarse-to-fine Transformer for multimodal trajectory prediction, i.e., Pioformer, which explicitly extracts the post-interaction features to enhance the prediction accuracy. Specifically, we first build a Coarse Trajectory Network to generate coarse trajectories based on the observed trajectories and lane segments, in which the low-order interaction features are extracted with the graph neural networks. Next, we build a hypergraph neural network-based Trajectory Proposal Network to generate trajectory proposals, where the high-order interaction features are learned by the hypergraphs. Finally, the trajectory proposals are sent to the Proposal Refinement Network for further refinement. The observed trajectories and trajectory proposals are concatenated together as the inputs of the Proposal Refinement Network, in which the post-interaction features are learned by combining the previous interaction features and trajectory consistency features. Moreover, we propose a three-stage training scheme to facilitate the learning process. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method. Compared with the baseline HiVT-64, our model has reduced the prediction errors by 4.4%, 8.4%, 14.4%, 5.7% regarding metrics minADE6, minFDE6, MR6, and brier-minFDE6, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, existing fault-tolerant control methods exhibit significant oscillations during docking and separation, impacting system stability. To address this issue, we propose a novel fault-tolerant control reallocation method that adapts to arbitrary number of modular robots and their assembly formations. The algorithm redistributes the expected collective force and torque required for MARS to individual unit according to their moment arm relative to the center of MARS mass. Furthermore, We propose an agile trajectory planning method for MARS of arbitrary configurations, which is collision-avoiding and dynamically feasible. Our work represents the first comprehensive approach to enable fault-tolerant and collision avoidance flight for MARS. We validate our method through extensive simulations, demonstrating improved fault tolerance, enhanced trajectory tracking accuracy, and greater robustness in cluttered environments.

| **[Learning Few-Step Diffusion Models by Trajectory Distribution Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06674v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accelerating diffusion model sampling is crucial for efficient AIGC deployment. While diffusion distillation methods -- based on distribution matching and trajectory matching -- reduce sampling to as few as one step, they fall short on complex tasks like text-to-image generation. Few-step generation offers a better balance between speed and quality, but existing approaches face a persistent trade-off: distribution matching lacks flexibility for multi-step sampling, while trajectory matching often yields suboptimal image quality. To bridge this gap, we propose learning few-step diffusion models by Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM), a unified distillation paradigm that combines the strengths of distribution and trajectory matching. Our method introduces a data-free score distillation objective, aligning the student's trajectory with the teacher's at the distribution level. Further, we develop a sampling-steps-aware objective that decouples learning targets across different steps, enabling more adjustable sampling. This approach supports both deterministic sampling for superior image quality and flexible multi-step adaptation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with remarkable efficiency. Our model, TDM, outperforms existing methods on various backbones, such as SDXL and PixArt-$\alpha$, delivering superior quality and significantly reduced training costs. In particular, our method distills PixArt-$\alpha$ into a 4-step generator that outperforms its teacher on real user preference at 1024 resolution. This is accomplished with 500 iterations and 2 A800 hours -- a mere 0.01% of the teacher's training cost. In addition, our proposed TDM can be extended to accelerate text-to-video diffusion. Notably, TDM can outperform its teacher model (CogVideoX-2B) by using only 4 NFE on VBench, improving the total score from 80.91 to 81.65.

While prior work established the worst case optimality of standard flow matching under Wasserstein distances, the theoretical guarantees for higher-order flow matching - which incorporates acceleration terms to refine sample trajectories - remain unexplored. In this paper, we bridge this gap by proving that higher-order flow matching preserves worst case optimality as a distribution estimator. We derive upper bounds on the estimation error for second-order flow matching, demonstrating that the convergence rates depend polynomially on the smoothness of the target distribution (quantified via Besov spaces) and key parameters of the ODE dynamics. Our analysis employs neural network approximations with carefully controlled depth, width, and sparsity to bound acceleration errors across both small and large time intervals, ultimately unifying these results into a general worst case optimal bound for all time steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2410.11261</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a novel framework for simultaneously designing trajectories of robots, objects, and contacts efficiently for contact-rich manipulation. We propose a hierarchical optimization framework where Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) selects optimal contacts between robot \& object using approximate dynamical constraints, and then a NonLinear Program (NLP) optimizes trajectory of the robot(s) and object considering full nonlinear constraints. We present a convex relaxation of bilinear constraints using binary encoding technique such that MILP can provide tighter solutions with better computational complexity. The proposed framework is evaluated on various manipulation tasks where it can reason about complex multi-contact interactions while providing computational advantages.

Both these tasks are crucial for automation and assistance in endoscopy surgery. Given the safety-critical nature of these tasks, reliable uncertainty quantification is essential. Conformal prediction is a fast-growing and widely recognized framework for uncertainty estimation in machine learning and computer vision, offering distribution-free, theoretically valid prediction intervals. In this work, we explore the application of standard conformal prediction and conformalized quantile regression to estimate uncertainty in forecasting surgical instrument motion, i.e., predicting direction and magnitude of surgical instruments' future motion. We analyze and compare their coverage and interval sizes, assessing the impact of multiple hypothesis testing and correction methods. Additionally, we show how these techniques can be employed to produce useful uncertainty heatmaps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study applying conformal prediction to surgical guidance, marking an initial step toward constructing principled prediction intervals with formal coverage guarantees in this domain.</p></details> |  |

This sampling method yields trajectory samples that are tightly clustered around a mean trajectory. This clustering behavior in turn, limits the exploration capability of the controller and reduces the likelihood of finding feasible solutions in complex environments. Recent work has attempted to address this problem by either reshaping the resulting trajectory distribution or increasing the sample entropy to enhance diversity and promote exploration. In our recent work, we introduced the concept of C-Uniform trajectory generation [1] which allows the computation of control input probabilities to generate trajectories that sample the configuration space uniformly. In this work, we first address the main limitation of this method: lack of scalability due to computational complexity. We introduce Neural C-Uniform, an unsupervised C-Uniform trajectory sampler that mitigates scalability issues by computing control input probabilities without relying on a discretized configuration space. Experiments show that Neural C-Uniform achieves a similar uniformity ratio to the original C-Uniform approach and generates trajectories over a longer time horizon while preserving uniformity. Next, we present CU-MPPI, which integrates Neural C-Uniform sampling into existing MPPI variants. We analyze the performance of CU-MPPI in simulation and real-world experiments. Our results indicate that in settings where the optimal solution has high curvature, CU-MPPI leads to drastic improvements in performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS2025</p></details> |

While learning-based prediction models have shown success in generating likely human trajectory predictions, integrating these stochastic models into a robot controller presents several challenges. The controller needs to account for interactive coupling between planned robot motion and human predictions while ensuring both predictions and robot actions are safe (i.e. collision-free). To address these challenges, we present a receding horizon crowd navigation method for single-robot multi-human environments. We first propose a diffusion model to generate joint trajectory predictions for all humans in the scene. We then incorporate these multi-modal predictions into a SICNav Bilevel MPC problem that simultaneously solves for a robot plan (upper-level) and acts as a safety filter to refine the predictions for non-collision (lower-level). Combining planning and prediction refinement into one bilevel problem ensures that the robot plan and human predictions are coupled. We validate the open-loop trajectory prediction performance of our diffusion model on the commonly used ETH/UCY benchmark and evaluate the closed-loop performance of our robot navigation method in simulation and extensive real-robot experiments demonstrating safe, efficient, and reactive robot motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Trajectory Prediction with Multi-View Data Integration in Cooperative Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00374v3)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current research on trajectory prediction primarily relies on data collected by onboard sensors of an ego vehicle. With the rapid advancement in connected technologies, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, valuable information from alternate views becomes accessible via wireless networks. The integration of information from alternative views has the potential to overcome the inherent limitations associated with a single viewpoint, such as occlusions and limited field of view. In this work, we introduce V2INet, a novel trajectory prediction framework designed to model multi-view data by extending existing single-view models. Unlike previous approaches where the multi-view data is manually fused or formulated as a separate training stage, our model supports end-to-end training, enhancing both flexibility and performance. Moreover, the predicted multimodal trajectories are calibrated by a post-hoc conformal prediction module to get valid and efficient confidence regions. We evaluated the entire framework using the real-world V2I dataset V2X-Seq. Our results demonstrate superior performance in terms of Final Displacement Error (FDE) and Miss Rate (MR) using a single GPU.

Current evaluation tasks like VQA and visual grounding remain too coarse to assess fine-grained pixel comprehension accurately. Though segmentation is foundational for pixel-level understanding, existing methods often require MLLMs to generate implicit tokens, decoded through external pixel decoders. This approach disrupts the MLLM's text output space, potentially compromising language capabilities and reducing flexibility and extensibility, while failing to reflect the model's intrinsic pixel-level understanding. Thus, we introduce the Human-Like Mask Annotation Task (HLMAT), a new paradigm where MLLMs mimic human annotators using interactive segmentation tools. Modeling segmentation as a multi-step Markov Decision Process, HLMAT enables MLLMs to iteratively generate text-based click points, achieving high-quality masks without architectural changes or implicit tokens. Through this setup, we develop SegAgent, a model fine-tuned on human-like annotation trajectories, which achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and supports additional tasks like mask refinement and annotation filtering. HLMAT provides a protocol for assessing fine-grained pixel understanding in MLLMs and introduces a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making task that facilitates exploration of MLLMs' visual reasoning abilities. Our adaptations of policy improvement method StaR and PRM-guided tree search further enhance model robustness in complex segmentation tasks, laying a foundation for future advancements in fine-grained visual perception and multi-step decision-making for MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2025;Code will be released at \url{https://github.com/aim-uofa/SegAgent}</p></details> |
| **[Collaborative Uncertainty Benefits Multi-Agent Multi-Modal Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05195v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multi-modal multi-agent trajectory forecasting, two major challenges have not been fully tackled: 1) how to measure the uncertainty brought by the interaction module that causes correlations among the predicted trajectories of multiple agents; 2) how to rank the multiple predictions and select the optimal predicted trajectory. In order to handle these challenges, this work first proposes a novel concept, collaborative uncertainty (CU), which models the uncertainty resulting from interaction modules. Then we build a general CU-aware regression framework with an original permutation-equivariant uncertainty estimator to do both tasks of regression and uncertainty estimation. Further, we apply the proposed framework to current SOTA multi-agent multi-modal forecasting systems as a plugin module, which enables the SOTA systems to 1) estimate the uncertainty in the multi-agent multi-modal trajectory forecasting task; 2) rank the multiple predictions and select the optimal one based on the estimated uncertainty. We conduct extensive experiments on a synthetic dataset and two public large-scale multi-agent trajectory forecasting benchmarks. Experiments show that: 1) on the synthetic dataset, the CU-aware regression framework allows the model to appropriately approximate the ground-truth Laplace distribution; 2) on the multi-agent trajectory forecasting benchmarks, the CU-aware regression framework steadily helps SOTA systems improve their performances. Specially, the proposed framework helps VectorNet improve by 262 cm regarding the Final Displacement Error of the chosen optimal prediction on the nuScenes dataset; 3) for multi-agent multi-modal trajectory forecasting systems, prediction uncertainty is positively correlated with future stochasticity; and 4) the estimated CU values are highly related to the interactive information among agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2110.13947</p></details> |

In contrast, simple robotic grippers have low dexterity and fail to handle small objects effectively. This is why many automation tasks remain unsolved by robots. This paper presents an optimization-based framework for in-hand manipulation with a robotic hand equipped with compact Magnetic Tactile Sensors (MTSs). The small form factor of the robotic hand from Shadow Robot introduces challenges in estimating the state of the object while satisfying contact constraints. To address this, we formulate a trajectory optimization problem using Nonlinear Programming (NLP) for finger movements while ensuring contact points to change along the geometry of the fingers. Using the optimized trajectory from the solver, we implement and test an open-loop controller for rolling motion. To further enhance robustness and accuracy, we introduce a force controller for the fingers and a state estimator for the object utilizing MTSs. The proposed framework is validated through comparative experiments, showing that incorporating the force control with compliance consideration improves the accuracy and robustness of the rolling motion. Rolling an object with the force controller is 30\% more likely to succeed than running an open-loop controller.

Current OV-MOT methods typically rely primarily on instance-level detection and association, often overlooking trajectory information that is unique and essential for object tracking tasks. Utilizing trajectory information can enhance association stability and classification accuracy, especially in cases of occlusion and category ambiguity, thereby improving adaptability to novel classes. Thus motivated, in this paper we propose \textbf{TRACT}, an open-vocabulary tracker that leverages trajectory information to improve both object association and classification in OV-MOT. Specifically, we introduce a \textit{Trajectory Consistency Reinforcement} (\textbf{TCR}) strategy, that benefits tracking performance by improving target identity and category consistency. In addition, we present \textbf{TraCLIP}, a plug-and-play trajectory classification module. It integrates \textit{Trajectory Feature Aggregation} (\textbf{TFA}) and \textit{Trajectory Semantic Enrichment} (\textbf{TSE}) strategies to fully leverage trajectory information from visual and language perspectives for enhancing the classification results. Extensive experiments on OV-TAO show that our TRACT significantly improves tracking performance, highlighting trajectory information as a valuable asset for OV-MOT.

While motion capabilities and accurate localization for automated robots have rapidly developed, the challenge remains to generate efficient, smooth, comprehensive, and high-quality trajectories in these areas. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient planner for ground robots to autonomously navigate in large complex multi-layered architectural spaces. Considering that traversable regions typically include ground, slopes, and stairs, which are planar or nearly planar structures, we simplify the problem to navigation within and between complex intersecting planes. We first extract traversable planes from 3D point clouds through segmenting, merging, classifying, and connecting to build a plane-graph, which is lightweight but fully represents the traversable regions. We then build a trajectory optimization based on motion state trajectory and fully consider special constraints when crossing multi-layer planes to maximize the robot's maneuverability.

Due to the inherent uncertainty in vessel behavior, trajectory prediction systems must adopt a multimodal approach to accurately model potential future motion states. However, existing vessel trajectory prediction methods lack the ability to comprehensively model behavioral multi-modality. To better capture multimodal behavior in interactive scenarios, we propose modeling interactions as dynamic graphs, replacing traditional aggregation-based techniques that rely on vessel states. By leveraging the natural multimodal capabilities of diffusion models, we frame the trajectory prediction task as an inverse process of motion uncertainty diffusion, wherein uncertainties across potential navigational areas are progressively eliminated until the desired trajectories is produced. In summary, we pioneer the integration of Spatio-Temporal Graph (STG) with diffusion models in ship trajectory prediction.

Ergodic trajectory optimization is an effective approach that generates coverage paths for problems related to robotic inspection, information gathering problems, and search and rescue. These optimization schemes compel the robot to spend time in a region proportional to the expected utility of visiting that region. Current methods for ergodic trajectory optimization rely on domain-specific knowledge, e.g., a defined utility map, and well-defined spatial basis functions to produce ergodic trajectories. Here, we present a generalization of ergodic trajectory optimization based on maximum mean discrepancy that requires only samples from the search domain. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to produce coverage trajectories on a variety of problem domains including robotic inspection of objects with differential kinematics constraints and on Lie groups without having access to domain specific knowledge. Furthermore, we show favorable computational scaling compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for ergodic trajectory optimization with a trade-off between domain specific knowledge and computational scaling, thus extending the versatility of ergodic coverage on a wider application domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages (excluding references), 1 table, 8 figures, submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Previous methods often struggle with content leakage and style misalignment, particularly when using image-driven approaches that aim to transfer precise styles. In this work, we introduce Trajectory Reset Attention Control (TRAC), a novel method that allows for high-quality style transfer while preserving content integrity. TRAC operates by resetting the denoising trajectory and enforcing attention control, thus enhancing content consistency while significantly reducing the computational costs against inversion-based methods. Additionally, a concept termed Style Medium is introduced to bridge the gap between content and style, enabling a more precise and harmonious transfer of stylistic elements. Building upon these concepts, we present a tuning-free framework that offers a stable, flexible, and efficient solution for both image and video style transfer. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework accommodates a wide range of stylized outputs, from precise content preservation to the production of visually striking results with vibrant and expressive styles.</p></details> |  |

| **[Resonance: Learning to Predict Social-Aware Pedestrian Trajectories as Co-Vibrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02447v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning to forecast trajectories of intelligent agents has caught much more attention recently. However, it remains a challenge to accurately account for agents' intentions and social behaviors when forecasting, and in particular, to simulate the unique randomness within each of those components in an explainable and decoupled way. Inspired by vibration systems and their resonance properties, we propose the Resonance (short for Re) model to encode and forecast pedestrian trajectories in the form of ``co-vibrations''. It decomposes trajectory modifications and randomnesses into multiple vibration portions to simulate agents' reactions to each single cause, and forecasts trajectories as the superposition of these independent vibrations separately. Also, benefiting from such vibrations and their spectral properties, representations of social interactions can be learned by emulating the resonance phenomena, further enhancing its explainability. Experiments on multiple datasets have verified its usefulness both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scene-Aware Explainable Multimodal Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16795v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in intelligent technologies have significantly improved navigation in complex traffic environments by enhancing environment perception and trajectory prediction for automated vehicles. However, current research often overlooks the joint reasoning of scenario agents and lacks explainability in trajectory prediction models, limiting their practical use in real-world situations. To address this, we introduce the Explainable Conditional Diffusion-based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction (DMTP) model, which is designed to elucidate the environmental factors influencing predictions and reveal the underlying mechanisms. Our model integrates a modified conditional diffusion approach to capture multimodal trajectory patterns and employs a revised Shapley Value model to assess the significance of global and scenario-specific features. Experiments using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our explainable model excels in identifying critical inputs and significantly outperforms baseline models in accuracy. Moreover, the factors identified align with the human driving experience, underscoring the model's effectiveness in learning accurate predictions.

Specifically, we use a GMM to model the multimodal behaviors of obstacles' uncertain states. Then, we develop a mixed-integer conic approximation to the chance-constrained trajectory planning problem with deterministic linear systems and polyhedral obstacles. When the GMM moments are estimated via finite samples, we develop a tight concentration bound to ensure the chance constraint with a desired confidence. Moreover, to limit the amount of constraint violation, we develop a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) approach corresponding to the chance constraints and derive a tractable approximation for known and estimated GMM moments. We verify our methods with state-of-the-art trajectory prediction algorithms and autonomous driving datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Control Systems Letters</p></details> |

We propose a novel framework, RealTraj, that enhances the real-world applicability of trajectory forecasting. Our approach includes two training phases -- self-supervised pretraining on synthetic data and weakly-supervised fine-tuning with limited real-world data -- to minimize data collection efforts. To improve robustness to real-world errors, we focus on both model design and training objectives. Specifically, we present Det2TrajFormer, a trajectory forecasting model that remains invariant to tracking noise by using past detections as inputs. Additionally, we pretrain the model using multiple pretext tasks, which enhance robustness and improve forecasting performance based solely on detection data. Unlike previous trajectory forecasting methods, our approach fine-tunes the model using only ground-truth detections, reducing the need for costly person ID annotations. In the experiments, we comprehensively verify the effectiveness of the proposed method against the limitations, and the method outperforms state-of-the-art trajectory forecasting methods on multiple datasets. The code will be released at https://fujiry0.github.io/RealTraj-project-page.</p></details> |  |
| **[DAWN-ICL: Strategic Planning of Problem-solving Trajectories for Zero-Shot In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20215v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot in-context learning (ZS-ICL) aims to conduct in-context learning (ICL) without using human-annotated demonstrations. Most ZS-ICL methods use large language models (LLMs) to generate (input, label) pairs as pseudo-demonstrations and leverage historical pseudo-demonstrations to help solve the current problem. They assume that problems are from the same task and traverse them in a random order. However, in real-world scenarios, problems usually come from diverse tasks, and only a few belong to the same task. The random traversing order may generate unreliable pseudo-demonstrations and lead to error accumulation. To address this problem, we reformulate ZS-ICL as a planning problem and propose a Demonstration-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) approach (DAWN-ICL), which leverages MCTS to strategically plan the problem-solving trajectories for ZS-ICL. In addition, to achieve effective and efficient Q value estimation, we propose a novel demonstration-aware Q-value function and use it to enhance the selection phase and accelerate the expansion and simulation phases in MCTS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DAWN-ICL on in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, and it even outperforms ICL using human-annotated labels.

This work proposes the Fast and Safe Data-Driven Planner to address this challenge. Sparse Gaussian predictions are introduced to improve both the computational efficiency and accuracy of opponent predictions. Furthermore, the proposed approach employs a bi-level quadratic programming framework to generate an overtaking trajectory leveraging the opponent predictions. The first level uses polynomial fitting to generate a rough trajectory, from which reference states and control inputs are derived for the second level. The second level formulates a model predictive control optimization problem in the Frenet frame, generating a trajectory that satisfies both kinematic feasibility and safety. Experimental results on the F1TENTH platform show that our method outperforms the State-of-the-Art, achieving an 8.93% higher overtaking success rate, allowing the maximum opponent speed, ensuring a smoother ego trajectory, and reducing 74.04% computational time compared to the Predictive Spliner method.

| **[NLP-enabled Trajectory Map-matching in Urban Road Networks using a Transformer-based Encoder-decoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12460v4)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicular trajectory data from geolocation telematics is vital for analyzing urban mobility patterns. Map-matching aligns noisy, sparsely sampled GPS trajectories with digital road maps to reconstruct accurate vehicle paths. Traditional methods rely on geometric proximity, topology, and shortest-path heuristics, but they overlook two key factors: (1) drivers may prefer routes based on local road characteristics rather than shortest paths, revealing learnable shared preferences, and (2) GPS noise varies spatially due to multipath effects. These factors can reduce the effectiveness of conventional methods in complex scenarios and increase the effort required for heuristic-based implementations. This study introduces a data-driven, deep learning-based map-matching framework, formulating the task as machine translation, inspired by NLP. Specifically, a transformer-based encoder-decoder model learns contextual representations of noisy GPS points to infer trajectory behavior and road structures in an end-to-end manner. Trained on large-scale trajectory data, the method improves path estimation accuracy. Experiments on synthetic trajectories show that this approach outperforms conventional methods by integrating contextual awareness. Evaluation on real-world GPS traces from Manhattan, New York, achieves 75% accuracy in reconstructing navigated routes. These results highlight the effectiveness of transformers in capturing drivers' trajectory behaviors, spatial dependencies, and noise patterns, offering a scalable, robust solution for map-matching. This work contributes to advancing trajectory-driven foundation models for geospatial modeling and urban mobility applications.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

By disentangling deterministic view transformations from stochastic content generation, our method achieves precise control over user-specified camera trajectories. We propose a novel dual-stream conditional video diffusion model that concurrently integrates point cloud renders and source videos as conditions, ensuring accurate view transformations and coherent 4D content generation. Instead of leveraging scarce multi-view videos, we curate a hybrid training dataset combining web-scale monocular videos with static multi-view datasets, by our innovative double-reprojection strategy, significantly fostering robust generalization across diverse scenes.

In this paper, inspired by topological planning, we propose a differentiable local homotopy invariant metric to model the interactions. By incorporating this topological metric as a constraint into multi-vehicle trajectory optimization, our framework is capable of generating multiple interactive trajectories from the same initial values, achieving controllable interactions as well as supporting user-designed interaction patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior optimality and efficiency over existing methods. We will release open-source code to advance relative research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Trajectory Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15429v3)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[Evidential Uncertainty Estimation for Multi-Modal Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05274v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, yet uncertainty in agent behavior and perception noise makes it inherently challenging. While multi-modal trajectory prediction models generate multiple plausible future paths with associated probabilities, effectively quantifying uncertainty remains an open problem. In this work, we propose a novel multi-modal trajectory prediction approach based on evidential deep learning that estimates both positional and mode probability uncertainty in real time. Our approach leverages a Normal Inverse Gamma distribution for positional uncertainty and a Dirichlet distribution for mode uncertainty. Unlike sampling-based methods, it infers both types of uncertainty in a single forward pass, significantly improving efficiency. Additionally, we experimented with uncertainty-driven importance sampling to improve training efficiency by prioritizing underrepresented high-uncertainty samples over redundant ones. We perform extensive evaluations of our method on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets, demonstrating that it provides reliable uncertainty estimates while maintaining high trajectory prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

While diffusion models have shown promise in planning, they are limited to solving tasks similar to those seen in their training data. We propose CompDiffuser, a novel generative approach that can solve new tasks by learning to compositionally stitch together shorter trajectory chunks from previously seen tasks. Our key insight is modeling the trajectory distribution by subdividing it into overlapping chunks and learning their conditional relationships through a single bidirectional diffusion model. This allows information to propagate between segments during generation, ensuring physically consistent connections. We conduct experiments on benchmark tasks of various difficulties, covering different environment sizes, agent state dimension, trajectory types, training data quality, and show that CompDiffuser significantly outperforms existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://comp-diffuser.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Curb Your Attention: Causal Attention Gating for Robust Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07191v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction models in autonomous driving are vulnerable to perturbations from non-causal agents whose actions should not affect the ego-agent's behavior. Such perturbations can lead to incorrect predictions of other agents' trajectories, potentially compromising the safety and efficiency of the ego-vehicle's decision-making process. Motivated by this challenge, we propose $\textit{Causal tRajecTory predICtion}$ $\textbf{(CRiTIC)}$, a novel model that utilizes a $\textit{Causal Discovery Network}$ to identify inter-agent causal relations over a window of past time steps. To incorporate discovered causal relationships, we propose a novel $\textit{Causal Attention Gating}$ mechanism to selectively filter information in the proposed Transformer-based architecture. We conduct extensive experiments on two autonomous driving benchmark datasets to evaluate the robustness of our model against non-causal perturbations and its generalization capacity. Our results indicate that the robustness of predictions can be improved by up to $\textbf{54%}$ without a significant detriment to prediction accuracy. Lastly, we demonstrate the superior domain generalizability of the proposed model, which achieves up to $\textbf{29%}$ improvement in cross-domain performance. These results underscore the potential of our model to enhance both robustness and generalization capacity for trajectory prediction in diverse autonomous driving domains.

| **[Quantifying and Modeling Driving Styles in Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04994v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory forecasting has become a popular deep learning task due to its relevance for scenario simulation for autonomous driving. Specifically, trajectory forecasting predicts the trajectory of a short-horizon future for specific human drivers in a particular traffic scenario. Robust and accurate future predictions can enable autonomous driving planners to optimize for low-risk and predictable outcomes for human drivers around them. Although some work has been done to model driving style in planning and personalized autonomous polices, a gap exists in explicitly modeling human driving styles for trajectory forecasting of human behavior. Human driving style is most certainly a correlating factor to decision making, especially in edge-case scenarios where risk is nontrivial, as justified by the large amount of traffic psychology literature on risky driving. So far, the current real-world datasets for trajectory forecasting lack insight on the variety of represented driving styles. While the datasets may represent real-world distributions of driving styles, we posit that fringe driving style types may also be correlated with edge-case safety scenarios. In this work, we conduct analyses on existing real-world trajectory datasets for driving and dissect these works from the lens of driving styles, which is often intangible and non-standardized.</p></details> |  |
| **[INTENT: Trajectory Prediction Framework with Intention-Guided Contrastive Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04952v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction of road agents (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles) is an essential prerequisite for various intelligent systems applications, such as autonomous driving and robotic navigation. Recent research highlights the importance of environmental contexts (e.g., maps) and the "multi-modality" of trajectories, leading to increasingly complex model structures. However, real-world deployments require lightweight models that can quickly migrate and adapt to new environments. Additionally, the core motivations of road agents, referred to as their intentions, deserves further exploration. In this study, we advocate that understanding and reasoning road agents' intention plays a key role in trajectory prediction tasks, and the main challenge is that the concept of intention is fuzzy and abstract. To this end, we present INTENT, an efficient intention-guided trajectory prediction model that relies solely on information contained in the road agent's trajectory. Our model distinguishes itself from existing models in several key aspects: (i) We explicitly model road agents' intentions through contrastive clustering, accommodating the fuzziness and abstraction of human intention in their trajectories. (ii) The proposed INTENT is based solely on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), resulting in reduced training and inference time, making it very efficient and more suitable for real-world deployment. (iii) By leveraging estimated intentions and an innovative algorithm for transforming trajectory observations, we obtain more robust trajectory representations that lead to superior prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world trajectory datasets for pedestrians and autonomous vehicles demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of INTENT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Algorithmic Considerations for Effective Global Search of Robust Low-Thrust Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00297v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing interest in the cislunar domain over the past decade has led to an increasing demand for low-thrust missions to key orbits within this region. These low-thrust missions, typically characterized by long thrust arcs, are highly susceptible to operational disruptions such as unforeseen thruster outages or missed thrust events. Consequently, there is a critical need for efficient trajectory design frameworks which incorporate robustness against such anomalies. In this study, we utilize a robust trajectory design framework to explore the solution space for the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) module to the Earth-Moon L2 Southern 9:2 Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit. We propose algorithmic enhancements to improve the global search for robust solutions, and present a comprehensive analysis of two approaches: a nonconditional approach which involves a purely random search for robust solutions versus a conditional approach which involves warm-starting the search for robust solutions using the non-robust solutions. Our results indicate that by using non-robust solutions as initial guesses for the robust solutions, it is possible to achieve significant improvements in both the rate of convergence and the robustness of the final solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>An up...</summary><p>An update to the paper is available on arxiv as "Sinha, A., Beeson, R.

| **[A Data-Driven Aggressive Autonomous Racing Framework Utilizing Local Trajectory Planning with Velocity Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11570v3)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of autonomous driving has boosted the research on autonomous racing. However, existing local trajectory planning methods have difficulty planning trajectories with optimal velocity profiles at racetracks with sharp corners, thus weakening the performance of autonomous racing. To address this problem, we propose a local trajectory planning method that integrates Velocity Prediction based on Model Predictive Contouring Control (VPMPCC). The optimal parameters of VPMPCC are learned through Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on a proposed novel Objective Function adapted to Racing (OFR). Specifically, VPMPCC achieves velocity prediction by encoding the racetrack as a reference velocity profile and incorporating it into the optimization problem. This method optimizes the velocity profile of local trajectories, especially at corners with significant curvature. The proposed OFR balances racing performance with vehicle safety, ensuring safe and efficient BO training. In the simulation, the number of training iterations for OFR-based BO is reduced by 42.86% compared to the state-of-the-art method. The optimal simulation-trained parameters are then applied to a real-world F1TENTH vehicle without retraining. During prolonged racing on a custom-built racetrack featuring significant sharp corners, the mean projected velocity of VPMPCC reaches 93.18% of the vehicle's handling limits. The released code is available at https://github.com/zhouhengli/VPMPCC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pitch Plane Trajectory Tracking Control for Sounding Rockets via Adaptive Feedback Linearization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05285v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a pitch plane trajectory tacking control solution for suborbital launch vehicles relying on adaptive feedback linearization. Initially, the 2D dynamics and kinematics for a single-engine, thrust-vector-controlled sounding rocket are obtained for control design purposes. Then, an inner-outer control strategy, which simultaneously tackles attitude and position control, is adopted, with the inner-loop comprising the altitude and pitch control and the outer-loop addressing the horizontal (downrange) position control. Feedback linearization is used to cancel out the non-linearities in both the inner and outer dynamics. Making use of Lyapunov stability theory, an adaptation law, which provides online estimates on the inner-loop aerodynamic uncertainty, is jointly designed with the output tracking controller via adaptive backstepping, ensuring global reference tracking in the region where the feedback linearization is well-defined. The zero dynamics of the inner-stabilized system are then exploited to obtain the outerloop dynamics and derive a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with integral action, which can stabilize them as well as reject external disturbances. In the outermost loop, the estimate on the correspondent aerodynamic uncertainty is indirectly obtained by using the inner loop estimates together with known aerodynamics relations. The resulting inner-outer position control solution is proven to be asymptotically stable in the region of interest. Using a single-stage sounding rocket, propelled by a liquid engine, as reference vehicle, different mission scenarios are tested in a simulation environment to verify the adaptability of the proposed control strategy. The system is able to track the requested trajectories while rejecting external wind disturbances. Furthermore, the need to re-tune the control gains in between different mission scenarios is minimal to none.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper presented at the IEEE Aerospace Conference 2025.

| **[Simulation-based Analysis Of Highway Trajectory Planning Using High-Order Polynomial For Highly Automated Driving Function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04159v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the fundamental tasks of autonomous driving is safe trajectory planning, the task of deciding where the vehicle needs to drive, while avoiding obstacles, obeying safety rules, and respecting the fundamental limits of road. Real-world application of such a method involves consideration of surrounding environment conditions and movements such as Lane Change, collision avoidance, and lane merge. The focus of the paper is to develop and implement safe collision free highway Lane Change trajectory using high order polynomial for Highly Automated Driving Function (HADF). Planning is often considered as a higher-level process than control. Behavior Planning Module (BPM) is designed that plans the high-level driving actions like Lane Change maneuver to safely achieve the functionality of transverse guidance ensuring safety of the vehicle using motion planning in a scenario including environmental situation. Based on the recommendation received from the (BPM), the function will generate a desire corresponding trajectory. The proposed planning system is situation specific with polynomial based algorithm for same direction two lane highway scenario. To support the trajectory system polynomial curve can be used to reduces overall complexity and thereby allows rapid computation. The proposed Lane Change scenario is modeled, and results has been analyzed (verified and validate) through the MATLAB simulation environment. The method proposed in this paper has achieved a significant improvement in safety and stability of Lane Changing maneuver.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Pixels to Trajectory: Universal Adversarial Example Detection via Temporal Imprints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04853v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For the first time, we unveil discernible temporal (or historical) trajectory imprints resulting from adversarial example (AE) attacks. Standing in contrast to existing studies all focusing on spatial (or static) imprints within the targeted underlying victim models, we present a fresh temporal paradigm for understanding these attacks. Of paramount discovery is that these imprints are encapsulated within a single loss metric, spanning universally across diverse tasks such as classification and regression, and modalities including image, text, and audio. Recognizing the distinct nature of loss between adversarial and clean examples, we exploit this temporal imprint for AE detection by proposing TRAIT (TRaceable Adversarial temporal trajectory ImprinTs). TRAIT operates under minimal assumptions without prior knowledge of attacks, thereby framing the detection challenge as a one-class classification problem. However, detecting AEs is still challenged by significant overlaps between the constructed synthetic losses of adversarial and clean examples due to the absence of ground truth for incoming inputs. TRAIT addresses this challenge by converting the synthetic loss into a spectrum signature, using the technique of Fast Fourier Transform to highlight the discrepancies, drawing inspiration from the temporal nature of the imprints, analogous to time-series signals. Across 12 AE attacks including SMACK (USENIX Sec'2023), TRAIT demonstrates consistent outstanding performance across comprehensively evaluated modalities, tasks, datasets, and model architectures. In all scenarios, TRAIT achieves an AE detection accuracy exceeding 97%, often around 99%, while maintaining a false rejection rate of 1%. TRAIT remains effective under the formulated strong adaptive attacks.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we focus on the policy learning path in deep RL, represented by the trajectory of network weights of historical policies, which reflects the evolvement of the policy learning process. Taking the idea of trajectory modeling with Transformer, we propose Transformer as Implicit Policy Learner (TIPL), which processes policy network weights in an autoregressive manner. We collect the policy learning path data by running independent RL training trials, with which we then train our TIPL model.

However, collecting such sensitive data raises considerable privacy concerns. Local differential privacy (LDP) offers a solution by allowing individuals to locally perturb their trajectory data before sharing it. Despite its privacy benefits, LDP protocols are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where attackers inject fake data to manipulate aggregated results. In this work, we make the first attempt to analyze vulnerabilities in several representative LDP trajectory protocols. We propose \textsc{TraP}, a heuristic algorithm for data \underline{P}oisoning attacks using a prefix-suffix method to optimize fake \underline{Tra}jectory selection, significantly reducing computational complexity. Our experimental results demonstrate that our attack can substantially increase target pattern occurrences in the perturbed trajectory dataset with few fake users. This study underscores the urgent need for robust defenses and better protocol designs to safeguard LDP trajectory data against malicious manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[TR-LLM: Integrating Trajectory Data for Scene-Aware LLM-Based Human Action Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03993v3)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of human behavior is crucial for AI systems to effectively support real-world applications, such as autonomous robots anticipating and assisting with human tasks. Real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as occlusions and incomplete scene observations, which can compromise predictive accuracy. Thus, traditional video-based methods often struggle due to limited temporal and spatial perspectives. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative. Having been trained on a large text corpus describing human behaviors, LLMs likely encode plausible sequences of human actions in a home environment. However, LLMs, trained primarily on text data, lack inherent spatial awareness and real-time environmental perception. They struggle with understanding physical constraints and spatial geometry. Therefore, to be effective in a real-world spatial scenario, we propose a multimodal prediction framework that enhances LLM-based action prediction by integrating physical constraints derived from human trajectories. Our experiments demonstrate that combining LLM predictions with trajectory data significantly improves overall prediction performance. This enhancement is particularly notable in situations where the LLM receives limited scene information, highlighting the complementary nature of linguistic knowledge and physical constraints in understanding and anticipating human behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reusing Historical Trajectories in Natural Policy Gradient via Importance Sampling: Convergence and Convergence Rate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00675v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning provides a mathematical framework for learning-based control, whose success largely depends on the amount of data it can utilize. The efficient utilization of historical trajectories obtained from previous policies is essential for expediting policy optimization. Empirical evidence has shown that policy gradient methods based on importance sampling work well. However, existing literature often neglect the interdependence between trajectories from different iterations, and the good empirical performance lacks a rigorous theoretical justification. In this paper, we study a variant of the natural policy gradient method with reusing historical trajectories via importance sampling. We show that the bias of the proposed estimator of the gradient is asymptotically negligible, the resultant algorithm is convergent, and reusing past trajectories helps improve the convergence rate. We further apply the proposed estimator to popular policy optimization algorithms such as trust region policy optimization. Our theoretical results are verified on classical benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method uses a Dynamic Buffered Voronoi Cell (DBVC) and a Dynamic Inter-Visibility Cell (DIVC) to formulate the distributed trajectory generation. Specifically, the DBVC and the DIVC are time-variant spaces that prevent mutual collisions and occlusions among agents, while enabling them to maintain suitable distances from the moving target. We combine the DBVC and the DIVC with an efficient Bernstein polynomial motion primitive-based tracking generation method, which has been refined into a less conservative approach than in our previous work. The proposed algorithm can compute each agent's trajectory within several milliseconds on an Intel i7 desktop. We validate the tracking performance in challenging scenarios, including environments with dozens of obstacles.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Unified Human Localization and Trajectory Prediction with Monocular Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03535v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional human trajectory prediction models rely on clean curated data, requiring specialized equipment or manual labeling, which is often impractical for robotic applications. The existing predictors tend to overfit to clean observation affecting their robustness when used with noisy inputs. In this work, we propose MonoTransmotion (MT), a Transformer-based framework that uses only a monocular camera to jointly solve localization and prediction tasks. Our framework has two main modules: Bird's Eye View (BEV) localization and trajectory prediction. The BEV localization module estimates the position of a person using 2D human poses, enhanced by a novel directional loss for smoother sequential localizations. The trajectory prediction module predicts future motion from these estimates. We show that by jointly training both tasks with our unified framework, our method is more robust in real-world scenarios made of noisy inputs. We validate our MT network on both curated and non-curated datasets. On the curated dataset, MT achieves around 12% improvement over baseline models on BEV localization and trajectory prediction. On real-world non-curated dataset, experimental results indicate that MT maintains similar performance levels, highlighting its robustness and generalization capability. The code is available at https://github.com/vita-epfl/MonoTransmotion.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |
| **[Coordinated Trajectories for Non-stop Flying Carriers Holding a Cable-Suspended Load](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03481v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multirotor UAVs have been typically considered for aerial manipulation, but their scarce endurance prevents long-lasting manipulation tasks. This work demonstrates that the non-stop flights of three or more carriers are compatible with holding a constant pose of a cable-suspended load, thus potentially enabling aerial manipulation with energy-efficient non-stop carriers. It also presents an algorithm for generating the coordinated non-stop trajectories. The proposed method builds upon two pillars: (1)~the choice of $n$ special linearly independent directions of internal forces within the $3n-6$-dimensional nullspace of the grasp matrix of the load, chosen as the edges of a Hamiltonian cycle on the graph that connects the cable attachment points on the load. Adjacent pairs of directions are used to generate $n$ forces evolving on distinct 2D affine subspaces, despite the attachment points being generically in 3D; (2)~the construction of elliptical trajectories within these subspaces by mapping, through appropriate graph coloring, each edge of the Hamiltonian cycle to a periodic coordinate while ensuring that no adjacent coordinates exhibit simultaneous zero derivatives. Combined with conditions for load statics and attachment point positions, these choices ensure that each of the $n$ force trajectories projects onto the corresponding cable constraint sphere with non-zero tangential velocity, enabling perpetual motion of the carriers while the load is still. The theoretical findings are validated through simulations and laboratory experiments with non-stopping multirotor UAVs.</p></details> |  |

| **[Graph-Guided Textual Explanation Generation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12318v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language explanations (NLEs) are commonly used to provide plausible free-text explanations of a model's reasoning about its predictions. However, recent work has questioned their faithfulness, as they may not accurately reflect the model's internal reasoning process regarding its predicted answer. In contrast, highlight explanations--input fragments critical for the model's predicted answers--exhibit measurable faithfulness. Building on this foundation, we propose G-Tex, a Graph-Guided Textual Explanation Generation framework designed to enhance the faithfulness of NLEs. Specifically, highlight explanations are first extracted as faithful cues reflecting the model's reasoning logic toward answer prediction. They are subsequently encoded through a graph neural network layer to guide the NLE generation, which aligns the generated explanations with the model's underlying reasoning toward the predicted answer. Experiments on T5 and BART using three reasoning datasets show that G-Tex improves NLE faithfulness by up to 12.18% compared to baseline methods. Additionally, G-Tex generates NLEs with greater semantic and lexical similarity to human-written ones. Human evaluations show that G-Tex can decrease redundant content and enhance the overall quality of NLEs. Our work presents a novel method for explicitly guiding NLE generation to enhance faithfulness, serving as a foundation for addressing broader criteria in NLE and generated text.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessment of Spatio-Temporal Predictors in the Presence of Missing and Heterogeneous Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01701v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning approaches achieve outstanding predictive performance in modeling modern data, despite the increasing complexity and scale. However, evaluating the quality of predictive models becomes more challenging, as traditional statistical assumptions often no longer hold. In particular, spatio-temporal data exhibit dependencies across both time and space, often involving nonlinear dynamics, non-stationarities, and missing observations. As a result, advanced predictors such as spatio-temporal graph neural networks require novel evaluation methodologies. This paper introduces a residual correlation analysis framework designed to assess the optimality of spatio-temporal predictive neural models, particularly in scenarios with incomplete and heterogeneous data. By leveraging the principle that residual correlation indicates information not captured by the model, this framework serves as a powerful tool to identify and localize regions in space and time where model performance can be improved. A key advantage of the proposed approach is its ability to operate under minimal assumptions, enabling robust evaluation of deep learning models applied to multivariate time series, even in the presence of missing and heterogeneous data. The methodology employs tailored spatio-temporal graphs to encode sparse spatial and temporal dependencies within the data and utilizes asymptotically distribution-free summary statistics to pinpoint time intervals and spatial regions where the model underperforms. The effectiveness of the proposed residual analysis is demonstrated through validation on both synthetic and real-world scenarios involving state-of-the-art predictive models.</p></details> |  |

This paper advances the field of travel demand modelling by introducing advanced Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures as surrogate models, addressing key limitations of previous approaches. Building on prior work with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), we introduce GATv3, a new Graph Attention Network (GAT) variant that mitigates over-smoothing through residual connections, enabling deeper and more expressive architectures. Additionally, we propose a fine-grained classification framework that improves predictive stability while achieving numerical precision comparable to regression, offering a more interpretable and efficient alternative. To enhance model performance, we develop a synthetic data generation strategy, which expands the augmented training dataset without overfitting. Our experiments demonstrate that GATv3 significantly improves classification performance, while the GCN model shows unexpected dominance in fine-grained classification when supplemented with additional training data. The results highlight the advantages of fine-grained classification over regression for travel demand modelling tasks and reveal new challenges in extending GAT-based architectures to complex transport scenarios. Notably, GATv3 appears well-suited for classification-based transportation applications, such as section control and congestion warning systems, which require a higher degree of differentiation among neighboring links. These findings contribute to refining GNN-based surrogates, offering new possibilities for applying GATv3 and fine-grained classification in broader transportation challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theoretical Insights into Line Graph Transformation on Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16138v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Line graph transformation has been widely studied in graph theory, where each node in a line graph corresponds to an edge in the original graph. This has inspired a series of graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to transformed line graphs, which have proven effective in various graph representation learning tasks. However, there is limited theoretical study on how line graph transformation affects the expressivity of GNN models. In this study, we focus on two types of graphs known to be challenging to the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) tests: Cai-F\"urer-Immerman (CFI) graphs and strongly regular graphs, and show that applying line graph transformation helps exclude these challenging graph properties, thus potentially assist WL tests in distinguishing these graphs. We empirically validate our findings by conducting a series of experiments that compare the accuracy and efficiency of graph isomorphism tests and GNNs on both line-transformed and original graphs across these graph structure types.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, code available at https://github.com/lukeyf/graphs-and-lines</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Local Selection: Global Cut Selection for Enhanced Mixed-Integer Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15847v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In mixed-integer programming (MIP) solvers, cutting planes are essential for Branch-and-Cut (B&C) algorithms as they reduce the search space and accelerate the solving process. Traditional methods rely on hard-coded heuristics for cut plane selection but fail to leverage problem-specific structural features. Recent machine learning approaches use neural networks for cut selection but focus narrowly on the efficiency of single-node within the B&C algorithm, without considering the broader contextual information. To address this, we propose Global Cut Selection (GCS), which uses a bipartite graph to represent the search tree and combines graph neural networks with reinforcement learning to develop cut selection strategies. Unlike prior methods, GCS applies cutting planes across all nodes, incorporating richer contextual information. Experiments show GCS significantly improves solving efficiency for synthetic and large-scale real-world MIPs compared to traditional and learning-based methods.</p></details> |  |

However, most current graph neural network models face the challenge of requiring extensive labeled data, which limits their practical applicability in real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce. To address this challenge, researchers have explored Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), which leverages enhanced graph data and contrastive learning techniques. While promising, existing GCL methods often struggle with effectively capturing both local and global graph structures, and balancing the trade-off between nodelevel and graph-level representations. In this work, we propose Graph Representation Embedding Enhanced via Multidimensional Contrastive Learning (GRE2-MDCL). Our model introduces a novel triple network architecture with a multi-head attention GNN as the core. GRE2-MDCL first globally and locally augments the input graph using SVD and LAGNN techniques. It then constructs a multidimensional contrastive loss, incorporating cross-network, cross-view, and neighbor contrast, to optimize the model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed demonstrate that GRE2-MDCL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average accuracies of 82.5%, 72.5%, and 81.6% respectively. Visualizations further show tighter intra-cluster aggregation and clearer inter-cluster boundaries, highlighting the effectiveness of our framework in improving upon baseline GCL models.</p></details> | <details><summary>I am ...</summary><p>I am requesting the withdrawal of my paper due to errors identified in the methodology and experimental results.

Our approach uniquely combines graph-structured scene representation with semantic understanding to determine contextually appropriate object positions. The framework employs GPT-2 to transform categorical node and edge labels into rich semantic embeddings that capture both definitional characteristics and typical spatial contexts, enabling nuanced understanding of object relationships and placement patterns. GraPLUS achieves placement accuracy of 92.1% and an FID score of 28.83 on the OPA dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 8.1% while maintaining competitive visual quality. In human evaluation studies involving 964 samples assessed by 19 participants, our method was preferred in 52.1% of cases, significantly outperforming previous approaches. The framework's key innovations include: (i) leveraging pre-trained scene graph models that transfer knowledge from other domains, (ii) edge-aware graph neural networks that process scene semantics through structured relationships, (iii) a cross-modal attention mechanism that aligns categorical embeddings with enhanced scene features, and (iv) a multiobjective training strategy incorporating semantic consistency constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for the Offline Nanosatellite Task Scheduling Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13773v3)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates how to schedule nanosatellite tasks more efficiently using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In the Offline Nanosatellite Task Scheduling (ONTS) problem, the goal is to find the optimal schedule for tasks to be carried out in orbit while taking into account Quality-of-Service (QoS) considerations such as priority, minimum and maximum activation events, execution time-frames, periods, and execution windows, as well as constraints on the satellite's power resources and the complexity of energy harvesting and management. The ONTS problem has been approached using conventional mathematical formulations and exact methods, but their applicability to challenging cases of the problem is limited. This study examines the use of GNNs in this context, which has been effectively applied to optimization problems such as the traveling salesman, scheduling, and facility placement problems. More specifically, we investigate whether GNNs can learn the complex structure of the ONTS problem with respect to feasibility and optimality of candidate solutions. Furthermore, we evaluate using GNN-based heuristic solutions to provide better solutions (w.r.t. the objective value) to the ONTS problem and reduce the optimization cost. Our experiments show that GNNs are not only able to learn feasibility and optimality for instances of the ONTS problem, but they can generalize to harder instances than those seen during training. Furthermore, the GNN-based heuristics improved the expected objective value of the best solution found under the time limit in 45%, and reduced the expected time to find a feasible solution in 35%, when compared to the SCIP (Solving Constraint Integer Programs) solver in its off-the-shelf configuration</p></details> |  |
| **[MERGE: Multi-faceted Hierarchical Graph-based GNN for Gene Expression Prediction from Whole Slide Histopathology Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02601v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) pair histology images with spatially resolved gene expression profiles, enabling predictions of gene expression across different tissue locations based on image patches. This opens up new possibilities for enhancing whole slide image (WSI) prediction tasks with localized gene expression. However, existing methods fail to fully leverage the interactions between different tissue locations, which are crucial for accurate joint prediction. To address this, we introduce MERGE (Multi-faceted hiErarchical gRaph for Gene Expressions), which combines a multi-faceted hierarchical graph construction strategy with graph neural networks (GNN) to improve gene expression predictions from WSIs. By clustering tissue image patches based on both spatial and morphological features, and incorporating intra- and inter-cluster edges, our approach fosters interactions between distant tissue locations during GNN learning. As an additional contribution, we evaluate different data smoothing techniques that are necessary to mitigate artifacts in ST data, often caused by technical imperfections. We advocate for adopting gene-aware smoothing methods that are more biologically justified. Experimental results on gene expression prediction show that our GNN method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques across multiple metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main Paper: 8 pages, Supplementary Material: 11 pages, Figures: 19</p></details> |

While a large set of works explored the expressivity of MPNNs, i.e., their ability to separate graphs and approximate functions over them, comparatively less attention has been directed toward investigating their generalization abilities, i.e., making meaningful predictions beyond the training data. Here, we systematically review the existing literature on the generalization abilities of MPNNs. We analyze the strengths and limitations of various studies in these domains, providing insights into their methodologies and findings. Furthermore, we identify potential avenues for future research, aiming to deepen our understanding of the generalization abilities of MPNNs.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world environments often exhibit inherent asymmetries arising from factors such as external forces, measurement inaccuracies, or intrinsic system biases. This paper introduces \textit{Partially Equivariant Graph NeUral Networks (PEnGUiN)}, a novel architecture specifically designed to address these challenges. We formally identify and categorize various types of partial equivariance relevant to MARL, including subgroup equivariance, feature-wise equivariance, regional equivariance, and approximate equivariance. We theoretically demonstrate that PEnGUiN is capable of learning both fully equivariant (EGNN) and non-equivariant (GNN) representations within a unified framework. Through extensive experiments on a range of MARL problems incorporating various asymmetries, we empirically validate the efficacy of PEnGUiN. Our results consistently demonstrate that PEnGUiN outperforms both EGNNs and standard GNNs in asymmetric environments, highlighting their potential to improve the robustness and applicability of graph-based MARL algorithms in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The inclusion of distributed message-passing in the GNN architecture makes them ideally suited for distributed control and coordination tasks. Existing results develop GNN-based controllers to address a variety of multi-agent control problems while compensating for modeling uncertainties in the systems. However, these results use GNNs that are pre-trained offline. This paper provides the first result on GNNs with stability-driven online weight updates to address the multi-agent target tracking problem. Specifically, new Lyapunov-based distributed GNN and graph attention network (GAT)-based controllers are developed to adaptively estimate unknown target dynamics and address the second-order target tracking problem. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is provided to guarantee exponential convergence of the target state estimates and agent states to a neighborhood of the target state. Numerical simulations show a 20.8% and 48.1% position tracking error performance improvement by the GNN and GAT architectures over a baseline DNN architecture, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, 1 algorithm</p></details> |
| **[Learning to quantify graph nodes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15267v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network Quantification is the problem of estimating the class proportions in unlabeled subsets of graph nodes. When prior probability shift is at play, this task cannot be effectively addressed by first classifying the nodes and then counting the class predictions. In addition, unlike non-relational quantification on i.i.d. datapoints, Network Quantification demands enhanced flexibility to capture a broad range of connectivity patterns, resilience to the challenge of heterophily, and efficiency to scale to larger networks. To meet these stringent requirements we introduce XNQ, a novel method that synergizes the flexibility and efficiency of the unsupervised node embeddings computed by randomized recursive Graph Neural Networks, with an Expectation-Maximization algorithm that provides a robust quantification-aware adjustment to the output probabilities of a calibrated node classifier. We validate the design choices underpinning our method through comprehensive ablation experiments. In an extensive evaluation, we find that our approach consistently and significantly improves on the best Network Quantification methods to date, thereby setting the new state of the art for this challenging task. Simultaneously, it provides a training speed-up of up to 10x-100x over other graph learning based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Topology Actions for Power Grid Control: A Graph-Based Soft-Label Imitation Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15190v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rising proportion of renewable energy in the electricity mix introduces significant operational challenges for power grid operators. Effective power grid management demands adaptive decision-making strategies capable of handling dynamic conditions. With the increase in complexity, more and more Deep Learning (DL) approaches have been proposed to find suitable grid topologies for congestion management. In this work, we contribute to this research by introducing a novel Imitation Learning (IL) approach that leverages soft labels derived from simulated topological action outcomes, thereby capturing multiple viable actions per state. Unlike traditional IL methods that rely on hard labels to enforce a single optimal action, our method constructs soft labels over actions, by leveraging effective actions that prove suitable in resolving grid congestion. To further enhance decision-making, we integrate Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to encode the structural properties of power grids, ensuring that the topology-aware representations contribute to better agent performance. Our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, all of which use only topological actions, as well as feedforward and GNN-based architectures with hard labels. Most notably, it achieves a 17% better performance compared to the greedy expert agent from which the imitation targets were derived.</p></details> |  |

Global change drivers,including climate change or land use modifications, can alter the plant-pollinator interactions. To assert the potential influence of global change drivers on pollination, large-scale interactions, climate and land use data are required. While recent machine learning methods, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), allow the analysis of such datasets, interpreting their results can be challenging. We explore existing methods for interpreting GNNs in order to highlight the effects of various environmental covariates on pollination network connectivity. A large simulation study is performed to confirm whether these methods can detect the interactive effect between a covariate and a genus of plant on connectivity, and whether the application of debiasing techniques influences the estimation of these effects. An application on the Spipoll dataset, with and without accounting for sampling effects, highlights the potential impact of land use on network connectivity and shows that accounting for sampling effects partially alters the estimation of these effects.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by insights from the Topological Data Analysis (TDA) paradigm, of which real-world data exhibits multi-scale patterns, we construct several graphs using Persistent Homology Filtration -- a mathematical framework describing the multiscale structural properties of data points. Then, we use the constructed graphs as an input to create an ensemble of Graph Neural Networks. The ensemble aggregates the signals from the individual learners via an attention-based routing mechanism, thus systematically encoding the inherent multiscale structures of data. Four different real-world experiments on seismic activity prediction and traffic forecasting (PEMS-BAY, METR-LA) demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms single-graph baselines while providing interpretable insights.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we study the enhancement of traffic forecasting with pre-training, focusing on spatio-temporal graph methods. While various machine learning methods to solve traffic forecasting problems have been explored and extensively studied, there is a gap of a more contextual approach: studying how relevant non-traffic data can improve prediction performance on traffic forecasting problems. We call this data spatial context. We introduce a novel method of combining road and traffic information through the notion of a traffic quotient graph, a quotient graph formed from road geometry and traffic sensors. We also define a way to encode this relationship in the form of a geometric encoder, pre-trained using contrastive learning methods and enhanced with OpenStreetMap data. We introduce and discuss ways to integrate this geometric encoder with existing graph neural network (GNN)-based traffic forecasting models, using a contrastive pre-training paradigm. We demonstrate the potential for this hybrid model to improve generalisation and performance with zero additional traffic data.

Indoor scenes mainly consist of man-made objects, such as furniture, which often exhibit rectilinear geometry. This property allows indoor scenes to be represented using combinations of polycuboids, providing a compact representation that benefits downstream applications like furniture rearrangement. Our framework takes a noisy point cloud as input and first detects six types of cuboid faces using a transformer network. Then, a graph neural network is used to validate the spatial relationships of the detected faces to form potential polycuboids. Finally, each polycuboid instance is reconstructed by forming a set of boxes based on the aggregated face labels. To train our networks, we introduce a synthetic dataset encompassing a diverse range of cuboid and polycuboid shapes that reflect the characteristics of indoor scenes. Our framework generalizes well to real-world indoor scene datasets, including Replica, ScanNet, and scenes captured with an iPhone. The versatility of our method is demonstrated through practical applications, such as virtual room tours and scene editing.</p></details> | Accepted to 3DV 2025 |
| **[High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18263v6)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-rank tensors. After decades of research, Bonvicini (2024) recently achieves an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ with factorial time/space complexity. In this work we, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contractions with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set (Pearce-Crump, 2023), through this path matrices technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first analytic, rather than numerical, method for theoretically obtaining arbitrary rank orthogonal ICT decomposition matrices and orthogonal equivariant bases. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available at https://github.com/ShihaoShao-GH/ICT-decomposition-and-equivariant-bases, where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s on 28-cores Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU @ 2.00GHz, respectively.</p></details> | 48 pages |

Recent SL prediction methods integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) into graph neural networks (GNNs) and employ attention mechanisms to extract local subgraphs as explanations for target gene pairs. However, attention mechanisms often lack fidelity, typically generate a single explanation per gene pair, and fail to ensure trustworthy high-order structures in their explanations. To overcome these limitations, we propose Diverse Graph Information Bottleneck for Synthetic Lethality (DGIB4SL), a KG-based GNN that generates multiple faithful explanations for the same gene pair and effectively encodes high-order structures. Specifically, we introduce a novel DGIB objective, integrating a Determinant Point Process (DPP) constraint into the standard IB objective, and employ 13 motif-based adjacency matrices to capture high-order structures in gene representations. Experimental results show that DGIB4SL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and provides multiple explanations for SL prediction, revealing diverse biological mechanisms underlying SL inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages.

Despite its groundbreaking innovation, Vision Graph Neural Network encounters key issues including the quadratic computational complexity caused by its K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) graph construction and the limitation of pairwise relations of normal graphs. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel vision architecture, termed Dilated Vision HyperGraph Neural Network (DVHGNN), which is designed to leverage multi-scale hypergraph to efficiently capture high-order correlations among objects. Specifically, the proposed method tailors Clustering and Dilated HyperGraph Construction (DHGC) to adaptively capture multi-scale dependencies among the data samples. Furthermore, a dynamic hypergraph convolution mechanism is proposed to facilitate adaptive feature exchange and fusion at the hypergraph level. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the benchmark image datasets demonstrate that the proposed DVHGNN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art vision backbones. For instance, our DVHGNN-S achieves an impressive top-1 accuracy of 83.1% on ImageNet-1K, surpassing ViG-S by +1.0% and ViHGNN-S by +0.6%.</p></details> |  |

To this end, the existing methods either focused on the lightweight embeddings for both users and items, or involved on-device systems enjoying the compact embeddings to enhance reusability and reduces space complexity. However, they focus solely on the coarse granularity of embedding, while overlook the fine-grained semantic nuances, to adversarially downgrade the efficacy of meta-embeddings in capturing the intricate relationship over both user and item, consequently resulting into the suboptimal recommendations. In this paper, we aim to study how the meta-embedding can efficiently learn varied grained semantics, together with how the fine-grained meta-embedding can strengthen the representation of coarse-grained meta-embedding. To answer these questions, we develop a novel graph neural networks (GNNs) based recommender where each user and item serves as the node, linked directly to coarse-grained virtual nodes and indirectly to fine-grained virtual nodes, ensuring different grained semantic learning, while disclosing: 1) In contrast to coarse-grained semantics, fine-grained semantics are well captured through sparse meta-embeddings, which adaptively 2) balance the embedding uniqueness and memory constraint. Additionally, the initialization method come up upon SparsePCA, along with a soft thresholding activation function to render the sparseness of the meta-embeddings. We propose a weight bridging update strategy that focuses on matching each coarse-grained meta-embedding with several fine-grained meta-embeddings based on the users/items' semantics. Extensive experiments substantiate our method's superiority over existing baselines.

| **[Combat Urban Congestion via Collaboration: Heterogeneous GNN-based MARL for Coordinated Platooning and Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10948v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the years, reinforcement learning has emerged as a popular approach to develop signal control and vehicle platooning strategies either independently or in a hierarchical way. However, jointly controlling both in real-time to alleviate traffic congestion presents new challenges, such as the inherent physical and behavioral heterogeneity between signal control and platooning, as well as coordination between them. This paper proposes an innovative solution to tackle these challenges based on heterogeneous graph multi-agent reinforcement learning and traffic theories. Our approach involves: 1) designing platoon and signal control as distinct reinforcement learning agents with their own set of observations, actions, and reward functions to optimize traffic flow; 2) designing coordination by incorporating graph neural networks within multi-agent reinforcement learning to facilitate seamless information exchange among agents on a regional scale; 3) applying alternating optimization for training, allowing agents to update their own policies and adapt to other agents' policies. We evaluate our approach through SUMO simulations, which show convergent results in terms of both travel time and fuel consumption, and superior performance compared to other adaptive signal control methods.</p></details> |  |

As a result, techniques in graph representation learning have been simultaneously explored alongside principal neural information retrieval approaches, such as two-phased retrieval, also known as re-ranking. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been proposed to demonstrate proficiency in graph learning for re-ranking, there are ongoing limitations in modeling and evaluating input graph structures for training and evaluation for passage and document ranking tasks. In this survey, we review emerging GNN-based ranking model architectures along with their corresponding graph representation construction methodologies. We conclude by providing recommendations on future research based on community-wide challenges and opportunities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sustainable Greenhouse Microclimate Modeling: A Comparative Analysis of Recurrent and Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17371v3)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems into greenhouses not only optimizes land use but also enhances sustainable agricultural practices by enabling dual benefits of food production and renewable energy generation. However, accurate prediction of internal environmental conditions is crucial to ensure optimal crop growth while maximizing energy production. This study introduces a novel application of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) to greenhouse microclimate modeling, comparing their performance with traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). While RNNs excel at temporal pattern recognition, they cannot explicitly model the directional relationships between environmental variables. Our STGNN approach addresses this limitation by representing these relationships as directed graphs, enabling the model to capture both environmental dependencies and their directionality. Using high-frequency data collected at 15-minute intervals from a greenhouse in Volos, Greece, we demonstrate that RNNs achieve exceptional accuracy in winter conditions ($R^2 = 0.985$) but show limitations during summer cooling system operation. Though STGNNs currently show lower performance (winter $R^2 = 0.947$), their architecture offers greater potential for integrating additional variables such as PV generation and crop growth indicators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying Text Semantics and Graph Structures for Temporal Text-attributed Graphs with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14411v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) have shown remarkable performance in temporal graph modeling. However, real-world temporal graphs often possess rich textual information, giving rise to temporal text-attributed graphs (TTAGs). Such combination of dynamic text semantics and evolving graph structures introduces heightened complexity. Existing TGNNs embed texts statically and rely heavily on encoding mechanisms that biasedly prioritize structural information, overlooking the temporal evolution of text semantics and the essential interplay between semantics and structures for synergistic reinforcement. To tackle these issues, we present \textbf{{Cross}}, a novel framework that seamlessly extends existing TGNNs for TTAG modeling. The key idea is to employ the advanced large language models (LLMs) to extract the dynamic semantics in text space and then generate expressive representations unifying both semantics and structures. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Semantics Extractor in the {Cross} framework, which empowers the LLM to offer the temporal semantic understanding of node's evolving contexts of textual neighborhoods, facilitating semantic dynamics. Subsequently, we introduce the Semantic-structural Co-encoder, which collaborates with the above Extractor for synthesizing illuminating representations by jointly considering both semantic and structural information while encouraging their mutual reinforcement. Extensive experimental results on four public datasets and one practical industrial dataset demonstrate {Cross}'s significant effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> | Submit to ICML2025 |
| **[A Graph-Enhanced Deep-Reinforcement Learning Framework for the Aircraft Landing Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12617v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Aircraft Landing Problem (ALP) is one of the challenging problems in aircraft transportation and management. The challenge is to schedule the arriving aircraft in a sequence so that the cost and delays are optimized. There are various solution approaches to solving this problem, most of which are based on operations research algorithms and meta-heuristics. Although traditional methods perform better on one or the other factors, there remains a problem of solving real-time rescheduling and computational scalability altogether. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines graph neural networks with actor-critic architectures to address the ALP. This paper introduces three key contributions: A graph-based state representation that efficiently captures temporal and spatial relationships between aircraft, a specialized actor-critic architecture designed to handle multiple competing objectives in landing scheduling, and a runway balance strategy that ensures efficient resource utilization while maintaining safety constraints. The results show that the trained algorithm can be tested on different problem sets and the results are competitive to operation research algorithms. The experimental results on standard benchmark data sets demonstrate a 99.95% reduction in computational time compared to Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) and 38% higher runway throughput over First Come First Serve (FCFS) approaches. Therefore, the proposed solution is competitive to traditional approaches and achieves substantial advancements. Notably, it does not require retraining, making it particularly suitable for industrial deployment. The frameworks capability to generate solutions within 1 second enables real-time rescheduling, addressing critical requirements of air traffic management.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, submitted to ESWA, comments are welcome</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Infant Language Acquisition Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14341v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the words that a child is going to learn next can be useful for boosting language acquisition, and such predictions have been shown to be possible with both neural network techniques (looking at changes in the vocabulary state over time) and graph model (looking at data pertaining to the relationships between words). However, these models do not fully capture the complexity of the language learning process of an infant when used in isolation. In this paper, we examine how a model of language acquisition for infants and young children can be constructed and adapted for use in a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN), taking into account the different types of linguistic relationships that occur during child language learning. We introduce a novel approach for predicting child vocabulary acquisition, and evaluate the efficacy of such a model with respect to the different types of linguistic relationships that occur during language acquisition, resulting in insightful observations on model calibration and norm selection. An evaluation of this model found that the mean accuracy of models for predicting new words when using sensorimotor relationships (0.733) and semantic relationships (0.729) were found to be superior to that observed with a 2-layer Feed-forward neural network. Furthermore, the high recall for some relationships suggested that some relationships (e.g. visual) were superior in identifying a larger proportion of relevant words that a child should subsequently learn than others (such as auditory).</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-Order Graphon Neural Networks: Approximation and Cut Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14338v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph limit models, like graphons for limits of dense graphs, have recently been used to study size transferability of graph neural networks (GNNs). While most literature focuses on message passing GNNs (MPNNs), in this work we attend to the more powerful higher-order GNNs. First, we extend the $k$-WL test for graphons (B\"oker, 2023) to the graphon-signal space and introduce signal-weighted homomorphism densities as a key tool. As an exemplary focus, we generalize Invariant Graph Networks (IGNs) to graphons, proposing Invariant Graphon Networks (IWNs) defined via a subset of the IGN basis corresponding to bounded linear operators. Even with this restricted basis, we show that IWNs of order $k$ are at least as powerful as the $k$-WL test, and we establish universal approximation results for graphon-signals in $L^p$ distances. This significantly extends the prior work of Cai & Wang (2022), showing that IWNs--a subset of their IGN-small--retain effectively the same expressivity as the full IGN basis in the limit. In contrast to their approach, our blueprint of IWNs also aligns better with the geometry of graphon space, for example facilitating comparability to MPNNs. We highlight that, while typical higher-order GNNs are discontinuous w.r.t. cut distance--which causes their lack of convergence and is inherently tied to the definition of $k$-WL--their transferability remains comparable to MPNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 6 figures, ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[VGFL-SA: Vertical Graph Federated Learning Structure Attack Based on Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16793v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained attention for their ability to learn representations from graph data. Due to privacy concerns and conflicts of interest that prevent clients from directly sharing graph data with one another, Vertical Graph Federated Learning (VGFL) frameworks have been developed. Recent studies have shown that VGFL is vulnerable to adversarial attacks that degrade performance. However, it is a common problem that client nodes are often unlabeled in the realm of VGFL. Consequently, the existing attacks, which rely on the availability of labeling information to obtain gradients, are inherently constrained in their applicability. This limitation precludes their deployment in practical, real-world environments. To address the above problems, we propose a novel graph adversarial attack against VGFL, referred to as VGFL-SA, to degrade the performance of VGFL by modifying the local clients structure without using labels. Specifically, VGFL-SA uses a contrastive learning method to complete the attack before the local clients are trained. VGFL-SA first accesses the graph structure and node feature information of the poisoned clients, and generates the contrastive views by node-degree-based edge augmentation and feature shuffling augmentation. Then, VGFL-SA uses the shared graph encoder to get the embedding of each view, and the gradients of the adjacency matrices are obtained by the contrastive function. Finally, perturbed edges are generated using gradient modification rules. We validated the performance of VGFL-SA by performing a node classification task on real-world datasets, and the results show that VGFL-SA achieves good attack effectiveness and transferability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Data Selection for Training Genomic Perturbation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14571v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Genomic studies, including CRISPR-based PerturbSeq analyses, face a vast hypothesis space, while gene perturbations remain costly and time-consuming. Gene expression models based on graph neural networks are trained to predict the outcomes of gene perturbations to facilitate such experiments. Active learning methods are often employed to train these models due to the cost of the genomic experiments required to build the training set. However, poor model initialization in active learning can result in suboptimal early selections, wasting time and valuable resources. While typical active learning mitigates this issue over many iterations, the limited number of experimental cycles in genomic studies exacerbates the risk. To this end, we propose graph-based one-shot data selection methods for training gene expression models. Unlike active learning, one-shot data selection predefines the gene perturbations before training, hence removing the initialization bias. The data selection is motivated by theoretical studies of graph neural network generalization. The criteria are defined over the input graph and are optimized with submodular maximization. We compare them empirically to baselines and active learning methods that are state-of-the-art on this problem. The results demonstrate that graph-based one-shot data selection achieves comparable accuracy while alleviating the aforementioned risks.</p></details> | 19 pages |

These methods typically capture global interests using aggregated past interactions and rely on static embeddings of users and items over extended periods of time. While effective in some domains, these methods fall short in many real-world scenarios, especially in finance, where user interests and item popularity evolve rapidly over time. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel extension to Light Graph Convolutional Network (LightGCN) designed to learn temporal node embeddings that capture dynamic interests. Our approach employs causal convolution to maintain a forward-looking model architecture. By preserving the chronological order of user-item interactions and introducing a dynamic update mechanism for embeddings through a sliding window, the proposed model generates well-timed and contextually relevant recommendations. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset from BNP Paribas demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the performance of LightGCN while maintaining the simplicity and efficiency of its architecture. Our findings provide new insights into designing graph-based recommender systems in time-sensitive applications, particularly for financial product recommendations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, published in the international conference for AI in Finance (ACM ICAIF'24)</p></details> |
| **[SMPR: A structure-enhanced multimodal drug-disease prediction model for drug repositioning and cold start](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13322v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Repositioning drug-disease relationships has always been a hot field of research. However, actual cases of biologically validated drug relocation remain very limited, and existing models have not yet fully utilized the structural information of the drug. Furthermore, most repositioning models are only used to complete the relationship matrix, and their practicality is poor when dealing with drug cold start problems. This paper proposes a structure-enhanced multimodal relationship prediction model (SMRP). SMPR is based on the SMILE structure of the drug, using the Mol2VEC method to generate drug embedded representations, and learn disease embedded representations through heterogeneous network graph neural networks. Ultimately, a drug-disease relationship matrix is constructed. In addition, to reduce the difficulty of users' use, SMPR also provides a cold start interface based on structural similarity based on reposition results to simply and quickly predict drug-related diseases. The repositioning ability and cold start capability of the model are verified from multiple perspectives. While the AUC and ACUPR scores of repositioning reach 99% and 61% respectively, the AUC of cold start achieve 80%. In particular, the cold start Recall indicator can reach more than 70%, which means that SMPR is more sensitive to positive samples. Finally, case analysis is used to verify the practical value of the model and visual analysis directly demonstrates the improvement of the structure to the model. For quick use, we also provide local deployment of the model and package it into an executable program.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor Networks Meet Neural Networks: A Survey and Future Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09019v3)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor networks (TNs) and neural networks (NNs) are two fundamental data modeling approaches. TNs were introduced to solve the curse of dimensionality in large-scale tensors by converting an exponential number of dimensions to polynomial complexity. As a result, they have attracted significant attention in the fields of quantum physics and machine learning. Meanwhile, NNs have displayed exceptional performance in various applications, e.g., computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics research. Interestingly, although these two types of networks originate from different observations, they are inherently linked through the typical multilinearity structure underlying both TNs and NNs, thereby motivating a significant number of developments regarding combinations of TNs and NNs. In this paper, we refer to these combinations as tensorial neural networks~(TNNs) and present an introduction to TNNs from both data processing and model architecture perspectives. From the data perspective, we explore the capabilities of TNNs in multi-source fusion, multimodal pooling, data compression, multi-task training, and quantum data processing. From the model perspective, we examine TNNs' integration with various architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Graph Neural Networks, Transformers, Large Language Models, and Quantum Neural Networks. Furthermore, this survey also explores methods for improving TNNs, examines flexible toolboxes for implementing TNNs, and documents TNN development while highlighting potential future directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey that bridges the connections among NNs and TNs. We provide a curated list of TNNs at https://github.com/tnbar/awesome-tensorial-neural-networks.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Finite Element Method (FEM)-based simulations, while accurate, are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time scenarios. Learning-based approaches have shown promise in accelerating predictions but have fallen short in modeling soft-rigid interactions effectively. We introduce MIXPINN, a physics-informed Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for mixed-material simulations, explicitly capturing soft-rigid interactions using graph-based augmentations. Our approach integrates Virtual Nodes (VNs) and Virtual Edges (VEs) to enhance rigid body constraint satisfaction while preserving computational efficiency. By leveraging a graph-based representation of biomechanical structures, MIXPINN learns high-fidelity deformations from FEM-generated data and achieves real-time inference with sub-millimeter accuracy. We validate our method in a realistic clinical scenario, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline GNN models and traditional FEM methods. Our results show that MIXPINN reduces computational cost by an order of magnitude while maintaining high physical accuracy, making it a viable solution for real-time surgical simulation and robotic-assisted procedures.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the lEEE IROS 2025 for possible publication</p></details> |

However, finger motions are highly articulated with multiple degrees of freedom, making them significantly harder to model and predict. To address this challenge, we propose a physics-inspired time-agnostic graph neural network (TA-GNN) to accurately predict human finger motions. The proposed encoder comprises a kinematic feature extractor to generate filtered velocity and acceleration and a physics-based encoder that follows linear kinematics. The model is designed to be prediction-time-agnostic so that it can seamlessly provide continuous predictions. The graph-based decoder for learning the topological motion between finger joints is designed to address the higher degree articulation of fingers. We show the superiority of our model performance in virtual reality context. This novel approach enhances finger tracking without additional sensors, enabling predictive interactions such as haptic re-targeting and improving predictive rendering quality.</p></details> |  |

In explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), the Shapley Value (SV) is the predominant method to quantify contributions of individual features to a ML model's output. Addressing the limitations of SVs in complex prediction models, Shapley Interactions (SIs) extend the SV to groups of features. In this work, we explain single graph predictions of GNNs with SIs that quantify node contributions and interactions among multiple nodes. By exploiting the GNN architecture, we show that the structure of interactions in node embeddings are preserved for graph prediction. As a result, the exponential complexity of SIs depends only on the receptive fields, i.e. the message-passing ranges determined by the connectivity of the graph and the number of convolutional layers. Based on our theoretical results, we introduce GraphSHAP-IQ, an efficient approach to compute any-order SIs exactly. GraphSHAP-IQ is applicable to popular message passing techniques in conjunction with a linear global pooling and output layer. We showcase that GraphSHAP-IQ substantially reduces the exponential complexity of computing exact SIs on multiple benchmark datasets. Beyond exact computation, we evaluate GraphSHAP-IQ's approximation of SIs on popular GNN architectures and compare with existing baselines. Lastly, we visualize SIs of real-world water distribution networks and molecule structures using a SI-Graph.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint Version.

Existing solutions primarily rely on prompt-based LLM methods or fine-tuned lightweight language models for idea evaluation. However, these methods are often unstable and struggle to comprehend the complex semantic information embedded in the ideas, impeding their ability to perform high-quality evaluations. To address the above challenges, we propose GraphEval, a lightweight graph-based LLM framework for idea evaluation. Our insight is that a complex idea can be broken down into comprehensible viewpoint nodes using prompts from small LLMs. These viewpoint nodes can then be linked together through edges created from LLM-based relation extraction and/or BERT similarity scores. The created viewpoint-graph can be used to conveniently propagate scores across view-nodes to improve the robustness of the idea evaluations. In particular, we propose two lightweight graph-based methods for idea evaluation: (1) GraphEval-LP: a training-free label propagation algorithm that propagates evaluation scores from known view-nodes to unknown nodes; (2) GraphEval-GNN: a Graph Neural Networks (GNN) that is trained to predict the evaluation scores given the observed graph with minimal computation resources. Moreover, to overcome LLM's limitation in objectively assessing the novelty of ideas, we further propose a novelty detection model to GraphEval-GNN to enhance its capability in judging idea novelty. Experiments on two datasets show GraphEval improves F1 scores by at least 14% with low computation and API costs. Additionally, GraphEval can effectively detect plagiarized ideas.</p></details> |  |

Although existing methods have shown great performance in generating entire graphs for graph-level learning tasks, no graph diffusion models have been developed to generate synthetic graph structures, that is, synthetic nodes and associated edges within a given graph, for node-level learning tasks. Inspired by the research in the computer vision literature using synthetic data for enhanced performance, we propose Diffusion on Graph (DoG), which generates synthetic graph structures to boost the performance of GNNs. The synthetic graph structures generated by DoG are combined with the original graph to form an augmented graph for the training of node-level learning tasks, such as node classification and graph contrastive learning (GCL). To improve the efficiency of the generation process, a Bi-Level Neighbor Map Decoder (BLND) is introduced in DoG. To mitigate the adverse effect of the noise introduced by the synthetic graph structures, a low-rank regularization method is proposed for the training of graph neural networks (GNNs) on the augmented graphs. Extensive experiments on various graph datasets for semi-supervised node classification and graph contrastive learning have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of DoG with low-rank regularization. The code of DoG is available at https://github.com/Statistical-Deep-Learning/DoG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR) 2025</p></details> |

Graph neural networks combined with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which consist of 14,000 to 500 millions parameters, generate features for visual entities (e.g., scene and object types) and identify the entities that contribute to the decision. In this paper, we show that using a simpler combination of transfer learning and a CNN to relate privacy with scene types optimises only 732 parameters while achieving comparable performance to that of graph-based methods. On the contrary, end-to-end training of graph-based methods can mask the contribution of individual components to the classification performance. Furthermore, we show that a high-dimensional feature vector, extracted with CNNs for each visual entity, is unnecessary and complexifies the model. The graph component has also negligible impact on performance, which is driven by fine-tuning the CNN to optimise image features for privacy nodes.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages (13 for the main article, 8 for bibliography, acks, appendixes), 9 figures, 12 tables.

Despite advances in high-throughput sequencing, accurately identifying TFBS remains challenging due to the vast genomic data and complex binding patterns. GCBLANE, a graph-enhanced convolutional bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) attention network, is introduced to address this issue. It integrates convolutional, multi-head attention, and recurrent layers with a graph neural network to detect key features for TFBS prediction. On 690 ENCODE ChIP-Seq datasets, GCBLANE achieved an average AUC of 0.943, and on 165 ENCODE datasets, it reached an AUC of 0.9495, outperforming advanced models that utilize multimodal approaches, including DNA shape information. This result underscores GCBLANE's effectiveness compared to other methods. By combining graph-based learning with sequence analysis, GCBLANE significantly advances TFBS prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[LMC: Fast Training of GNNs via Subgraph Sampling with Provable Convergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00924v4)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The message passing-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in many real-world applications. However, training GNNs on large-scale graphs suffers from the well-known neighbor explosion problem, i.e., the exponentially increasing dependencies of nodes with the number of message passing layers. Subgraph-wise sampling methods -- a promising class of mini-batch training techniques -- discard messages outside the mini-batches in backward passes to avoid the neighbor explosion problem at the expense of gradient estimation accuracy. This poses significant challenges to their convergence analysis and convergence speeds, which seriously limits their reliable real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose a novel subgraph-wise sampling method with a convergence guarantee, namely Local Message Compensation (LMC). To the best of our knowledge, LMC is the {\it first} subgraph-wise sampling method with provable convergence. The key idea of LMC is to retrieve the discarded messages in backward passes based on a message passing formulation of backward passes. By efficient and effective compensations for the discarded messages in both forward and backward passes, LMC computes accurate mini-batch gradients and thus accelerates convergence. We further show that LMC converges to first-order stationary points of GNNs. Experiments on large-scale benchmark tasks demonstrate that LMC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art subgraph-wise sampling methods in terms of efficiency.</p></details> |  |

To address this, numerous temporal graph neural networks (temporal GNNs) and benchmark datasets have been developed. However, these datasets often feature excessive repeated edges and lack complex sequential dynamics, a key characteristic inherent in many real-world applications such as recommender systems and ``Who-To-Follow'' on social networks. This oversight has led existing methods to inadvertently downplay the importance of learning sequential dynamics, focusing primarily on predicting repeated edges. In this study, we demonstrate that existing methods, such as GraphMixer and DyGFormer, are inherently incapable of learning simple sequential dynamics, such as ``a user who has followed OpenAI and Anthropic is more likely to follow AI at Meta next.'' Motivated by this issue, we introduce the Temporal Graph Benchmark with Sequential Dynamics (TGB-Seq), a new benchmark carefully curated to minimize repeated edges, challenging models to learn sequential dynamics and generalize to unseen edges. TGB-Seq comprises large real-world datasets spanning diverse domains, including e-commerce interactions, movie ratings, business reviews, social networks, citation networks and web link networks. Benchmarking experiments reveal that current methods usually suffer significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs on TGB-Seq, posing new challenges and opportunities for future research.

Recently, Graph Neural Network (GNN) based approach has demonstrated great effectiveness in GAD by first encoding graph data into low-dimensional representations and then identifying anomalies under the guidance of supervised or unsupervised signals. However, existing GNN-based approaches implicitly follow the homophily principle (i.e., the "like attracts like" phenomenon) and fail to learn discriminative embedding for anomalies that connect vast normal nodes. Moreover, such approaches identify anomalies in a unified global perspective but overlook diversified abnormal patterns conditioned on local graph context, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, in this paper, we propose a Multi-hypersphere Heterophilic Graph Learning (MHetGL) framework for unsupervised GAD. Specifically, we first devise a Heterophilic Graph Encoding (HGE) module to learn distinguishable representations for potential anomalies by purifying and augmenting their neighborhood in a fully unsupervised manner. Then, we propose a Multi-Hypersphere Learning (MHL) module to enhance the detection capability for context-dependent anomalies by jointly incorporating critical patterns from both global and local perspectives. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets show that MHetGL outperforms 14 baselines. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/KennyNH/MHetGL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Decomposition of Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19723v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNN) exhibit superior performance in graph representation learning, but their inference cost can be high, due to an aggregation operation that can require a memory fetch for a very large number of nodes. This inference cost is the major obstacle to deploying GNN models with \emph{online prediction} to reflect the potentially dynamic node features. To address this, we propose an approach to reduce the number of nodes that are included during aggregation. We achieve this through a sparse decomposition, learning to approximate node representations using a weighted sum of linearly transformed features of a carefully selected subset of nodes within the extended neighbourhood. The approach achieves linear complexity with respect to the average node degree and the number of layers in the graph neural network. We introduce an algorithm to compute the optimal parameters for the sparse decomposition, ensuring an accurate approximation of the original GNN model, and present effective strategies to reduce the training time and improve the learning process. We demonstrate via extensive experiments that our method outperforms other baselines designed for inference speedup, achieving significant accuracy gains with comparable inference times for both node classification and spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Dynamics Models with Generative State Estimation for Cloth Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11999v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manipulating deformable objects like cloth is challenging due to their complex dynamics, near-infinite degrees of freedom, and frequent self-occlusions, which complicate state estimation and dynamics modeling. Prior work has struggled with robust cloth state estimation, while dynamics models, primarily based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are limited by their locality. Inspired by recent advances in generative models, we hypothesize that these expressive models can effectively capture intricate cloth configurations and deformation patterns from data. Building on this insight, we propose a diffusion-based generative approach for both perception and dynamics modeling. Specifically, we formulate state estimation as reconstructing the full cloth state from sparse RGB-D observations conditioned on a canonical cloth mesh and dynamics modeling as predicting future states given the current state and robot actions. Leveraging a transformer-based diffusion model, our method achieves high-fidelity state reconstruction while reducing long-horizon dynamics prediction errors by an order of magnitude compared to GNN-based approaches. Integrated with model-predictive control (MPC), our framework successfully executes cloth folding on a real robotic system, demonstrating the potential of generative models for manipulation tasks with partial observability and complex dynamics.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore the synergistic combination of graph encoding, graph rewiring, and graph attention, by introducing Graph Attention with Stochastic Structures (GRASS), a novel GNN architecture. GRASS utilizes relative random walk probabilities (RRWP) encoding and a novel decomposed variant (D-RRWP) to efficiently capture structural information. It rewires the input graph by superimposing a random regular graph to enhance long-range information propagation. It also employs a novel additive attention mechanism tailored for graph-structured data. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that GRASS achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, including a 20.3% reduction in mean absolute error on the ZINC dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

We introduce a novel presence-only SDM with graph neural networks (GNN). In our model, species and locations are treated as two distinct node sets, and the learning task is predicting detection records as the edges that connect locations to species. Using GNN for SDM allows us to model fine-grained interactions between species and the environment. We evaluate the potential of this methodology on the six-region dataset compiled by National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) for benchmarking SDMs. For each of the regions, the heterogeneous GNN model is comparable to or outperforms previously-benchmarked single-species SDMs as well as a feed-forward neural network baseline model.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures, |

They disseminate information through interconnected nodes, but long-range interactions face challenges known as "over-squashing". This survey delves into the challenge of over-squashing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where long-range information dissemination is hindered, impacting tasks reliant on intricate long-distance interactions. It comprehensively explores the causes, consequences, and mitigation strategies for over-squashing. Various methodologies are reviewed, including graph rewiring, novel normalization, spectral analysis, and curvature-based strategies, with a focus on their trade-offs and effectiveness. The survey also discusses the interplay between over-squashing and other GNN limitations, such as over-smoothing, and provides a taxonomy of models designed to address these issues in node and graph-level tasks.

| **[Tensor Convolutional Network for Higher-Order Interaction Prediction in Sparse Tensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11786v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world data, such as recommendation data and temporal graphs, can be represented as incomplete sparse tensors where most entries are unobserved. For such sparse tensors, identifying the top-k higher-order interactions that are most likely to occur among unobserved ones is crucial. Tensor factorization (TF) has gained significant attention in various tensor-based applications, serving as an effective method for finding these top-k potential interactions. However, existing TF methods primarily focus on effectively fusing latent vectors of entities, which limits their expressiveness. Since most entities in sparse tensors have only a few interactions, their latent representations are often insufficiently trained. In this paper, we propose TCN, an accurate and compatible tensor convolutional network that integrates seamlessly with existing TF methods for predicting higher-order interactions. We design a highly effective encoder to generate expressive latent vectors of entities. To achieve this, we propose to (1) construct a graph structure derived from a sparse tensor and (2) develop a relation-aware encoder, TCN, that learns latent representations of entities by leveraging the graph structure. Since TCN complements traditional TF methods, we seamlessly integrate TCN with existing TF methods, enhancing the performance of predicting top-k interactions. Extensive experiments show that TCN integrated with a TF method outperforms competitors, including TF methods and a hyperedge prediction method. Moreover, TCN is broadly compatible with various TF methods and GNNs (Graph Neural Networks), making it a versatile solution.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Recent work suggests that "souping" (combining) individually trained GNNs into a single model can improve performance without increasing compute and memory costs during inference. However, existing souping algorithms are often slow and memory-intensive, which limits their scalability. We introduce Learned Souping for GNNs, a gradient-descent-based souping strategy that substantially reduces time and memory overhead compared to existing methods. Our approach is evaluated across multiple Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) datasets and GNN architectures, achieving up to 1.2% accuracy improvement and 2.1X speedup. Additionally, we propose Partition Learned Souping, a novel partition-based variant of learned souping that significantly reduces memory usage. On the ogbn-products dataset with GraphSAGE, partition learned souping achieves a 24.5X speedup and a 76% memory reduction without compromising accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, accepted to GrAPL 2025 (colocated with IPDPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[GNNs as Predictors of Agentic Workflow Performances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11301v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic workflows invoked by Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in handling complex tasks. However, optimizing such workflows is costly and inefficient in real-world applications due to extensive invocations of LLMs. To fill this gap, this position paper formulates agentic workflows as computational graphs and advocates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as efficient predictors of agentic workflow performances, avoiding repeated LLM invocations for evaluation. To empirically ground this position, we construct FLORA-Bench, a unified platform for benchmarking GNNs for predicting agentic workflow performances. With extensive experiments, we arrive at the following conclusion: GNNs are simple yet effective predictors. This conclusion supports new applications of GNNs and a novel direction towards automating agentic workflow optimization.

| **[FastCHGNet: Training one Universal Interatomic Potential to 1.5 Hours with 32 GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20796v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural network universal interatomic potentials (GNN-UIPs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization and transfer capabilities in material discovery and property prediction. These models can accelerate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation by several orders of magnitude while maintaining \textit{ab initio} accuracy, making them a promising new paradigm in material simulations. One notable example is Crystal Hamiltonian Graph Neural Network (CHGNet), pretrained on the energies, forces, stresses, and magnetic moments from the MPtrj dataset, representing a state-of-the-art GNN-UIP model for charge-informed MD simulations. However, training the CHGNet model is time-consuming(8.3 days on one A100 GPU) for three reasons: (i) requiring multi-layer propagation to reach more distant atom information, (ii) requiring second-order derivatives calculation to finish weights updating and (iii) the implementation of reference CHGNet does not fully leverage the computational capabilities. This paper introduces FastCHGNet, an optimized CHGNet, with three contributions: Firstly, we design innovative Force/Stress Readout modules to decompose Force/Stress prediction. Secondly, we adopt massive optimizations such as kernel fusion, redundancy bypass, etc, to exploit GPU computation power sufficiently. Finally, we extend CHGNet to support multiple GPUs and propose a load-balancing technique to enhance GPU utilization. Numerical results show that FastCHGNet reduces memory footprint by a factor of 3.59. The final training time of FastCHGNet can be decreased to \textbf{1.53 hours} on 32 GPUs without sacrificing model accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, many existing architectures struggle with scalability, relying on a fixed structure tied to a specific number of agents, limiting their applicability to environments with a variable number of entities. While approaches such as graph neural networks (GNNs) and self-attention mechanisms have progressed in addressing these challenges, they have significant limitations as dense GNNs and self-attention mechanisms incur high computational costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel agent network and a non-linear mixing network that ensure permutation-equivariance and scalability, allowing them to generalize to environments with various numbers of agents. Our agent network significantly reduces computational complexity, and our scalable hypernetwork enables efficient weight generation for non-linear mixing. Additionally, we introduce curriculum learning to improve training efficiency. Experiments on SMACv2 and Google Research Football (GRF) demonstrate that our approach achieves superior learning performance compared to existing methods. By addressing both permutation-invariance and scalability in MARL, our work provides a more efficient and adaptable framework for cooperative MARL.

| **[Power-Aware Scheduling for Multi-Center HPC Electricity Cost Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11011v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces TARDIS (Temporal Allocation for Resource Distribution using Intelligent Scheduling), a novel power-aware job scheduler for High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems that minimizes electricity costs through both temporal and spatial optimization. Our approach addresses the growing concerns of energy consumption in HPC centers, where electricity expenses constitute a substantial portion of operational costs and have a significant financial impact. TARDIS employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to accurately predict individual job power consumption, then uses these predictions to strategically schedule jobs across multiple HPC facilities based on time-varying electricity prices. The system integrates both temporal scheduling, shifting power-intensive workloads to off-peak hours, and spatial scheduling, distributing jobs across geographically dispersed centers with different pricing schemes. We evaluate TARDIS using trace-based simulations from real HPC workloads, demonstrating cost reductions of up to 18% in temporal optimization scenarios and 10 to 20% in multi-site environments compared to state-of-the-art scheduling approaches, while maintaining comparable system performance and job throughput. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that TARDIS effectively addresses limitations in existing power-aware scheduling approaches by combining accurate power prediction with holistic spatial-temporal optimization, providing a scalable solution for sustainable and cost-efficient HPC operations.</p></details> |  |

Recently, graph prompt learning has emerged as a powerful GNN training paradigm, inspired by advances in language and vision foundation models. Here, a GNN is pre-trained on public data and then adapted to sensitive tasks using lightweight graph prompts. However, using prompts from sensitive data poses privacy risks. In this work, we are the first to investigate these practical risks in graph prompts by instantiating a membership inference attack that reveals significant privacy leakage. We also find that the standard privacy method, DP-SGD, fails to provide practical privacy-utility trade-offs in graph prompt learning, likely due to the small number of sensitive data points used to learn the prompts. As a solution, we propose DP-GPL for differentially private graph prompt learning based on the PATE framework, that generates a graph prompt with differential privacy guarantees. Our evaluation across various graph prompt learning methods, GNN architectures, and pre-training strategies demonstrates that our algorithm achieves high utility at strong privacy, effectively mitigating privacy concerns while preserving the powerful capabilities of prompted GNNs as powerful foundation models in the graph domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Clifford Algebraic Approach to E(n)-Equivariant High-order Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04692v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing neural network architectures that can handle data symmetry is crucial. This is especially important for geometric graphs whose properties are equivariance under Euclidean transformations. Current equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs), particularly those using message passing, have a limitation in expressive power. Recent high-order graph neural networks can overcome this limitation, yet they lack equivariance properties, representing a notable drawback in certain applications in chemistry and physical sciences. In this paper, we introduce the Clifford Group Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (CG-EGNNs), a novel EGNN that enhances high-order message passing by integrating high-order local structures in the context of Clifford algebras. As a key benefit of using Clifford algebras, CG-EGNN can learn functions that capture equivariance from positional features. By adopting the high-order message passing mechanism, CG-EGNN gains richer information from neighbors, thus improving model performance. Furthermore, we establish the universality property of the $k$-hop message passing framework, showcasing greater expressive power of CG-EGNNs with additional $k$-hop message passing mechanism. We empirically validate that CG-EGNNs outperform previous methods on various benchmarks including n-body, CMU motion capture, and MD17, highlighting their effectiveness in geometric deep learning.</p></details> |  |

To design these innovative materials, it is important to be able to simulate them accurately and quickly, in order to tune their mechanical properties. Since conventional simulations using the finite element method entail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine learning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To ensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including those not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of the network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts global quantities (energy, stress stiffness) as well as the pattern transformations that occur (the kinematics). To make our model as accurate and data-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model. The starting point is an E(n)-equivariant graph neural network (which respects translation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions (i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale in-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars, vectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress and stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model equivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean group E(n) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and data-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries. To create an efficient graph representation of the finite element discretization, we use only the internal geometrical hole boundaries from the finite element mesh to achieve a better speed-up and scaling with the mesh size.</p></details> | <details><summary>60 pa...</summary><p>60 pages, 22 figures.

Specifically, we use a graph neural network-based encoder to embed the node features and find the optimal node embeddings by minimizing the worst-case risk through a minimax formulation. Such an uncertainty-aware learning process leads to improved node representations and a more robust graph predictive model that effectively mitigates the impact of uncertainty arising from data noise.

Neural network-based approaches, such as convolutional and graph neural networks, have partially alleviated this burden by enabling efficient local feature extraction. However, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies due to limited receptive fields, and Transformer-based models, while providing global context, incur prohibitive computational costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose AMR-Transformer, an efficient and accurate neural CFD-solving pipeline that integrates a novel adaptive mesh refinement scheme with a Navier-Stokes constraint-aware fast pruning module. This design encourages long-range interactions between simulation cells and facilitates the modeling of global fluid wave patterns, such as turbulence and shockwaves. Experiments show that our approach achieves significant gains in efficiency while preserving critical details, making it suitable for high-resolution physical simulations with long-range dependencies. On CFDBench, PDEBench and a new shockwave dataset, our pipeline demonstrates up to an order-of-magnitude improvement in accuracy over baseline models. Additionally, compared to ViT, our approach achieves a reduction in FLOPs of up to 60 times.</p></details> |  |

Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, primarily based on graph neural networks (GNNs), encounter difficulties in capturing long-term, long-distance, and fine-grained interactions among heterogeneous player nodes, as well as in recognizing interaction patterns. Additionally, they exhibit limited generalization to untrained downstream tasks and zero-shot scenarios. In this work, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Propagation Symmetry-Aware Graph Transformer for fine-grained game modeling. This architecture explicitly captures delay effects in the spatial space to enhance player node representations across discrete-time slices, employing symmetry-invariant priors to guide the attention mechanism. We also introduce an efficient contrastive learning strategy to train a Mixture of Tactics Experts module, facilitating differentiated modeling of offensive tactics. By integrating dense training with sparse inference, we achieve a 2.4x improvement in model efficiency. Moreover, the incorporation of Lightweight Graph Grounding for Large Language Models enables robust performance in open-ended downstream tasks and zero-shot scenarios, including novel teams or players. The proposed model, TacticExpert, delineates a vertically integrated large model framework for basketball, unifying pretraining across multiple datasets and downstream prediction tasks. Fine-grained modeling modules significantly enhance spatial-temporal representations, and visualization analyzes confirm the strong interpretability of the model.</p></details> |  |

This study identifies this limitation and introduces a reachability-based graph transformation to densify topological connections, reducing resistance distances. Empirical tests show transformed-GNNs outperform EA-LSTM in extreme flood prediction, achieving 24-h water level accuracy equivalent to EA-LSTM's 14-h forecasts - a 71% improvement in long-term predictive horizon. The dense graph retains flow dynamics across hierarchical river branches, enabling GNNs to capture distal node interactions critical for rare flood events.

However, current staging models are hardly interpretable, and most public datasets contain no clinical reasoning or interpretation beyond image-level labels. In this paper, we present a novel method that integrates graph representation learning with vision-language models (VLMs) to deliver explainable DR diagnosis. Our approach leverages optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images by constructing biologically informed graphs that encode key retinal vascular features such as vessel morphology and spatial connectivity. A graph neural network (GNN) then performs DR staging while integrated gradients highlight critical nodes and edges and their individual features that drive the classification decisions. We collect this graph-based knowledge which attributes the model's prediction to physiological structures and their characteristics. We then transform it into textual descriptions for VLMs. We perform instruction-tuning with these textual descriptions and the corresponding image to train a student VLM. This final agent can classify the disease and explain its decision in a human interpretable way solely based on a single image input. Experimental evaluations on both proprietary and public datasets demonstrate that our method not only improves classification accuracy but also offers more clinically interpretable results. An expert study further demonstrates that our method provides more accurate diagnostic explanations and paves the way for precise localization of pathologies in OCTA images.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

However, as good as GNNs are for learning graph data, they also come with the risk of privacy leakage. For instance, an attacker can run carefully crafted queries on the GNNs and, from the responses, can infer the existence of an edge between a pair of nodes. This attack, dubbed as a "link-stealing" attack, can jeopardize the user's privacy by leaking potentially sensitive information. To protect against this attack, we propose an approach called "$(N)$ode $(A)$ugmentation for $(R)$estricting $(G)$raphs from $(I)$nsinuating their $(S)$tructure" ($NARGIS$) and study its feasibility. $NARGIS$ is focused on reshaping the graph embedding space so that the posterior from the GNN model will still provide utility for the prediction task but will introduce ambiguity for the link-stealing attackers. To this end, $NARGIS$ applies spectral clustering on the given graph to facilitate it being augmented with new nodes -- that have learned features instead of fixed ones. It utilizes tri-level optimization for learning parameters for the GNN model, surrogate attacker model, and our defense model (i.e. learnable node features). We extensively evaluate $NARGIS$ on three benchmark citation datasets over eight knowledge availability settings for the attackers. We also evaluate the model fidelity and defense performance on influence-based link inference attacks. Through our studies, we have figured out the best feature of $NARGIS$ -- its superior fidelity-privacy performance trade-off in a significant number of cases. We also have discovered in which cases the model needs to be improved, and proposed ways to integrate different schemes to make the model more robust against link stealing attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint for the Accepted Work in The 15th ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy (CODASPY'25)}, 14 pages</p></details> |

Graph neural networks (GNNs) are effective methods for modeling complex graph data, such as those found in MCC. However, a significant challenge with GNNs is their reliance on an existing graph structure, which is not readily available for MCC. To address this challenge, we propose a novel generative framework for GNNs that constructs a representative underlying graph structure by utilizing the distribution of the data to enhance predictive analytics for MCC. Our framework employs a graph variational autoencoder (GVAE) to capture the complex relationships in patient data. This allows for a comprehensive understanding of individual health trajectories and facilitates the creation of diverse patient stochastic similarity graphs while preserving the original feature set. These variations of patient stochastic similarity graphs, generated from the GVAE decoder, are then processed by a GNN using a novel Laplacian regularization technique to refine the graph structure over time and improves the prediction accuracy of MCC. A contextual Bandit is designed to evaluate the stochastically generated graphs and identify the best-performing graph for the GNN model iteratively until model convergence. We validate the performance of the proposed contextual Bandit algorithm against $\varepsilon$-Greedy and multi-armed Bandit algorithms on a large cohort (n = 1,592) of patients with MCC. These advancements highlight the potential of the proposed approach to transform predictive healthcare analytics, enabling a more personalized and proactive approach to MCC management.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for review in IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics</p></details> |

The interactions involved in the predicted trajectories of agents, also called post-interactions, have rarely been considered in trajectory prediction models. To this end, we propose a coarse-to-fine Transformer for multimodal trajectory prediction, i.e., Pioformer, which explicitly extracts the post-interaction features to enhance the prediction accuracy. Specifically, we first build a Coarse Trajectory Network to generate coarse trajectories based on the observed trajectories and lane segments, in which the low-order interaction features are extracted with the graph neural networks. Next, we build a hypergraph neural network-based Trajectory Proposal Network to generate trajectory proposals, where the high-order interaction features are learned by the hypergraphs. Finally, the trajectory proposals are sent to the Proposal Refinement Network for further refinement. The observed trajectories and trajectory proposals are concatenated together as the inputs of the Proposal Refinement Network, in which the post-interaction features are learned by combining the previous interaction features and trajectory consistency features. Moreover, we propose a three-stage training scheme to facilitate the learning process. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method. Compared with the baseline HiVT-64, our model has reduced the prediction errors by 4.4%, 8.4%, 14.4%, 5.7% regarding metrics minADE6, minFDE6, MR6, and brier-minFDE6, respectively.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose SCOPE-DTI, a unified framework combining a large-scale, balanced semi-inductive human DTI dataset with advanced deep learning modeling. Constructed from 13 public repositories, the SCOPE dataset expands data volume by up to 100-fold compared to common benchmarks such as the Human dataset. The SCOPE model integrates three-dimensional protein and compound representations, graph neural networks, and bilinear attention mechanisms to effectively capture cross domain interaction patterns, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods across various DTI prediction tasks. Additionally, SCOPE-DTI provides a user-friendly interface and database. We further validate its effectiveness by experimentally identifying anticancer targets of Ginsenoside Rh1. By offering comprehensive data, advanced modeling, and accessible tools, SCOPE-DTI accelerates drug discovery research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structural Entropy Guided Unsupervised Graph Out-Of-Distribution Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03241v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emerging of huge amount of unlabeled data, unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is vital for ensuring the reliability of graph neural networks (GNNs) by identifying OOD samples from in-distribution (ID) ones during testing, where encountering novel or unknown data is inevitable. Existing methods often suffer from compromised performance due to redundant information in graph structures, which impairs their ability to effectively differentiate between ID and OOD data. To address this challenge, we propose SEGO, an unsupervised framework that integrates structural entropy into OOD detection regarding graph classification. Specifically, within the architecture of contrastive learning, SEGO introduces an anchor view in the form of coding tree by minimizing structural entropy. The obtained coding tree effectively removes redundant information from graphs while preserving essential structural information, enabling the capture of distinct graph patterns between ID and OOD samples. Furthermore, we present a multi-grained contrastive learning scheme at local, global, and tree levels using triplet views, where coding trees with essential information serve as the anchor view. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of SEGO, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in OOD detection. Specifically, our method achieves the best performance on 9 out of 10 dataset pairs, with an average improvement of 3.7\% on OOD detection datasets, significantly surpassing the best competitor by 10.8\% on the FreeSolv/ToxCast dataset pair.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025 (The 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence)</p></details> |
| **[TreeX: Generating Global Graphical GNN Explanations via Critical Subtree Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09051v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for transparency and interpretability in critical domains has driven increased interests in comprehending the explainability of Message-Passing (MP) Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Although substantial research efforts have been made to generate explanations for individual graph instances, identifying global explaining concepts for a GNN still poses great challenges, especially when concepts are desired in a graphical form on the dataset level. While most prior works treat GNNs as black boxes, in this paper, we propose to unbox GNNs by analyzing and extracting critical subtrees incurred by the inner workings of message passing, which correspond to critical subgraphs in the datasets. By aggregating subtrees in an embedding space with an efficient algorithm, which does not require complex subgraph matching or search, we can make intuitive graphical explanations for Message-Passing GNNs on local, class and global levels. We empirically show that our proposed approach not only generates clean subgraph concepts on a dataset level in contrast to existing global explaining methods which generate non-graphical rules (e.g., language or embeddings) as explanations, but it is also capable of providing explanations for individual instances with a comparable or even superior performance as compared to leading local-level GNN explainers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Backdoor Attacks with Reasonable Constraints on Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09049v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies show that graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks against GNNs use fixed-pattern triggers and lack reasonable trigger constraints, overlooking individual graph characteristics and rendering insufficient evasiveness. To tackle the above issues, we propose ABARC, the first Adaptive Backdoor Attack with Reasonable Constraints, applying to both graph-level and node-level tasks in GNNs. For graph-level tasks, we propose a subgraph backdoor attack independent of the graph's topology. It dynamically selects trigger nodes for each target graph and modifies node features with constraints based on graph similarity, feature range, and feature type. For node-level tasks, our attack begins with an analysis of node features, followed by selecting and modifying trigger features, which are then constrained by node similarity, feature range, and feature type. Furthermore, an adaptive edge-pruning mechanism is designed to reduce the impact of neighbors on target nodes, ensuring a high attack success rate (ASR). Experimental results show that even with reasonable constraints for attack evasiveness, our attack achieves a high ASR while incurring a marginal clean accuracy drop (CAD). When combined with the state-of-the-art defense randomized smoothing (RS) method, our attack maintains an ASR over 94%, surpassing existing attacks by more than 7%.</p></details> |  |

However, recent studies reveal that GNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, posing a significant threat to their real-world adoption. Despite initial efforts to defend against specific graph backdoor attacks, there is no work on defending against various types of backdoor attacks where generated triggers have different properties. Hence, we first empirically verify that prediction variance under edge dropping is a crucial indicator for identifying poisoned nodes. With this observation, we propose using random edge dropping to detect backdoors and theoretically show that it can efficiently distinguish poisoned nodes from clean ones. Furthermore, we introduce a novel robust training strategy to efficiently counteract the impact of the triggers. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our framework can effectively identify poisoned nodes, significantly degrade the attack success rate, and maintain clean accuracy when defending against various types of graph backdoor attacks with different properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[Towards Quantifying Long-Range Interactions in Graph Machine Learning: a Large Graph Dataset and a Measurement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09008v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-range dependencies are critical for effective graph representation learning, yet most existing datasets focus on small graphs tailored to inductive tasks, offering limited insight into long-range interactions. Current evaluations primarily compare models employing global attention (e.g., graph transformers) with those using local neighborhood aggregation (e.g., message-passing neural networks) without a direct measurement of long-range dependency. In this work, we introduce City-Networks, a novel large-scale transductive learning dataset derived from real-world city roads. This dataset features graphs with over $10^5$ nodes and significantly larger diameters than those in existing benchmarks, naturally embodying long-range information. We annotate the graphs using an eccentricity-based approach, ensuring that the classification task inherently requires information from distant nodes. Furthermore, we propose a model-agnostic measurement based on the Jacobians of neighbors from distant hops, offering a principled quantification of long-range dependencies. Finally, we provide theoretical justifications for both our dataset design and the proposed measurement - particularly by focusing on over-smoothing and influence score dilution - which establishes a robust foundation for further exploration of long-range interactions in graph neural networks.</p></details> | work in progress |

State-of-the-art sequential recommendation algorithms either use graph neural networks to model sessions in a graph or leverage the similarity of sessions by exploiting item features. In this paper, we combine these two approaches and propose a novel method, Graph Convolutional Network Extension (GCNext), which incorporates item features directly into the graph representation via graph convolutional networks. GCNext creates a feature-rich item co-occurrence graph and learns the corresponding item embeddings in an unsupervised manner. We show on three datasets that integrating GCNext into sequential recommendation algorithms significantly boosts the performance of nearest-neighbor methods as well as neural network models. Our flexible extension is easy to incorporate in state-of-the-art methods and increases the MRR@20 by up to 12.79%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at CARS: Workshop on Context-Aware Recommender Systems at the 16th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys) 2022</p></details> |

Specifically, given two graphs that are independent perturbations of a single random geometric graph with sparse binary features, the task is to recover an unknown one-to-one mapping between the vertices of the two graphs. We show under certain conditions on the sparsity and noise level of the feature vectors, a carefully designed two-layer graph neural network can, with high probability, recover the correct mapping between the vertices with the help of the graph structure. Additionally, we prove that our condition on the noise parameter is tight up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we compare the performance of the graph neural network to directly solving an assignment problem using the noisy vertex features and demonstrate that when the noise level is at least constant, this direct matching fails to achieve perfect recovery, whereas the graph neural network can tolerate noise levels growing as fast as a power of the size of the graph. Our theoretical findings are further supported by numerical studies as well as real-world data experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables; to appear in the Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Topology Reconstruction for Robust Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17281v3)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become fundamental in semi-supervised learning for graph representation, leveraging their ability to capture complex node relationships. A recent trend in GNN research focuses on adaptive multi-hop structure learning, moving beyond fixed-hop aggregation to more flexible and dynamic neighborhood selection. While GAMLP \citep{Zhang_2022} employs separate MLP layers for each multi-hop domain and ImprovingTE \citep{Yao2023ImprovingTE} enhances this by injecting contextualized substructure information, these methods still rely heavily on predefined sampling strategies, which may limit their ability to generalize and maintain stable accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose an \textbf{adaptive reconstruction framework} that dynamically refines multi-hop structure learning. Inspired by "coreset selection" \citep{guo2022deepcore}, our approach adaptively \textbf{reconstructs} node neighborhoods to optimize message passing, ensuring more \textbf{effective and context-aware information flow} across the graph. To further enhance structural robustness, we introduce two key modules: the \textbf{Distance Recomputator} and the \textbf{Topology Reconstructor} (\textcolor{blue}{DRTR}). The Distance Recomputator \textbf{reassesses and recalibrates} node distances based on adaptive graph properties, leading to \textbf{improved node embeddings} that better reflect latent relationships. Meanwhile, the Topology Reconstructor \textbf{dynamically refines local graph structures}, enabling the model to \textbf{adapt to evolving graph topologies} and mitigate the impact of noise and mislabeled data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our \textbf{adaptive reconstruction framework} achieves \textbf{significant improvements} over existing multi-hop-based models, providing more \textbf{stable and accurate} performance in various graph learning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, manually creating such scenarios in simulation remains a significant and time-consuming challenge. This work introduces a novel method that generates dynamic temporal scene graphs corresponding to diverse traffic scenarios, on-demand, tailored to user-defined preferences, such as AV actions, sets of dynamic agents, and criticality levels. A temporal Graph Neural Network (GNN) model learns to predict relationships between ego-vehicle, agents, and static structures, guided by real-world spatiotemporal interaction patterns and constrained by an ontology that restricts predictions to semantically valid links. Our model consistently outperforms the baselines in accurately generating links corresponding to the requested scenarios. We render the predicted scenarios in simulation to further demonstrate their effectiveness as testing environments for AV agents.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

They encode the image into a graph structure and can be beneficial for efficiently capturing the long-range dependencies typically present in remote sensing imagery. However, an important drawback of these methods is their black-box nature which may hamper their wider usage in critical applications. In this work, we tackle the self-interpretability of the graph-based vision models by proposing our Interpretable Window Vision GNN (i-WiViG) approach, which provides explanations by automatically identifying the relevant subgraphs for the model prediction. This is achieved with window-based image graph processing that constrains the node receptive field to a local image region and by using a self-interpretable graph bottleneck that ranks the importance of the long-range relations between the image regions. We evaluate our approach to remote sensing classification and regression tasks, showing it achieves competitive performance while providing inherent and faithful explanations through the identified relations. Further, the quantitative evaluation reveals that our model reduces the infidelity of post-hoc explanations compared to other Vision GNN models, without sacrificing explanation sparsity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theoretical guarantees for the advantage of GNNs over NNs in generalizing bandlimited functions on Euclidean cubes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05904v9)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as formidable resources for processing graph-based information across diverse applications. While the expressive power of GNNs has traditionally been examined in the context of graph-level tasks, their potential for node-level tasks, such as node classification, where the goal is to interpolate missing node labels from the observed ones, remains relatively unexplored. In this study, we investigate the proficiency of GNNs for such classifications, which can also be cast as a function interpolation problem. Explicitly, we focus on ascertaining the optimal configuration of weights and layers required for a GNN to successfully interpolate a band-limited function over Euclidean cubes. Our findings highlight a pronounced efficiency in utilizing GNNs to generalize a bandlimited function within an $\varepsilon$-error margin. Remarkably, achieving this task necessitates only $O_d((\log\varepsilon^{-1})^d)$ weights and $O_d((\log\varepsilon^{-1})^d)$ training samples. We explore how this criterion stacks up against the explicit constructions of currently available Neural Networks (NNs) designed for similar tasks. Significantly, our result is obtained by drawing an innovative connection between the GNN structures and classical sampling theorems. In essence, our pioneering work marks a meaningful contribution to the research domain, advancing our understanding of the practical GNN applications.</p></details> |  |

In many applications, it is impossible to observe some properties of the graph directly; instead, noisy and indirect measurements of these properties are available. These scenarios are coined as Graph Inverse Problems (GRIP). In this work, we introduce a framework leveraging GNNs to solve GRIPs. The framework is based on a combination of likelihood and prior terms, which are used to find a solution that fits the data while adhering to learned prior information. Specifically, we propose to combine recent deep learning techniques that were developed for inverse problems, together with GNN architectures, to formulate and solve GRIP. We study our approach on a number of representative problems that demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 (Oral) |

However, our understanding of the critical process of scoring neighbor nodes remains limited, leading to the underperformance of many existing attentive GNNs. In this paper, we unify the scoring functions of current attentive GNNs and propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KAA), which integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architecture into the scoring process. KAA enhances the performance of scoring functions across the board and can be applied to nearly all existing attentive GNNs. To compare the expressive power of KAA with other scoring functions, we introduce Maximum Ranking Distance (MRD) to quantitatively estimate their upper bounds in ranking errors for node importance. Our analysis reveals that, under limited parameters and constraints on width and depth, both linear transformation-based and MLP-based scoring functions exhibit finite expressive power. In contrast, our proposed KAA, even with a single-layer KAN parameterized by zero-order B-spline functions, demonstrates nearly infinite expressive power. Extensive experiments on both node-level and graph-level tasks using various backbone models show that KAA-enhanced scoring functions consistently outperform their original counterparts, achieving performance improvements of over 20% in some cases.</p></details> |  |

Existing $\textit{end-to-end learning}$ methods for MILP generate values for a subset of decision variables and delegate the remaining problem to traditional MILP solvers. However, this approach often fails to guarantee solution feasibility (i.e., satisfying all constraints) due to inaccurate predictions and primarily focuses on binary decision variables. Satisfying all constraints is a prerequisite for obtaining the optimal solution, and the feasibility issue becomes even more critical with non-binary integer (integer, for short) variables. Thus, addressing the feasibility of MILP involving integer variables is crucial. To address these challenges, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based solver that not only finds the first feasible solution but also incrementally discovers better feasible solutions without delegating the remainder to off-the-shelf solvers.

However, the limited availability of molecular data raises concerns regarding GNNs' ability to effectively capture the fundamental principles of physics and chemistry, which constrains their generalization capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel self-supervised approach termed Equivariant Masked Position Prediction (EMPP), grounded in intramolecular potential and force theory. Unlike conventional attribute masking techniques, EMPP formulates a nuanced position prediction task that is more well-defined and enhances the learning of quantum mechanical features. EMPP also bypasses the approximation of the Gaussian mixture distribution commonly used in denoising methods, allowing for more accurate acquisition of physical properties. Experimental results indicate that EMPP significantly enhances performance of advanced molecular architectures, surpassing state-of-the-art self-supervised approaches.

Although Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) efficiently quantifies uncertainty using a Dirichlet distribution over predictive probabilities, existing EDL-based GNN (EGNN) models require modifications to the network architecture and retraining, failing to take advantage of pre-trained models. We propose a plug-and-play framework for uncertainty quantification in GNNs that works with pre-trained models without the need for retraining. Our Evidential Probing Network (EPN) uses a lightweight Multi-Layer-Perceptron (MLP) head to extract evidence from learned representations, allowing efficient integration with various GNN architectures. We further introduce evidence-based regularization techniques, referred to as EPN-reg, to enhance the estimation of epistemic uncertainty with theoretical justifications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed EPN-reg achieves state-of-the-art performance in accurate and efficient uncertainty quantification, making it suitable for real-world deployment.</p></details> | AISTATS 2025 |

Although GNNs have shown great promise in handling traffic datasets, their deployment in real-life applications has been hindered by scalability constraints arising from high-order message passing. Additionally, the over-smoothing problem of GNNs may lead to indistinguishable region representations as the number of layers increases, resulting in performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a new knowledge distillation paradigm termed LightST that transfers spatial and temporal knowledge from a high-capacity teacher to a lightweight student. Specifically, we introduce a spatio-temporal knowledge distillation framework that helps student MLPs capture graph-structured global spatio-temporal patterns while alleviating the over-smoothing effect with adaptive knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments verify that LightST significantly speeds up traffic flow predictions by 5X to 40X compared to state-of-the-art spatio-temporal GNNs, all while maintaining superior accuracy.</p></details> | 9 pages |

We propose HIS_GCNs, a hierarchical importance graph sampling based learning method. By constructing minibatches using sampled subgraphs, HIS_GCNs gives attention to the importance of both core and periphery nodes/edges in a scale-free training graph. Specifically, it preserves the centrum of the core to most minibatches, which maintains connectivity between periphery nodes, and samples periphery edges without core node interference, in order to keep more long chains composed entirely of low-degree nodes in the same minibatch. HIS_GCNs can maximize the discrete Ricci curvature (i.e., Ollivier-Ricci curvatures) of the edges in a subgraph that enables the preservation of important chains for information propagation, and can achieve a low node embedding variance and a high convergence speed. Diverse experiments on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with node classification tasks confirm superior performance of HIS_GCNs in both accuracy and training time.

These interactions can be effectively represented as time-evolving graphs, where predicting future connections is a key task in applications such as recommendation systems. Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have achieved strong results for such predictive tasks but typically require extensive training data, which is often limited in real-world scenarios. One approach to mitigating data scarcity is leveraging pre-trained models from related datasets. However, direct knowledge transfer between TGNNs is challenging due to their reliance on node-specific memory structures, making them inherently difficult to adapt across datasets. To address this, we introduce a novel transfer approach that disentangles node representations from their associated features through a structured bipartite encoding mechanism. This decoupling enables more effective transfer of memory components and other learned inductive patterns from one dataset to another. Empirical evaluations on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances TGNN performance in low-data regimes, outperforming non-transfer baselines by up to 56\% and surpassing existing transfer strategies by 36\%</p></details> |  |

However, due to the deformable nature of fabrics, these operations remain a significant challenge for robots in household, healthcare, and industrial environments. In this paper, we propose GraphGarment, a novel approach that models garment dynamics based on robot control inputs and applies the learned dynamics model to facilitate garment manipulation tasks such as hanging. Specifically, we use graphs to represent the interactions between the robot end-effector and the garment. GraphGarment uses a graph neural network (GNN) to learn a dynamics model that can predict the next garment state given the current state and input action in simulation. To address the substantial sim-to-real gap, we propose a residual model that compensates for garment state prediction errors, thereby improving real-world performance. The garment dynamics model is then applied to a model-based action sampling strategy, where it is utilized to manipulate the garment to a reference pre-hanging configuration for garment-hanging tasks. We conducted four experiments using six types of garments to validate our approach in both simulation and real-world settings. In simulation experiments, GraphGarment achieves better garment state prediction performance, with a prediction error 0.46 cm lower than the best baseline. Our approach also demonstrates improved performance in the garment-hanging simulation experiment with enhancements of 12%, 24%, and 10%, respectively. Moreover, real-world robot experiments confirm the robustness of sim-to-real transfer, with an error increase of 0.17 cm compared to simulation results.
