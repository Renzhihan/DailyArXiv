| **[Meta-Posterior Consistency for the Bayesian Inference of Metastable System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01868v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vast majority of the literature on learning dynamical systems or stochastic processes from time series has focused on stable or ergodic systems, for both Bayesian and frequentist inference procedures. However, most real-world systems are only metastable, that is, the dynamics appear to be stable on some time scale, but are in fact unstable over longer time scales. Consistency of inference for metastable systems may not be possible, but one can ask about metaconsistency: Do inference procedures converge when observations are taken over a large but finite time interval, but diverge on longer time scales? In this paper we introduce, discuss, and quantify metaconsistency in a Bayesian framework. We discuss how metaconsistency can be exploited to efficiently infer a model for a sub-system of a larger system, where inference on the global behavior may require much more data, or there is no theoretical guarantee as to the asymptotic success of inference procedures. We also discuss the relation between metaconsistency and the spectral properties of the model dynamical system in the case of uniformly ergodic and non-ergodic diffusions.</p></details> | 32 pages, 3 figures |
| **[LangTime: A Language-Guided Unified Model for Time Series Forecasting with Proximal Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08271v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has shown an increasing interest in utilizing pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for a variety of time series applications. However, there are three main challenges when using LLMs as foundational models for time series forecasting: (1) Cross-domain generalization. (2) Cross-modality alignment. (3) Error accumulation in autoregressive frameworks. To address these challenges, we proposed LangTime, a language-guided unified model for time series forecasting that incorporates cross-domain pre-training with reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning. Specifically, LangTime constructs Temporal Comprehension Prompts (TCPs), which include dataset-wise and channel-wise instructions, to facilitate domain adaptation and condense time series into a single token, enabling LLMs to understand better and align temporal data. To improve autoregressive forecasting, we introduce TimePPO, a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning algorithm. TimePPO mitigates error accumulation by leveraging a multidimensional rewards function tailored for time series and a repeat-based value estimation strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LangTime achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain forecasting performance, while TimePPO fine-tuning effectively enhances the stability and accuracy of autoregressive forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Over the Stability Space of a Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22407v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper jointly addresses the challenges of non-stationarity and high dimensionality in analysing multivariate time series. Building on the classical concept of cointegration, we introduce a more flexible notion, called stability space, aimed at capturing stationary components in settings where traditional assumptions may not hold. Based on the dimensionality reduction techniques of Partial Least Squares and Principal Component Analysis, we proposed two non-parametric procedures for estimating such a space and a targeted selection of components that prioritises stationarity. We compare these alternatives with the parametric Johansen procedure, when possible. Through simulations and real-data applications, we evaluated the performance of these methodologies across various scenarios, including high-dimensional configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Towards Efficient Parametric State Estimation in Circulating Fuel Reactors with Shallow Recurrent Decoder Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08904v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent developments in data-driven methods have paved the way to new methodologies to provide accurate state reconstruction of engineering systems; nuclear reactors represent particularly challenging applications for this task due to the complexity of the strongly coupled physics involved and the extremely harsh and hostile environments, especially for new technologies such as Generation-IV reactors. Data-driven techniques can combine different sources of information, including computational proxy models and local noisy measurements on the system, to robustly estimate the state. This work leverages the novel Shallow Recurrent Decoder architecture to infer the entire state vector (including neutron fluxes, precursors concentrations, temperature, pressure and velocity) of a reactor from three out-of-core time-series neutron flux measurements alone. In particular, this work extends the standard architecture to treat parametric time-series data, ensuring the possibility of investigating different accidental scenarios and showing the capabilities of this approach to provide an accurate state estimation in various operating conditions. This paper considers as a test case the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR), a Generation-IV reactor concept, characterised by strong coupling between the neutronics and the thermal hydraulics due to the liquid nature of the fuel. The promising results of this work are further strengthened by the possibility of quantifying the uncertainty associated with the state estimation, due to the considerably low training cost. The accurate reconstruction of every characteristic field in real-time makes this approach suitable for monitoring and control purposes in the framework of a reactor digital twin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Teaching Time Series to See and Speak: Forecasting with Aligned Visual and Textual Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24124v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting traditionally relies on unimodal numerical inputs, which often struggle to capture high-level semantic patterns due to their dense and unstructured nature. While recent approaches have explored representing time series as text using large language models (LLMs), these methods remain limited by the discrete nature of token sequences and lack the perceptual intuition humans typically apply, such as interpreting visual patterns. In this paper, we propose a multimodal contrastive learning framework that transforms raw time series into structured visual and textual perspectives. Rather than using natural language or real-world images, we construct both modalities directly from numerical sequences. We then align these views in a shared semantic space via contrastive learning, enabling the model to capture richer and more complementary representations. Furthermore, we introduce a variate selection module that leverages the aligned representations to identify the most informative variables for multivariate forecasting. Extensive experiments on fifteen short-term and six long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms strong unimodal and cross-modal baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal alignment in enhancing time series forecasting.

| **[Identifying Systems with Symmetries using Equivariant Autoregressive Reservoir Computers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09511v3)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The investigation reported in this document focuses on identifying systems with symmetries using equivariant autoregressive reservoir computers. General results in structured matrix approximation theory are presented, exploring a two-fold approach. Firstly, a comprehensive examination of generic symmetry-preserving nonlinear time delay embedding is conducted. This involves analyzing time series data sampled from an equivariant system under study. Secondly, sparse least-squares methods are applied to discern approximate representations of the output coupling matrices. These matrices play a critical role in determining the nonlinear autoregressive representation of an equivariant system. The structural characteristics of these matrices are dictated by the set of symmetries inherent in the system. The document outlines prototypical algorithms derived from the described techniques, offering insight into their practical applications. Emphasis is placed on the significant improvement on structured identification precision when compared to classical reservoir computing methods for the simulation of equivariant dynamical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>The v...</summary><p>The views expressed in the article do not necessarily represent the views of the National Commission of Banks and Insurance Companies of Honduras</p></details> |
| **[Constructing Non-Markovian Decision Process via History Aggregator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24026v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the domain of algorithmic decision-making, non-Markovian dynamics manifest as a significant impediment, especially for paradigms such as Reinforcement Learning (RL), thereby exerting far-reaching consequences on the advancement and effectiveness of the associated systems. Nevertheless, the existing benchmarks are deficient in comprehensively assessing the capacity of decision algorithms to handle non-Markovian dynamics. To address this deficiency, we have devised a generalized methodology grounded in category theory. Notably, we established the category of Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and the category of non-Markovian Decision Processes (NMDP), and proved the equivalence relationship between them. This theoretical foundation provides a novel perspective for understanding and addressing non-Markovian dynamics. We further introduced non-Markovianity into decision-making problem settings via the History Aggregator for State (HAS). With HAS, we can precisely control the state dependency structure of decision-making problems in the time series. Our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in representing a broad range of non-Markovian dynamics. This approach facilitates a more rigorous and flexible evaluation of decision algorithms by testing them in problem settings where non-Markovian dynamics are explicitly constructed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online model learning with data-assimilated reservoir computers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16767v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an online learning framework for forecasting nonlinear spatio-temporal signals (fields). The method integrates (i) dimensionality reduction, here, a simple proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) projection; (ii) a generalized autoregressive model to forecast reduced dynamics, here, a reservoir computer; (iii) online adaptation to update the reservoir computer (the model), here, ensemble sequential data assimilation. We demonstrate the framework on a wake past a cylinder governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, exploring the assimilation of full flow fields (projected onto POD modes) and sparse sensors. Three scenarios are examined: a na\"ive physical state estimation; a two-fold estimation of physical and reservoir states; and a three-fold estimation that also adjusts the model parameters. The two-fold strategy significantly improves ensemble convergence and reduces reconstruction error compared to the na\"ive approach. The three-fold approach enables robust online training of partially-trained reservoir computers, overcoming limitations of a priori training. By unifying data-driven reduced order modelling with Bayesian data assimilation, this work opens new opportunities for scalable online model learning for nonlinear time series forecasting.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[When Will It Fail?: Anomaly to Prompt for Forecasting Future Anomalies in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23596v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, forecasting future abnormal events has emerged as an important scenario to tackle real-world necessities. However, the solution of predicting specific future time points when anomalies will occur, known as Anomaly Prediction (AP), remains under-explored. Existing methods dealing with time series data fail in AP, focusing only on immediate anomalies or failing to provide precise predictions for future anomalies. To address the AP task, we propose a novel framework called Anomaly to Prompt (A2P), comprised of Anomaly-Aware Forecasting (AAF) and Synthetic Anomaly Prompting (SAP). To enable the forecasting model to forecast abnormal time points, we adopt a strategy to learn the relationships of anomalies. For the robust detection of anomalies, our proposed SAP introduces a learnable Anomaly Prompt Pool (APP) that simulates diverse anomaly patterns using signal adaptive prompt. Comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of A2P over state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its ability to predict future anomalies. Our implementation code is available at https://github.com/KU-VGI/AP.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures, 12 tables, ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Bridging Subjective and Objective QoE: Operator-Level Aggregation Using LLM-Based Comment Analysis and Network MOS Comparison](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00924v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a dual-layer framework for network operator-side quality of experience (QoE) assessment that integrates both objective network modeling and subjective user perception extracted from live-streaming platforms. On the objective side, we develop a machine learning model trained on mean opinion scores (MOS) computed via the ITU-T P.1203 reference implementation, allowing accurate prediction of user-perceived video quality using only network parameters such as packet loss, delay, jitter, and throughput without reliance on video content or client-side instrumentation. On the subjective side, we present a semantic filtering and scoring pipeline that processes user comments from live streams to extract performance-related feedback. A large language model is used to assign scalar MOS scores to filtered comments in a deterministic and reproducible manner. To support scalable and interpretable analysis, we construct a labeled dataset of 47,894 live-stream comments, of which about 34,000 are identified as QoE-relevant through multi-layer semantic filtering. Each comment is enriched with simulated Internet Service Provider attribution and temporally aligned using synthetic timestamps in 5-min intervals. The resulting dataset enables operator-level aggregation and time-series analysis of user-perceived quality. A delta MOS metric is proposed to measure each Internet service provider's deviation from platform-wide sentiment, allowing detection of localized degradations even in the absence of direct network telemetry. A controlled outage simulation confirms the framework's effectiveness in identifying service disruptions through comment-based trends alone. The system provides each operator with its own subjective MOS and the global platform average per interval, enabling real-time interpretation of performance deviations and comparison with objective network-based QoE estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pp...</summary><p>19 ppages, 13 figures</p></details> |
| **[Accurate Parameter-Efficient Test-Time Adaptation for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23424v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world time series often exhibit a non-stationary nature, degrading the performance of pre-trained forecasting models. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adjusting models during inference, but existing methods typically update the full model, increasing memory and compute costs. We propose PETSA, a parameter-efficient method that adapts forecasters at test time by only updating small calibration modules on the input and output. PETSA uses low-rank adapters and dynamic gating to adjust representations without retraining. To maintain accuracy despite limited adaptation capacity, we introduce a specialized loss combining three components: (1) a robust term, (2) a frequency-domain term to preserve periodicity, and (3) a patch-wise structural term for structural alignment. PETSA improves the adaptability of various forecasting backbones while requiring fewer parameters than baselines. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that PETSA achieves competitive or better performance across all horizons. Our code is available at: https://github.com/BorealisAI/PETSA</p></details> | <details><summary>Secon...</summary><p>Second Workshop on Test-Time Adaptation: Putting Updates to the Test! at ICML 2025, Vancouver, Canada. 2025</p></details> |
| **[Deep Multi-Manifold Transformation Based Multivariate Time Series Fault Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16258v2)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised fault detection in multivariate time series plays a vital role in ensuring the stable operation of complex systems. Traditional methods often assume that normal data follow a single Gaussian distribution and identify anomalies as deviations from this distribution. {\color{black} However, this simplified assumption fails to capture the diversity and structural complexity of real-world time series, which can lead to misjudgments and reduced detection performance in practical applications. To address this issue, we propose a new method that combines a neighborhood-driven data augmentation strategy with a multi-manifold representation learning framework.} By incorporating information from local neighborhoods, the augmentation module can simulate contextual variations of normal data, enhancing the model's adaptability to distributional changes. In addition, we design a structure-aware feature learning approach that encourages natural clustering of similar patterns in the feature space while maintaining sufficient distinction between different operational states. Extensive experiments on several public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in terms of both accuracy and robustness, showing strong potential for generalization and real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, accepted by TNNLS</p></details> |
| **[Automating Versatile Time-Series Analysis with Tiny Transformers on Embedded FPGAs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17662v4)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models have shown strong performance across diverse time-series tasks, but their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to high memory and computational demand. While prior work targeting Microcontroller Units (MCUs) has explored hardware-specific optimizations, such approaches are often task-specific and limited to 8-bit fixed-point precision. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer greater flexibility, enabling fine-grained control over data precision and architecture. However, existing FPGA-based deployments of Transformers for time-series analysis typically focus on high-density platforms with manual configuration. This paper presents a unified and fully automated deployment framework for Tiny Transformers on embedded FPGAs. Our framework supports a compact encoder-only Transformer architecture across three representative time-series tasks (forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection). It combines quantization-aware training (down to 4 bits), hardware-aware hyperparameter search using Optuna, and automatic VHDL generation for seamless deployment. We evaluate our framework on six public datasets across two embedded FPGA platforms. Results show that our framework produces integer-only, task-specific Transformer accelerators achieving as low as 0.033 mJ per inference with millisecond latency on AMD Spartan-7, while also providing insights into deployment feasibility on Lattice iCE40. All source code will be released in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Edwina1030/TinyTransformer4TS).</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, accepted by IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[maneuverRecognition -- A Python package for Timeseries Classification in the domain of Vehicle Telematics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23147v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the domain of vehicle telematics the automated recognition of driving maneuvers is used to classify and evaluate driving behaviour. This not only serves as a component to enhance the personalization of insurance policies, but also to increase road safety, reduce accidents and the associated costs as well as to reduce fuel consumption and support environmentally friendly driving. In this context maneuver recognition technically requires a continuous application of time series classification which poses special challenges to the transfer, preprocessing and storage of telematic sensor data, the training of predictive models, and the prediction itself. Although much research has been done in the field of gathering relevant data or regarding the methods to build predictive models for the task of maneuver recognition, there is a practical need for python packages and functions that allow to quickly transform data into the required structure as well as to build and evaluate such models. The maneuverRecognition package was therefore developed to provide the necessary functions for preprocessing, modelling and evaluation and also includes a ready to use LSTM based network structure that can be modified. The implementation of the package is demonstrated using real driving data of three different persons recorded via smartphone sensors.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |
| **[TyphoFormer: Language-Augmented Transformer for Accurate Typhoon Track Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17609v2)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate typhoon track forecasting is crucial for early system warning and disaster response. While Transformer-based models have demonstrated strong performance in modeling the temporal dynamics of dense trajectories of humans and vehicles in smart cities, they usually lack access to broader contextual knowledge that enhances the forecasting reliability of sparse meteorological trajectories, such as typhoon tracks. To address this challenge, we propose TyphoFormer, a novel framework that incorporates natural language descriptions as auxiliary prompts to improve typhoon trajectory forecasting. For each time step, we use Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise textual descriptions based on the numerical attributes recorded in the North Atlantic hurricane database. The language descriptions capture high-level meteorological semantics and are embedded as auxiliary special tokens prepended to the numerical time series input. By integrating both textual and sequential information within a unified Transformer encoder, TyphoFormer enables the model to leverage contextual cues that are otherwise inaccessible through numerical features alone. Extensive experiments are conducted on HURDAT2 benchmark, results show that TyphoFormer consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly under challenging scenarios involving nonlinear path shifts and limited historical observations.</p></details> | Short research paper |
| **[Simultaneous Sieve Estimation and Inference for Time-Varying Nonlinear Time Series Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23069v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate time-varying nonlinear time series regression for a broad class of locally stationary time series. First, we propose sieve nonparametric estimators for the time-varying regression functions that achieve uniform consistency. Second, we develop a unified simultaneous inferential theory to conduct both structural and exact form tests on these functions. Additionally, we introduce a multiplier bootstrap procedure for practical implementation. Our methodology and theory require only mild assumptions on the regression functions, allow for unbounded domain support, and effectively address the issue of identifiability for practical interpretation. Technically, we establish sieve approximation theory for 2-D functions in unbounded domains, prove two Gaussian approximation results for affine forms of high-dimensional locally stationary time series, and calculate critical values for the maxima of the Gaussian random field arising from locally stationary time series, which may be of independent interest. Numerical simulations and two data analyses support our results, and we have developed an $\mathtt{R}$ package, $\mathtt{SIMle}$, to facilitate implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>67 pa...</summary><p>67 pages, 10 figures.

| **[Fetuses Made Simple: Modeling and Tracking of Fetal Shape and Pose](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17858v2)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing fetal body motion and shape is paramount in prenatal diagnostics and monitoring. Existing methods for fetal MRI analysis mainly rely on anatomical keypoints or volumetric body segmentations. Keypoints simplify body structure to facilitate motion analysis, but may ignore important details of full-body shape. Body segmentations capture complete shape information but complicate temporal analysis due to large non-local fetal movements. To address these limitations, we construct a 3D articulated statistical fetal body model based on the Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model (SMPL). Our algorithm iteratively estimates body pose in the image space and body shape in the canonical pose space. This approach improves robustness to MRI motion artifacts and intensity distortions, and reduces the impact of incomplete surface observations due to challenging fetal poses. We train our model on segmentations and keypoints derived from $19,816$ MRI volumes across $53$ subjects. Our model captures body shape and motion across time series and provides intuitive visualization. Furthermore, it enables automated anthropometric measurements traditionally difficult to obtain from segmentations and keypoints. When tested on unseen fetal body shapes, our method yields a surface alignment error of $3.2$ mm for $3$ mm MRI voxel size. To our knowledge, this represents the first 3D articulated statistical fetal body model, paving the way for enhanced fetal motion and shape analysis in prenatal diagnostics.

| **[Adaptive Anomaly Detection in the Presence of Concept Drift: Extended Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15831v2)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The presence of concept drift poses challenges for anomaly detection in time series. While anomalies are caused by undesirable changes in the data, differentiating abnormal changes from varying normal behaviours is difficult due to differing frequencies of occurrence, varying time intervals when normal patterns occur, and identifying similarity thresholds to separate the boundary between normal vs. abnormal sequences. Differentiating between concept drift and anomalies is critical for accurate analysis as studies have shown that the compounding effects of error propagation in downstream tasks lead to lower detection accuracy and increased overhead due to unnecessary model updates. Unfortunately, existing work has largely explored anomaly detection and concept drift detection in isolation. We introduce AnDri, a framework for Anomaly detection in the presence of Drift. AnDri introduces the notion of a dynamic normal model where normal patterns are activated, deactivated or newly added, providing flexibility to adapt to concept drift and anomalies over time. We introduce a new clustering method, Adjacent Hierarchical Clustering (AHC), for learning normal patterns that respect their temporal locality; critical for detecting short-lived, but recurring patterns that are overlooked by existing methods. Our evaluation shows AnDri outperforms existing baselines using real datasets with varying types, proportions, and distributions of concept drift and anomalies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version (to be updated)</p></details> |

This study utilizes digital cognitive tasks with eye-tracking data correlated with memory processes to distinguish between Healthy Controls (HC) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a precursor to dementia. A deep learning model based on VTNet was trained using eye-tracking data from 44 participants (24 MCI, 20 HCs) who performed a visual memory task. The model utilizes both time series and spatial data derived from eye-tracking. It was modified to incorporate scan paths, heat maps, and image content. These modifications also enabled testing parameters such as image resolution and task performance, analyzing their impact on model performance. The best model, utilizing $700\times700px$ resolution heatmaps, achieved 68% sensitivity and 76% specificity. Despite operating under more challenging conditions (e.g., smaller dataset size, shorter task duration, or a less standardized task), the model's performance is comparable to an Alzheimer's study using similar methods (70% sensitivity and 73% specificity). These findings contribute to the development of automated diagnostic tools for MCI. Future work should focus on refining the model and using a standardized long-term visual memory task.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Foundation Models for Wearable Movement Data in Mental Health Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15240v4)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained foundation models and transformer architectures have driven the success of large language models (LLMs) and other modern AI breakthroughs. However, similar advancements in health data modeling remain limited due to the need for innovative adaptations. Wearable movement data offers a valuable avenue for exploration, as it's a core feature in nearly all commercial smartwatches, well established in clinical and mental health research, and the sequential nature of the data shares similarities to language. We introduce the Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer (PAT), the first open source foundation model designed for time-series wearable movement data. Leveraging transformer-based architectures and novel techniques, such as patch embeddings, and pretraining on data from 29,307 participants in a national U.S. sample, PAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in several mental health prediction tasks. PAT is also lightweight and easily interpretable, making it a robust tool for mental health research. GitHub: https://github.com/njacobsonlab/Pretrained-Actigraphy-Transformer/</p></details> |  |
| **[Cybersecurity-Focused Anomaly Detection in Connected Autonomous Vehicles Using Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22984v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is crucial for maintaining safe and reliable transportation networks, as CAVs can be susceptible to sensor malfunctions, cyber-attacks, and unexpected environmental disruptions. This study explores an anomaly detection approach by simulating vehicle behavior, generating a dataset that represents typical and atypical vehicular interactions. The dataset includes time-series data of position, speed, and acceleration for multiple connected autonomous vehicles. We utilized machine learning models to effectively identify abnormal driving patterns. First, we applied a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to capture temporal dependencies and sequence-based anomalies. The stacked LSTM model processed the sequential data to learn standard driving behaviors. Additionally, we deployed a Random Forest model to support anomaly detection by offering ensemble-based predictions, which enhanced model interpretability and performance. The Random Forest model achieved an R2 of 0.9830, MAE of 5.746, and a 95th percentile anomaly threshold of 14.18, while the stacked LSTM model attained an R2 of 0.9998, MAE of 82.425, and a 95th percentile anomaly threshold of 265.63. These results demonstrate the models' effectiveness in accurately predicting vehicle trajectories and detecting anomalies in autonomous driving scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods and datasets remain focused on a narrow spectrum of tasks, such as forecasting or anomaly detection. To bridge this gap, we introduce Time Series Multi-Task Question Answering (Time-MQA), a unified framework that enables natural language queries across multiple time series tasks - numerical analytical tasks and open-ended question answering with reasoning. Central to Time-MQA is the TSQA dataset, a large-scale dataset containing $\sim$200k question-answer pairs derived from diverse time series spanning environment, traffic, etc. This comprehensive resource covers various time series lengths and promotes robust model development. We further demonstrate how continually pre-training large language models (Mistral 7B, Llama-3 8B, and Qwen-2.5 7B) on the TSQA dataset enhanced time series reasoning capabilities, moving beyond mere numeric tasks and enabling more advanced and intuitive interactions with temporal data. The complete TSQA dataset, models, user study questionnaires for evaluation, and other related materials have been open-sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>Annua...</summary><p>Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2025, Main)</p></details> |

Transformers have remarkable success mostly in natural language processing using attention mechanism, which also influenced the time series community. The ability to capture both short and long-range dependencies helps to understand the financial market and to recognize price patterns, leading to successful applications of Transformers in stock prediction. Although, the previous research predominantly focuses on individual features and singular predictions, that limits the model's ability to understand broader market trends. In reality, within sectors such as finance and technology, companies belonging to the same industry often exhibit correlated stock price movements. In this paper, we develop a novel neural network architecture by integrating Time2Vec with the Encoder of the Transformer model. Based on the study of different markets, we propose a novel correlation feature selection method. Through a comprehensive fine-tuning of multiple hyperparameters, we conduct a comparative analysis of our results against benchmark models. We conclude that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art encoding methods such as positional encoding, and we also conclude that selecting correlation features enhance the accuracy of predicting multiple stock prices.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, Eusipco 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Time Series Generation Conditioned on Unstructured Natural Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22927v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly become a powerful tool, capable of generating various types of data, such as images and text. However, despite the significant advancement of generative AI, time series generative AI remains underdeveloped, even though the application of time series is essential in finance, climate, and numerous fields. In this research, we propose a novel method of generating time series conditioned on unstructured natural language descriptions. We use a diffusion model combined with a language model to generate time series from the text. Through the proposed method, we demonstrate that time series generation based on natural language is possible. The proposed method can provide various applications such as custom forecasting, time series manipulation, data augmentation, and transfer learning. Furthermore, we construct and propose a new public dataset for time series generation, consisting of 63,010 time series-description pairs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Time Series Autoregression for Periodicity Quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22895v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series autoregression is a classical statistical model for capturing auto-correlations and identifying temporal patterns such as periodicity and seasonality. In this work, we propose a novel sparse autoregression framework from an interpretable machine learning perspective and the model interpretability for periodicity quantification is reinforced by $\ell_0$-norm induced sparsity constraints. On the time-varying time series data, we reformulate the sparse autoregression and convert the involved optimization problem into a mixed-integer optimization (MIO). To accelerate it, we develop a subspace pursuit based decision variable pruning (DVP) strategy to reduce the search space. On the multidimensional time series that involves complicated spatial and temporal dimensions, we propose a spatially- and time-varying sparse autoregression model and resolve the corresponding MIO problem by developing a two-stage optimization scheme. In particular, the proposed scheme makes the model scalable to large problems even with millions of decision variables. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed models on real-world time series data. First, we demonstrate that the MIO solver can be drastically accelerated through the DVP strategy, while maintaining the same solution quality as a full MIO solver. Applying the time-varying sparse autoregression model to ridesharing trip data, we uncover both daily and weekly periodicities and reveal long-term changes in regularity of human mobility. Second, we demonstrate the spatial patterns of yearly seasonality in climate variable time series such as temperature and precipitation across the past four decades, and our model allows to discover dynamic climate patterns and identify climate phenomena such as El Nino in sea surface temperature.</p></details> |  |
| **[FuzzCoh: Robust Canonical Coherence-Based Fuzzy Clustering of Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22861v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain cognitive and sensory functions are often associated with electrophysiological activity at specific frequency bands. Clustering multivariate time series (MTS) data like EEGs is important for understanding brain functions but challenging due to complex non-stationary cross-dependencies, gradual transitions between cognitive states, noisy measurements, and ambiguous cluster boundaries. To address these issues, we develop a robust fuzzy clustering framework in the spectral domain. Our method leverages Kendall's tau-based canonical coherence, which extracts meaningful frequency-specific monotonic relationships between groups of channels or regions. KenCoh effectively captures dominant coherence structures while remaining robust against outliers and noise, making it suitable for real EEG datasets that typically contain artifacts. Our method first projects each MTS object onto vectors derived from the KenCoh estimates (i.e, canonical directions), which capture relevant information on the connectivity structure of oscillatory signals in predefined frequency bands. These spectral features are utilized to determine clusters of epochs using a fuzzy partitioning strategy, accommodating gradual transitions and overlapping class structure. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to EEG data where latent cognitive states such as alertness and drowsiness exhibit frequency-specific dynamics and ambiguity. Our method captures both spectral and spatial features by locating the frequency-dependent structure and brain functional connectivity. Built on the KenCoh framework for fuzzy clustering, it handles the complexity of high-dimensional time series data and is broadly applicable to domains such as neuroscience, wearable sensing, environmental monitoring, and finance.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have focused on the applicability of QNNs to various tasks, such as time-series forecasting, prediction, and classification, across a wide range of applications, including cybersecurity and medical imaging. With the increased use of smart grids driven by the integration of renewable energy systems, machine learning plays an important role in predicting power demand and detecting system disturbances. This study provides an in-depth investigation of QNNs for predicting the power output of a wind turbine. We assess the predictive performance and simulation time of six QNN configurations that are based on the Z Feature Map for data encoding and varying ansatz structures. Through detailed cross-validation experiments and tests on an unseen hold-out dataset, we experimentally demonstrate that QNNs can achieve predictive performance that is competitive with, and in some cases marginally better than, the benchmarked classical approaches. Our results also reveal the effects of dataset size and circuit complexity on predictive performance and simulation time. We believe our findings will offer valuable insights for researchers in the energy domain who wish to incorporate quantum machine learning into their work.</p></details> |  |
| **[xLSTMAD: A Powerful xLSTM-based Method for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22837v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently proposed xLSTM is a powerful model that leverages expressive multiplicative gating and residual connections, providing the temporal capacity needed for long-horizon forecasting and representation learning. This architecture has demonstrated success in time series forecasting, lossless compression, and even large-scale language modeling tasks, where its linear memory footprint and fast inference make it a viable alternative to Transformers. Despite its growing popularity, no prior work has explored xLSTM for anomaly detection. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing xLSTMAD, the first anomaly detection method that integrates a full encoder-decoder xLSTM architecture, purpose-built for multivariate time series data. Our encoder processes input sequences to capture historical context, while the decoder is devised in two separate variants of the method. In the forecasting approach, the decoder iteratively generates forecasted future values xLSTMAD-F, while the reconstruction approach reconstructs the input time series from its encoded counterpart xLSTMAD-R. We investigate the performance of two loss functions: Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Soft Dynamic Time Warping (SoftDTW) to consider local reconstruction fidelity and global sequence alignment, respectively. We evaluate our method on the comprehensive TSB-AD-M benchmark, which spans 17 real-world datasets, using state-of-the-art challenging metrics such as VUS-PR. In our results, xLSTM showcases state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming 23 popular anomaly detection baselines. Our paper is the first work revealing the powerful modeling capabilities of xLSTM for anomaly detection, paving the way for exciting new developments on this subject.

| **[Partial Information Rate Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04550v3)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial Information Decomposition (PID) is a principled and flexible method to unveil complex high-order interactions in multi-unit network systems. Though being defined exclusively for random variables, PID is ubiquitously applied to multivariate time series taken as realizations of random processes with temporal statistical structure. Here, to overcome the incorrect depiction of high-order effects by PID schemes applied to dynamic networks, we introduce the framework of Partial Information Rate Decomposition (PIRD). PIRD is first formalized applying lattice theory to decompose the information shared dynamically between a target random process and a set of source processes, and then implemented for Gaussian processes through a spectral expansion of information rates. The new framework is validated in simulated network systems and demonstrated in the practical analysis of time series from large-scale climate oscillations.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose DRAGON (Discrete Representation and Augmented Graph encoding Over de BruijN Graphs), a novel encoder that introduces Multivariate de Bruijn Graphs (MdBGs) to bridge the gap between symbolic representations and neural modeling. DRAGON discretizes continuous input sequences and maps them onto a fixed graph structure, enabling dynamic context recovery via graph-based attention. Integrated as an auxiliary module within a dual-branch architecture, DRAGON augments conventional CNN-based encoders with symbolic, structure-aware representations.

Trajectory enabled Unified Online Detection of Adversarial Examples and Backdoor Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22722v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proposed UniGuard is the first unified online detection framework capable of simultaneously addressing adversarial examples and backdoor attacks. UniGuard builds upon two key insights: first, both AE and backdoor attacks have to compromise the inference phase, making it possible to tackle them simultaneously during run-time via online detection. Second, an adversarial input, whether a perturbed sample in AE attacks or a trigger-carrying sample in backdoor attacks, exhibits distinctive trajectory signatures from a benign sample as it propagates through the layers of a DL model in forward inference. The propagation trajectory of the adversarial sample must deviate from that of its benign counterpart; otherwise, the adversarial objective cannot be fulfilled. Detecting these trajectory signatures is inherently challenging due to their subtlety; UniGuard overcomes this by treating the propagation trajectory as a time-series signal, leveraging LSTM and spectrum transformation to amplify differences between adversarial and benign trajectories that are subtle in the time domain. UniGuard exceptional efficiency and effectiveness have been extensively validated across various modalities (image, text, and audio) and tasks (classification and regression), ranging from diverse model architectures against a wide range of AE attacks and backdoor attacks, including challenging partial backdoors and dynamic triggers. When compared to SOTA methods, including ContraNet (NDSS 22) specific for AE detection and TED (IEEE SP 24) specific for backdoor detection, UniGuard consistently demonstrates superior performance, even when matched against each method's strengths in addressing their respective threats-each SOTA fails to parts of attack strategies while UniGuard succeeds for all.</p></details> |  |
| **[EXPRTS: Exploring and Probing the Robustness of Time Series Forecasting Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03508v3)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When deploying time series forecasting models based on machine learning to real world settings, one often encounter situations where the data distribution drifts. Such drifts expose the forecasting models to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and machine learning models lack robustness in these settings. Robustness can be improved by using deep generative models or genetic algorithms to augment time series datasets, but these approaches lack interpretability and are computationally expensive. In this work, we develop an interpretable and simple framework for generating time series. Our method combines time-series decompositions with analytic functions, and is able to generate time series with characteristics matching both in- and out-of-distribution data. This approach allows users to generate new time series in an interpretable fashion, which can be used to augment the dataset and improve forecasting robustness. We demonstrate our framework through EXPRTS, a visual analytics tool designed for univariate time series forecasting models and datasets. Different visualizations of the data distribution, forecasting errors and single time series instances enable users to explore time series datasets, apply transformations, and evaluate forecasting model robustness across diverse scenarios. We show how our framework can generate meaningful OOD time series that improve model robustness, and we validate EXPRTS effectiveness and usability through three use-cases and a user study.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Multi-View Contrastive Learning for Robust Domain Adaptation in Medical Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22393v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting machine learning models to medical time series across different domains remains a challenge due to complex temporal dependencies and dynamic distribution shifts. Current approaches often focus on isolated feature representations, limiting their ability to fully capture the intricate temporal dynamics necessary for robust domain adaptation. In this work, we propose a novel framework leveraging multi-view contrastive learning to integrate temporal patterns, derivative-based dynamics, and frequency-domain features. Our method employs independent encoders and a hierarchical fusion mechanism to learn feature-invariant representations that are transferable across domains while preserving temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on diverse medical datasets, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and electromyography (EMG) demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in transfer learning tasks. By advancing the robustness and generalizability of machine learning models, our framework offers a practical pathway for deploying reliable AI systems in diverse healthcare settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Hypergraph Structure Learning with Diverse Smoothness Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03583v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In graph signal processing, learning the weighted connections between nodes from a set of sample signals is a fundamental task when the underlying relationships are not known a priori. This task is typically addressed by finding a graph Laplacian on which the observed signals are smooth. With the extension of graphs to hypergraphs - where edges can connect more than two nodes - graph learning methods have similarly been generalized to hypergraphs. However, the absence of a unified framework for calculating total variation has led to divergent definitions of smoothness and, consequently, differing approaches to hyperedge recovery. We confront this challenge through generalization of several previously proposed hypergraph total variations, subsequently allowing ease of substitution into a vector based optimization. To this end, we propose a novel hypergraph learning method that recovers a hypergraph topology from time-series signals based on a smoothness prior. Our approach, designated as Hypergraph Structure Learning with Smoothness (HSLS), addresses key limitations in prior works, such as hyperedge selection and convergence issues, by formulating the problem as a convex optimization solved via a forward-backward-forward algorithm, ensuring guaranteed convergence. Additionally, we introduce a process that simultaneously limits the span of the hyperedge search and maintains a valid hyperedge selection set. In doing so, our method becomes scalable in increasingly complex network structures. The experimental results demonstrate improved performance, in terms of accuracy, over other state-of-the-art hypergraph inference methods; furthermore, we empirically show our method to be robust to total variation terms, biased towards global smoothness, and scalable to larger hypergraphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE for possible publication; Section I includes more applications, comparisons, and enumerated list of novel contributions; removed numerical analysis of TV terms in Section II, added more general discussion; updated Algorithm 1 and corresponding text; third experiment of Section V-C replaced with new experiment</p></details> |
| **[Robust quantum reservoir computers for forecasting chaotic dynamics: generalized synchronization and stability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22335v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that recurrent quantum reservoir computers (QRCs) and their recurrence-free architectures (RF-QRCs) are robust tools for learning and forecasting chaotic dynamics from time-series data. First, we formulate and interpret quantum reservoir computers as coupled dynamical systems, where the reservoir acts as a response system driven by training data; in other words, quantum reservoir computers are generalized-synchronization (GS) systems. Second, we show that quantum reservoir computers can learn chaotic dynamics and their invariant properties, such as Lyapunov spectra, attractor dimensions, and geometric properties such as the covariant Lyapunov vectors. This analysis is enabled by deriving the Jacobian of the quantum reservoir update. Third, by leveraging tools from generalized synchronization, we provide a method for designing robust quantum reservoir computers. We propose the criterion $GS=ESP$: GS implies the echo state property (ESP), and vice versa. We analytically show that RF-QRCs, by design, fulfill $GS=ESP$. Finally, we analyze the effect of simulated noise. We find that dissipation from noise enhances the robustness of quantum reservoir computers. Numerical verifications on systems of different dimensions support our conclusions. This work opens opportunities for designing robust quantum machines for chaotic time series forecasting on near-term quantum hardware.</p></details> | 28 pages, 12 figures |

Although data-driven models can be used to improve transfer decisions, existing models focus on describing players' historical progress, leaving their future performance unknown. Moreover, recent developments have called for the use of explainable models combined with uncertainty quantification of predictions. This paper assesses explainable machine learning models based on predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification methods for the prediction of the future development in quality and transfer value of professional football players. The predictive accuracy is studied by training the models to predict the quality and value of players one year ahead. This is carried out by training them on two data sets containing data-driven indicators describing the player quality and player value in historical settings. In general, the random forest model is found to be the most suitable model because it provides accurate predictions as well as an uncertainty quantification method that naturally arises from the bagging procedure of the random forest model. Additionally, this research shows that the development of player performance contains nonlinear patterns and interactions between variables, and that time series information can provide useful information for the modeling of player performance metrics. The resulting models can help football clubs make more informed, data-driven transfer decisions by forecasting player quality and transfer value.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The article itself is on the pages 1-31.

However, their design primarily targets real-valued series, limiting their ability to handle general forecasting tasks involving diverse and often heterogeneous covariates--such as categorical variables and multimodal data (e.g., images, text)--which are typically task-specific and difficult to leverage during pretraining. To address this gap, we propose Unified Covariate Adaptation (UniCA), a framework to bridge TSFMs with general covariate-aware forecasting. UniCA first performs covariate homogenization to transform heterogeneous covariates into high-level homogeneous series representations and then fuses them via a unified attention-based fusion mechanism. UniCA is compatible and universal for adaptation with both homogeneous and heterogeneous covariates, incorporating extra covariate information while preserving the generalization ability of TSFMs.Extensive experiments on multiple unimodal and multimodal covariate-aware forecasting benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of UniCA, highlighting the promise of covariate-aware TSFM adaptation in real-world forecasting scenarios. Codes are released on https://github.com/hanlu-nju/UniCA.</p></details> |  |
| **[GKNet: Graph Kalman Filtering and Model Inference via Model-based Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22004v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference tasks with time series over graphs are of importance in applications such as urban water networks, economics, and networked neuroscience. Addressing these tasks typically relies on identifying a computationally affordable model that jointly captures the graph-temporal patterns of the data. In this work, we propose a graph-aware state space model for graph time series, where both the latent state and the observation equation are parametric graph-induced models with a limited number of parameters that need to be learned. More specifically, we consider the state equation to follow a stochastic partial differential equation driven by noise over the graphs edges accounting not only for potential edge uncertainties but also for increasing the degrees of freedom in the latter in a tractable manner. The graph structure conditioning of the noise dispersion allows the state variable to deviate from the stochastic process in certain neighborhoods. The observation model is a sampled and graph-filtered version of the state capturing multi-hop neighboring influence. The goal is to learn the parameters in both state and observation models from the partially observed data for downstream tasks such as prediction and imputation. The model is inferred first through a maximum likelihood approach that provides theoretical tractability but is limited in expressivity and scalability. To improve on the latter, we use the state-space formulation to build a principled deep learning architecture that jointly learns the parameters and tracks the state in an end-to-end manner in the spirit of Kalman neural networks.</p></details> |  |

Modern applications often demand flexibility beyond classical parametric models, motivating non-parametric descriptions of the ACF. Bochner's Theorem guarantees that any positive spectral measure yields a valid ACF via the inverse Fourier transform; however, existing non-parametric approaches in the spectral domain rarely return closed-form expressions for the ACF itself. We develop a flexible, closed-form class of non-parametric ACFs by deriving the inverse Fourier transform of B-spline spectral bases with arbitrary degree and knot placement. This yields a general class of ACF with three key features: (i) it is provably dense, under an $L^1$ metric, in the space of weakly stationary, mean-square continuous ACFs with mild regularity conditions; (ii) it accommodates univariate, multivariate, and multidimensional processes; and (iii) it naturally supports non-separable structure without requiring explicit imposition. Jackson-type approximation bounds establish convergence rates, and empirical results on simulated and real-world data demonstrate accurate process recovery. The method provides a practical and theoretically grounded approach for constructing a non-parametric class of ACF.</p></details> | Submitted to JRSSB |
| **[A Deep Learning Algorithm Based on CNN-LSTM Framework for Predicting Cancer Drug Sales Volume](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21927v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the application potential of a deep learning model based on the CNN-LSTM framework in forecasting the sales volume of cancer drugs, with a focus on modeling complex time series data. As advancements in medical technology and cancer treatment continue, the demand for oncology medications is steadily increasing. Accurate forecasting of cancer drug sales plays a critical role in optimizing production planning, supply chain management, and healthcare policy formulation. The dataset used in this research comprises quarterly sales records of a specific cancer drug in Egypt from 2015 to 2024, including multidimensional information such as date, drug type, pharmaceutical company, price, sales volume, effectiveness, and drug classification. To improve prediction accuracy, a hybrid deep learning model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks is employed. The CNN component is responsible for extracting local temporal features from the sales data, while the LSTM component captures long-term dependencies and trends. Model performance is evaluated using two widely adopted metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The results demonstrate that the CNN-LSTM model performs well on the test set, achieving an MSE of 1.150 and an RMSE of 1.072, indicating its effectiveness in handling nonlinear and volatile sales data. This research provides theoretical and technical support for data-driven decision-making in pharmaceutical marketing and healthcare resource planning.</p></details> |  |

We introduce mTSBench, the largest benchmark to date for MTS-AD and unsupervised model selection, spanning 344 labeled time series across 19 datasets and 12 diverse application domains. mTSBench evaluates 24 anomaly detection methods, including large language model (LLM)-based detectors for multivariate time series, and systematically benchmarks unsupervised model selection techniques under standardized conditions. Consistent with prior findings, our results confirm that no single detector excels across datasets, underscoring the importance of model selection. However, even state-of-the-art selection methods remain far from optimal, revealing critical gaps. mTSBench provides a unified evaluation suite to enable rigorous, reproducible comparisons and catalyze future advances in adaptive anomaly detection and robust model selection.</p></details> |  |

However, the manual modeling of faulty behaviors often demands extensive domain expertise and produces models that are complex, error-prone, and difficult to interpret. To address this challenge, we present a novel unsupervised fault diagnosis methodology that integrates collective anomaly detection in multivariate time series, process mining, and stochastic simulation. Initially, collective anomalies are detected from low-level sensor data using multivariate time-series analysis. These anomalies are then transformed into structured event logs, enabling the discovery of interpretable process models through process mining. By incorporating timing distributions into the extracted Petri nets, the approach supports stochastic simulation of faulty behaviors, thereby enhancing root cause analysis and behavioral understanding. The methodology is validated using the Robotic Arm Dataset (RoAD), a widely recognized benchmark in smart manufacturing. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in modeling, simulating, and classifying faulty behaviors in CPSs. This enables the creation of comprehensive fault dictionaries that support predictive maintenance and the development of digital twins for industrial environments.</p></details> |  |

However, competing methodologies often face significant challenges, particularly in their reliance on extensive manual efforts for cloud-free data curation and limited adaptability to diverse global conditions. In this paper, we introduce PTAViT3D, a deep learning architecture specifically designed for processing three-dimensional time series of satellite imagery from either Sentinel-1 (S1) or Sentinel-2 (S2). Additionally, we present PTAViT3D-CA, an extension of the PTAViT3D model incorporating cross-attention mechanisms to fuse S1 and S2 datasets, enhancing robustness in cloud-contaminated scenarios. The proposed methods leverage spatio-temporal correlations through a memory-efficient 3D Vision Transformer architecture, facilitating accurate boundary delineation directly from raw, cloud-contaminated imagery. We comprehensively validate our models through extensive testing on various datasets, including Australia's ePaddocks - CSIRO's national agricultural field boundary product - alongside public benchmarks Fields-of-the-World, PASTIS, and AI4SmallFarms. Our results consistently demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, highlighting excellent global transferability and robustness.

Neuromorphic systems built on spiking neurons excel at processing time-series data efficiently through sparse, event-driven computation, consuming energy only upon input events. Quantum computing, on the other hand, leverages superposition and entanglement to explore feature spaces that are exponentially large in the number of qubits. Hybrid approaches combining these paradigms have begun to show potential, but existing quantum spiking models have important limitations. Notably, prior quantum spiking neuron implementations rely on classical memory mechanisms on single qubits, requiring repeated measurements to estimate firing probabilities, and they use conventional backpropagation on classical simulators for training. Here we propose a stochastic quantum spiking (SQS) neuron model that addresses these challenges. The SQS neuron uses multi-qubit quantum circuits to realize a spiking unit with internal quantum memory, enabling event-driven probabilistic spike generation in a single shot. Furthermore, we outline how networks of SQS neurons -- dubbed SQS neural networks (SQSNNs) -- can be trained via a hardware-friendly local learning rule, eliminating the need for global classical backpropagation. The proposed SQSNN model fuses the time-series efficiency of neuromorphic computing with the exponentially large inner state space of quantum computing, paving the way for quantum spiking neural networks that are modular, scalable, and trainable on quantum hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[Linear scaling causal discovery from high-dimensional time series by dynamical community detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10886v2)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding which parts of a dynamical system cause each other is extremely relevant in fundamental and applied sciences. However, inferring causal links from observational data, namely without direct manipulations of the system, is still computationally challenging, especially if the data are high-dimensional. In this study we introduce a framework for constructing causal graphs from high-dimensional time series, whose computational cost scales linearly with the number of variables. The approach is based on the automatic identification of dynamical communities, groups of variables which mutually influence each other and can therefore be described as a single node in a causal graph. These communities are efficiently identified by optimizing the Information Imbalance, a statistical quantity that assigns a weight to each putative causal variable based on its information content relative to a target variable. The communities are then ordered starting from the fully autonomous ones, whose evolution is independent from all the others, to those that are progressively dependent on other communities, building in this manner a community causal graph. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and the accuracy of our approach on time-discrete and time-continuous dynamical systems including up to 80 variables.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Minimizing Wiggle in Stacked Area Charts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21175v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stacked area charts are a widely used visualization technique for numerical time series. The x-axis represents time, and the time series are displayed as horizontal, variable-height layers stacked on top of each other. The height of each layer corresponds to the time series values at each time point. The main aesthetic criterion for optimizing the readability of stacked area charts is the amount of vertical change of the borders between the time series in the visualization, called wiggle. While many heuristic algorithms have been developed to minimize wiggle, the computational complexity of minimizing wiggle has not been formally analyzed. In this paper, we show that different variants of wiggle minimization are NP-hard and even hard to approximate. We also present an exact mixed-integer linear programming formulation and compare its performance with a state-of-the-art heuristic in an experimental evaluation. Lastly, we consider a special case of wiggle minimization that corresponds to the fundamentally interesting and natural problem of ordering a set of numbers as to minimize their sum of absolute prefix sums. We show several complexity results for this problem that imply some of the mentioned hardness results for wiggle minimization.</p></details> | 19 pages, 3 figures |

A key novelty of our analysis are bounds for the distributional distance between the limit Brownian motion and the entire partial sum process in the function space. To measure the distance between distributions, we employ the Prokhorov and Wasserstein metrics. We show that these bounds have important probabilistic implications, including strong invariance principles and new couplings between the partial sums and their Gaussian limits. Our results are formulated for weakly dependent, nonstationary time series in the Banach space of d-dimensional, continuous functions. Mathematically, our approach rests on a new, two-step proof strategy: First, using entropy bounds from empirical process theory, we replace the function-valued partial sum process by a high-dimensional discretization. Second, using Gaussian approximations for weakly dependent, high-dimensional vectors, we obtain bounds on the distance. As a statistical application of our coupling results, we validate an open-ended monitoring scheme for sparse functional data. Existing probabilistic tools were not appropriate for this task.</p></details> |  |

However, training Latent SDEs typically relies on adjoint sensitivity methods, which depend on simulation and backpropagation through approximate SDE solutions, which limit scalability. In this work, we propose SDE Matching, a new simulation-free method for training Latent SDEs. Inspired by modern Score- and Flow Matching algorithms for learning generative dynamics, we extend these ideas to the domain of stochastic dynamics for time series and sequence modeling, eliminating the need for costly numerical simulations. Our results demonstrate that SDE Matching achieves performance comparable to adjoint sensitivity methods while drastically reducing computational complexity.</p></details> |  |

It is difficult to estimate because it depends on latent variables such as new infections and other characteristics of an epidemic which have to be inferred from available data. In this paper, we present new statistical methods for a popular model which defines the effective reproduction number based on self-exciting dynamics of new infections. Such a model is conceptually simple and less susceptible to misspecifications than more complicated multi-compartment models. In contrast to the state-of-the-art three-step estimation procedure of \citet{huisman2022estimation}, we present a coherent Bayesian method that approximates the joint posterior of daily new infections and reproduction numbers given the data using a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Comparing our method with that of \citet{huisman2022estimation}, both with daily confirmed cases from Switzerland in the Covid-19 epidemic and with simulated data, we find that our method is more accurate, especially near the beginning and end of the observation period.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangling network dependence among multiple variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20974v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When two variables depend on the same or similar underlying network, their shared network dependence structure can lead to spurious associations. While statistical associations between two variables sampled from interconnected subjects are a common inferential goal across various fields, little research has focused on how to disentangle shared dependence for valid statistical inference. We revisit two different approaches from distinct fields that may address shared network dependence: the pre-whitening approach, commonly used in time series analysis to remove the shared temporal dependence, and the network autocorrelation model, widely used in network analysis often to examine or account for autocorrelation of the outcome variable. We demonstrate how each approach implicitly entails assumptions about how a variable of interest propagates among nodes via network ties given the network structure. We further propose adaptations of existing pre-whitening methods to the network setting by explicitly reflecting underlying assumptions about "level of interaction" that induce network dependence, while accounting for its unique complexities. Our simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the two approaches in reducing spurious associations due to shared network dependence when their respective assumptions hold. However, the results also show the sensitivity to assumption violations, underscoring the importance of correctly specifying the shared dependence structure based on available network information and prior knowledge about the interactions driving dependence.</p></details> |  |
| **[FINN-GL: Generalized Mixed-Precision Extensions for FPGA-Accelerated LSTMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20810v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly LSTMs, are effective for time-series tasks like sentiment analysis and short-term stock prediction. However, their computational complexity poses challenges for real-time deployment in resource constrained environments. While FPGAs offer a promising platform for energy-efficient AI acceleration, existing tools mainly target feed-forward networks, and LSTM acceleration typically requires full custom implementation. In this paper, we address this gap by leveraging the open-source and extensible FINN framework to enable the generalized deployment of LSTMs on FPGAs. Specifically, we leverage the Scan operator from the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) specification to model the recurrent nature of LSTM computations, enabling support for mixed quantisation within them and functional verification of LSTM-based models. Furthermore, we introduce custom transformations within the FINN compiler to map the quantised ONNX computation graph to hardware blocks from the HLS kernel library of the FINN compiler and Vitis HLS. We validate the proposed tool-flow by training a quantised ConvLSTM model for a mid-price stock prediction task using the widely used dataset and generating a corresponding hardware IP of the model using our flow, targeting the XCZU7EV device. We show that the generated quantised ConvLSTM accelerator through our flow achieves a balance between performance (latency) and resource consumption, while matching (or bettering) inference accuracy of state-of-the-art models with reduced precision. We believe that the generalisable nature of the proposed flow will pave the way for resource-efficient RNN accelerator designs on FPGAs.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables, Accepted for publication in IEEE FPL-2025 (https://2025.fpl.org/)</p></details> |

A much less studied problem, motivated by questions that are ubiquitous in extreme value theory, is the asymptotic behavior of such partial sums when the subordination mechanism has a threshold depending on sample size, so as to focus on the right tail of the time series. This article substantially extends longstanding asymptotic techniques by allowing the subordination mechanism to depend on the sample size in this way and to grow at a polynomial rate, while permitting the innovation process to have infinite variance. The cornerstone of our theoretical approach is a tailored $L^r(\mathbf{P})$ reduction principle, which enables the use of classical results on partial sums of long memory linear processes. In this way we obtain asymptotic theory for certain Peaks-over-Threshold estimators with deterministic or random thresholds. Applications comprise both the heavy- and light-tailed regimes -- yielding unexpected results which, to the best of our knowledge, are new to the literature.</p></details> | 52 pages, 1 figure |

Accurately identifying when unexpected errors or faults occur is essential, yet challenging, due to the unknown nature of anomalies and the complex interdependencies between time series dimensions. In this paper, we investigate transformer-based approaches for time series anomaly detection, focusing on the recently proposed iTransformer architecture. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) we explore the application of the iTransformer to time series anomaly detection, and analyse the influence of key parameters such as window size, step size, and model dimensions on performance; (ii) we examine methods for extracting anomaly labels from multidimensional anomaly scores and discuss appropriate evaluation metrics for such labels; (iii) we study the impact of anomalous data present during training and assess the effectiveness of alternative loss functions in mitigating their influence; and (iv) we present a comprehensive comparison of several transformer-based models across a diverse set of datasets for time series anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to VLDB 2026 conference, currently under review</p></details> |

However, existing tools for measuring and reporting such impacts are often fragmented, lacking systematic metric integration and offering limited support for correlation analysis among them. This paper presents WattsOnAI, a comprehensive software toolkit for the measurement, analysis, and visualization of energy use, power draw, hardware performance, and carbon emissions across AI workloads. By seamlessly integrating with existing AI frameworks, WattsOnAI offers standardized reports and exports fine-grained time-series data to support benchmarking and reproducibility in a lightweight manner. It further enables in-depth correlation analysis between hardware metrics and model performance and thus facilitates bottleneck identification and performance enhancement.

In e-commerce recommendations, for instance, our goal is often to estimate and optimize the policy value for the upcoming month using data collected by an old policy in the previous month. A critical challenge is that data related to the future environment is not observed in the historical data. Existing methods assume stationarity or depend on restrictive reward-modeling assumptions, leading to significant bias. To address these limitations, we propose a novel estimator named \textit{\textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy Estimator for the \textbf{F}uture \textbf{V}alue (\textbf{\textit{OPFV}})}, designed for accurately estimating policy values at any future time point. The key feature of OPFV is its ability to leverage the useful structure within time-series data. While future data might not be present in the historical log, we can leverage, for example, seasonal, weekly, or holiday effects that are consistent in both the historical and future data. Our estimator is the first to exploit these time-related structures via a new type of importance weighting, enabling effective F-OPE. Theoretical analysis identifies the conditions under which OPFV becomes low-bias. In addition, we extend our estimator to develop a new policy-gradient method to proactively learn a good future policy using only historical data. Empirical results show that our methods substantially outperform existing methods in estimating and optimizing the future policy value under non-stationarity for various experimental setups.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Visualization Framework for Exploring Multi-Agent-Based Simulations Case Study of an Electric Vehicle Home Charging Ecosystem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20400v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent-based simulations (MABS) of electric vehicle (EV) home charging ecosystems generate large, complex, and stochastic time-series datasets that capture interactions between households, grid infrastructure, and energy markets. These interactions can lead to unexpected system-level events, such as transformer overloads or consumer dissatisfaction, that are difficult to detect and explain through static post-processing. This paper presents a modular, Python-based dashboard framework, built using Dash by Plotly, that enables efficient, multi-level exploration and root-cause analysis of emergent behavior in MABS outputs. The system features three coordinated views (System Overview, System Analysis, and Consumer Analysis), each offering high-resolution visualizations such as time-series plots, spatial heatmaps, and agent-specific drill-down tools. A case study simulating full EV adoption with smart charging in a Danish residential network demonstrates how the dashboard supports rapid identification and contextual explanation of anomalies, including clustered transformer overloads and time-dependent charging failures. The framework facilitates actionable insight generation for researchers and distribution system operators, and its architecture is adaptable to other distributed energy resources and complex energy systems.</p></details> |  |

We present TESSERA, a novel Remote Sensing Foundation Model (RSFM) that uses Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) to generate global, robust representations at 10m scale from pixel-level satellite time series data. TESSERA combines information from only optical and SAR data streams using two parallel Transformer-based encoders: one dedicated to Sentinel-1 SAR polarizations and another to Sentinel-2 MSI data (10 selected spectral bands) to create representations that are then fused using a multilayer perceptron (MLP), resulting in a global representation map covering the years 2017 to 2024. Our precomputed representations set a new state-of-the-art performance benchmark and our open-source approach democratizes access to high-performance, high-resolution representations. We benchmark the performance of TESSERA in five diverse tasks, comparing our work with state-of-the-art task-specific models and other foundation models. Our results show that TESSERA outperforms both traditional RS baselines and the leading geospatial foundation models in these diverse downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A foundation model with multi-variate parallel attention to generate neuronal activity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20354v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from multi-variate time-series with heterogeneous channel configurations remains a fundamental challenge for deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly in clinical domains such as intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), where channel setups vary widely across subjects. In this work, we introduce multi-variate parallel attention (MVPA), a novel self-attention mechanism that disentangles content, temporal, and spatial attention, enabling flexible, generalizable, and efficient modeling of time-series data with varying channel counts and configurations. We use MVPA to build MVPFormer, a generative foundation model for human electrophysiology, trained to predict the evolution of iEEG signals across diverse subjects. To support this and future effort by the community, we release the SWEC iEEG dataset, the largest publicly available iEEG dataset to date, comprising nearly 10,000 hours of recordings from heterogeneous clinical sources. MVPFormer leverages MVPA to achieve strong generalization across subjects, demonstrating expert-level performance in seizure detection and outperforming state-of-the-art Transformer baselines on our SWEC, the MAYO, and the FNUSA dataset. We further validate MVPA on standard time-series forecasting and classification tasks, where it matches or exceeds existing attention-based models. Together, our contributions establish MVPA as a general-purpose attention mechanism for heterogeneous time-series and MVPFormer as the first open-source, open-weights, and open-data iEEG foundation model with state-of-the-art clinical performance.

| **[On the ability of Deep Neural Networks to Learn Granger Causality in Multi-Variate Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20347v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Granger Causality (GC) offers an elegant statistical framework to study the association between multivariate time series data. Linear Vector Autoregressive models (VAR) though have nice interpretation properties but have limited practical application due to underlying assumptions on the kind of associations that can be captured by these models. Numerous attempts have already been made in the literature that exploit the functional approximation power of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for the task of GC estimation. These methods however treat GC as a variable selection problem. We present a novel paradigm for approaching GC. We present this idea that GC is essentially linked with prediction and if a deep learning model is used to model the time series collectively or jointly, a well regularized model may learn the true granger causal structure from the data, given that there is enough training data. We propose to uncover the learned GC structure by comparing the model uncertainty or distribution of the residuals when the past of everything is used as compared to the one where a specific time series component is dropped from the model. We also compare the effect of input layer dropout on the ability of a neural network to learn granger causality from the data. We show that a well regularized model infact can learn the true GC structure from the data without explicitly adding terms in the loss function that guide the model to select variables or perform sparse regression.</p></details> |  |

However, most studies concentrate on short-term forecasting of generation or consumption with a focus on systems and less on individual consumers. Even more neglected is the topic of long-term forecasting of individual power consumption. Here, we provide an in-depth comparative evaluation of data-driven methods for generating synthetic time series data tailored to energy consumption long-term forecasting. High-fidelity synthetic data is crucial for a wide range of applications, including state estimations in energy systems or power grid planning. In this study, we assess and compare the performance of multiple state-of-the-art but less common techniques: a hybrid Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN), Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and Masked Autoregressive Bernstein polynomial normalizing Flows (MABF). We analyze the ability of each method to replicate the temporal dynamics, long-range dependencies, and probabilistic transitions characteristic of individual energy consumption profiles. Our comparative evaluation highlights the strengths and limitations of: WGAN, DDPM, HMM and MABF aiding in selecting the most suitable approach for state estimations and other energy-related tasks. Our generation and analysis framework aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of synthetic power consumption data while generating data that fulfills criteria like anonymisation - preserving privacy concerns mitigating risks of specific profiling of single customers. This study utilizes an open-source dataset from households in Germany with 15min time resolution. The generated synthetic power profiles can readily be used in applications like state estimations or consumption forecasting.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we introduce a novel multi-scale time series reshape module, which effectively captures the relationships among multi-period patches and variable dependencies. Building upon this module, we propose MS-TVNet, a multi-scale 3D dynamic convolutional neural network. Through comprehensive evaluations on diverse datasets, MS-TVNet demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline models, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in long-term time series prediction. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of leveraging convolutional networks for capturing complex temporal patterns, suggesting a promising direction for future research in this field.The code is realsed on https://github.com/Curyyfaust/TVNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[SEED: A Structural Encoder for Embedding-Driven Decoding in Time Series Prediction with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20167v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting requires models to simultaneously capture variable-wise structural dependencies and generalize across diverse tasks. While structural encoders are effective in modeling feature interactions, they lack the capacity to support semantic-level reasoning or task adaptation. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) possess strong generalization capabilities but remain incompatible with raw time series inputs. This gap limits the development of unified, transferable prediction systems. Therefore, we introduce SEED, a structural encoder for embedding-driven decoding, which integrates four stages: a token-aware encoder for patch extraction, a projection module that aligns patches with language model embeddings, a semantic reprogramming mechanism that maps patches to task-aware prototypes, and a frozen language model for prediction. This modular architecture decouples representation learning from inference, enabling efficient alignment between numerical patterns and semantic reasoning. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent improvements over strong baselines, and comparative studies on various datasets confirm SEED's role in addressing the structural-semantic modeling gap.</p></details> |  |

We show that early bed-exit intent can be predicted using only four low-cost load cells mounted under the bed legs. The resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps - recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field - that expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights. To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC. The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time, privacy-preserving fall prevention.</p></details> |  |
| **[TSPulse: Dual Space Tiny Pre-Trained Models for Rapid Time-Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13033v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of time-series pre-trained models has advanced temporal representation learning, but current state-of-the-art models are often large-scale, requiring substantial compute. We introduce TSPulse, ultra-compact time-series pre-trained models with only 1M parameters, specialized to perform strongly across classification, anomaly detection, imputation, and retrieval tasks. TSPulse introduces innovations at both the architecture and task levels. At the architecture level, it employs a dual-space masked reconstruction, learning from both time and frequency domains to capture complementary signals. This is further enhanced by a dual-embedding disentanglement, generating both detailed embeddings for fine-grained analysis and high-level semantic embeddings for broader task understanding. Notably, TSPulse's semantic embeddings are robust to shifts in time, magnitude, and noise, which is important for robust retrieval. At the task level, TSPulse incorporates TSLens, a fine-tuning component enabling task-specific feature attention. It also introduces a multi-head triangulation technique that correlates deviations from multiple prediction heads, enhancing anomaly detection by fusing complementary model outputs. Additionally, a hybrid mask pretraining is proposed to improves zero-shot imputation by reducing pre-training bias. These architecture and task innovations collectively contribute to TSPulse's significant performance gains: 5-16% on the UEA classification benchmarks, +20% on the TSB-AD anomaly detection leaderboard, +50% in zero-shot imputation, and +25% in time-series retrieval. Remarkably, these results are achieved with just 1M parameters (10-100X smaller than existing SOTA models) and allow GPU-free inference, setting a new standard for efficient time-series pre-trained models.

However, effectively integrating these high-dimensional temporal signals with natural language for dynamic, interactive tasks remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce the Time-Series Question Answering (Time-Series QA) task and release EngineMT-QA, the first large-scale, multi-task, temporal-textual QA dataset designed to capture complex interactions between time-series signals and natural language. Building on this resource, we propose the Instruct Time Transformer (ITFormer), a novel framework that bridges time-series encoders with frozen large language models (LLMs). ITFormer effectively extracts, aligns, and fuses temporal and textual features, achieving a strong improvement in QA accuracy over strong baselines with fewer than 1\% additional trainable parameters. By combining computational efficiency with robust cross-modal modeling, our work establishes a adaptable paradigm for integrating temporal data with natural language, paving the way for new research and applications in multi-modal AI.

However, in real-world infrastructure monitoring, practitioners often encounter datasets where large amounts of data are missing and follow complex, heterogeneous patterns. We introduce DIM-SUM, a preprocessing framework for training robust imputation models that bridges the gap between artificially masked training data and real missing patterns. DIM-SUM combines pattern clustering and adaptive masking strategies with theoretical learning guarantees to handle diverse missing patterns actually observed in the data. Through extensive experiments on over 2 billion readings from California water districts, electricity datasets, and benchmarks, we demonstrate that DIM-SUM outperforms traditional methods by reaching similar accuracy with lower processing time and significantly less training data. When compared against a large pre-trained model, DIM-SUM averages 2x higher accuracy with significantly less inference time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neuromorphic Wireless Split Computing with Resonate-and-Fire Neurons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20015v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuromorphic computing offers an energy-efficient alternative to conventional deep learning accelerators for real-time time-series processing. However, many edge applications, such as wireless sensing and audio recognition, generate streaming signals with rich spectral features that are not effectively captured by conventional leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) spiking neurons. This paper investigates a wireless split computing architecture that employs resonate-and-fire (RF) neurons with oscillatory dynamics to process time-domain signals directly, eliminating the need for costly spectral pre-processing. By resonating at tunable frequencies, RF neurons extract time-localized spectral features while maintaining low spiking activity. This temporal sparsity translates into significant savings in both computation and transmission energy. Assuming an OFDM-based analog wireless interface for spike transmission, we present a complete system design and evaluate its performance on audio classification and modulation classification tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed RF-SNN architecture achieves comparable accuracy to conventional LIF-SNNs and ANNs, while substantially reducing spike rates and total energy consumption during inference and communication.</p></details> |  |

Rooted in rough path theory, path signatures are invariant to reparameterization and well-suited for modelling evolving dynamics, long-range dependencies, and irregular sampling - common challenges in real-world time series and graph data. This thesis investigates how to harness the expressive power of path signatures within scalable machine learning pipelines. It introduces a suite of models that combine theoretical robustness with computational efficiency, bridging rough path theory with probabilistic modelling, deep learning, and kernel methods. Key contributions include: Gaussian processes with signature kernel-based covariance functions for uncertainty-aware time series modelling; the Seq2Tens framework, which employs low-rank tensor structure in the weight space for scalable deep modelling of long-range dependencies; and graph-based models where expected signatures over graphs induce hypo-elliptic diffusion processes, offering expressive yet tractable alternatives to standard graph neural networks. Further developments include Random Fourier Signature Features, a scalable kernel approximation with theoretical guarantees, and Recurrent Sparse Spectrum Signature Gaussian Processes, which combine Gaussian processes, signature kernels, and random features with a principled forgetting mechanism for multi-horizon time series forecasting with adaptive context length. We hope this thesis serves as both a methodological toolkit and a conceptual bridge, and provides a useful reference for the current state of the art in scalable, signature-based learning for sequential and structured data.</p></details> | PhD thesis |

However, existing approaches predominantly focus on model heterogeneity and aggregation techniques, largely overlooking the fundamental impact of dataset size characteristics on federated training dynamics. This paper introduces Size-Based Adaptive Federated Learning (SAFL), a novel progressive training framework that systematically organizes federated learning based on dataset size characteristics across heterogeneous multi-modal data. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation across 13 diverse datasets spanning 7 modalities (vision, text, time series, audio, sensor, medical vision, and multimodal) reveals critical insights: 1) an optimal dataset size range of 1000-1500 samples for federated learning effectiveness; 2) a clear modality performance hierarchy with structured data (time series, sensor) significantly outperforming unstructured data (text, multimodal); and 3) systematic performance degradation for large datasets exceeding 2000 samples. SAFL achieves an average accuracy of 87.68% across all datasets, with structured data modalities reaching 99%+ accuracy. The framework demonstrates superior communication efficiency, reducing total data transfer to 7.38 GB across 558 communications while maintaining high performance. Our real-time monitoring framework provides unprecedented insights into system resource utilization, network efficiency, and training dynamics. This work fills critical gaps in understanding how data characteristics should drive federated learning strategies, providing both theoretical insights and practical guidance for real-world FL deployments in neural network and learning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Dynamic Factor Modeling via Manifold Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19945v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a data-driven dynamic factor framework where a response variable depends on a high-dimensional set of covariates, without imposing any parametric model on the joint dynamics. Leveraging Anisotropic Diffusion Maps, a nonlinear manifold learning technique introduced by Singer and Coifman, our framework uncovers the joint dynamics of the covariates and responses in a purely data-driven way. We approximate the embedding dynamics using linear diffusions, and exploit Kalman filtering to predict the evolution of the covariates and response variables directly from the diffusion map embedding space. We generalize Singer's convergence rate analysis of the graph Laplacian from the case of independent uniform samples on a compact manifold to the case of time series arising from Langevin diffusions in Euclidean space. Furthermore, we provide rigorous justification for our procedure by showing the robustness of approximations of the diffusion map coordinates by linear diffusions, and the convergence of ergodic averages under standard spectral assumptions on the underlying dynamics. We apply our method to the stress testing of equity portfolios using a combination of financial and macroeconomic factors from the Federal Reserve's supervisory scenarios. We demonstrate that our data-driven stress testing method outperforms standard scenario analysis and Principal Component Analysis benchmarks through historical backtests spanning three major financial crises, achieving reductions in mean absolute error of up to 55% and 39% for scenario-based portfolio return prediction, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Multi-sensor Fusion Perception for Embodied AI: Background, Methods, Challenges and Prospects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19769v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-sensor fusion perception (MSFP) is a key technology for embodied AI, which can serve a variety of downstream tasks (e.g., 3D object detection and semantic segmentation) and application scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving and swarm robotics). Recently, impressive achievements on AI-based MSFP methods have been reviewed in relevant surveys. However, we observe that the existing surveys have some limitations after a rigorous and detailed investigation. For one thing, most surveys are oriented to a single task or research field, such as 3D object detection or autonomous driving. Therefore, researchers in other related tasks often find it difficult to benefit directly. For another, most surveys only introduce MSFP from a single perspective of multi-modal fusion, while lacking consideration of the diversity of MSFP methods, such as multi-view fusion and time-series fusion. To this end, in this paper, we hope to organize MSFP research from a task-agnostic perspective, where methods are reported from various technical views. Specifically, we first introduce the background of MSFP. Next, we review multi-modal and multi-agent fusion methods. A step further, time-series fusion methods are analyzed. In the era of LLM, we also investigate multimodal LLM fusion methods. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions for MSFP. We hope this survey can help researchers understand the important progress in MSFP and provide possible insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

Google Trends offers a rich proxy for public interest, yet the high dimensionality and noise of its time-series data present challenges for effective clustering. This study evaluates three unsupervised clustering approaches, Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX), enhanced SAX (eSAX), and Topological Data Analysis (TDA), applied to 20 Google Trends keywords representing major consumer categories. Our results show that while SAX and eSAX offer fast and interpretable clustering for stable time series, they struggle with volatility and complexity, often producing ambiguous ``catch-all'' clusters. TDA, by contrast, captures global structural features through persistent homology and achieves more balanced and meaningful groupings. We conclude with practical guidance for using symbolic and topological methods in consumer analytics and suggest that hybrid approaches combining both perspectives hold strong potential for future applications.</p></details> | 33 pages, 30 figures |

Here, we propose a new hierarchical architecture that tackles this problem by leveraging modules that specialize in forecasting the different temporal aggregation levels of interest. The architecture, which learns to encode the average behaviour of the target variable within its hidden layers, makes accurate and coherent forecasts across the target temporal hierarchies. We validate our architecture on the challenging, real-world M5 dataset and show that it outperforms established methods, such as the TSMixer model.</p></details> |  |

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, which is not affected by cloud interference, offers a complementary solution, but lack sufficient spectral detail for precise crop mapping. To address this, we propose a novel framework, Time-series MSI Image Reconstruction using Vision Transformer (ViT), to reconstruct MSI data in cloud-covered regions by leveraging the temporal coherence of MSI and the complementary information from SAR from the attention mechanism. Comprehensive experiments, using rigorous reconstruction evaluation metrics, demonstrate that Time-series ViT framework significantly outperforms baselines that use non-time-series MSI and SAR or time-series MSI without SAR, effectively enhancing MSI image reconstruction in cloud-covered regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a conference paper at the 2025 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)</p></details> |
| **[Towards an Introspective Dynamic Model of Globally Distributed Computing Infrastructures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19578v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale scientific collaborations like ATLAS, Belle II, CMS, DUNE, and others involve hundreds of research institutes and thousands of researchers spread across the globe. These experiments generate petabytes of data, with volumes soon expected to reach exabytes. Consequently, there is a growing need for computation, including structured data processing from raw data to consumer-ready derived data, extensive Monte Carlo simulation campaigns, and a wide range of end-user analysis. To manage these computational and storage demands, centralized workflow and data management systems are implemented. However, decisions regarding data placement and payload allocation are often made disjointly and via heuristic means. A significant obstacle in adopting more effective heuristic or AI-driven solutions is the absence of a quick and reliable introspective dynamic model to evaluate and refine alternative approaches. In this study, we aim to develop such an interactive system using real-world data. By examining job execution records from the PanDA workflow management system, we have pinpointed key performance indicators such as queuing time, error rate, and the extent of remote data access. The dataset includes five months of activity. Additionally, we are creating a generative AI model to simulate time series of payloads, which incorporate visible features like category, event count, and submitting group, as well as hidden features like the total computational load-derived from existing PanDA records and computing site capabilities. These hidden features, which are not visible to job allocators, whether heuristic or AI-driven, influence factors such as queuing times and data movement.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional time series forecasting methods suffer from insufficient historical data, which stems from a disregard for the generalized and specific features among different tasks. For the aforementioned challenges, we propose the Feature-Adaptive Time Series Forecasting Framework (FAF), which consists of three key components: the Generalized Knowledge Module (GKM), the Task-Specific Module (TSM), and the Rank Module (RM). During training phase, the GKM is updated through a meta-learning mechanism that enables the model to extract generalized features across related tasks. Meanwhile, the TSM is trained to capture diverse local dynamics through multiple functional regions, each of which learns specific features from individual tasks. During testing phase, the RM dynamically selects the most relevant functional region from the TSM based on input sequence features, which is then combined with the generalized knowledge learned by the GKM to generate accurate forecasts. This design enables FAF to achieve robust and personalized forecasting even with sparse historical observations We evaluate FAF on five diverse real-world datasets under few-shot time series forecasting settings. Experimental results demonstrate that FAF consistently outperforms baselines that include three categories of time series forecasting methods. In particular, FAF achieves a 41.81\% improvement over the best baseline, iTransformer, on the CO$_2$ emissions dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages,4 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[ZK-SERIES: Privacy-Preserving Authentication using Temporal Biometric Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19393v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biometric authentication relies on physiological or behavioral traits that are inherent to a user, making them difficult to lose, forge or forget. Biometric data with a temporal component enable the following authentication protocol: recent readings of the underlying biometrics are encoded as time series and compared to a set of base readings. If the distance between the new readings and the base readings falls within an acceptable threshold, then the user is successfully authenticated. Various methods exist for comparing time series data, such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and the Time Warp Edit Distance (TWED), each offering advantages and drawbacks depending on the context. Moreover, many of these techniques do not inherently preserve privacy, which is a critical consideration in biometric authentication due to the complexity of resetting biometric credentials. In this work, we propose ZK-SERIES to provide privacy and efficiency to a broad spectrum of time series-based authentication protocols. ZK-SERIES uses the same building blocks, i.e., zero-knowledge multiplication proofs and efficiently batched range proofs, to ensure consistency across all protocols. Furthermore, it is optimized for compatibility with low-capacity devices such as smartphones. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed technique, we primarily focus on two case studies for biometric authentication: shake-based and blow-based authentication. To demonstrate ZK-SERIES's practical applicability even in older and less powerful smartphones, we conduct experiments on a 5-year-old low-spec smartphone using real data for two case studies alongside scalability assessments using artificial data. Our experimental results indicate that the privacy-preserving authentication protocol can be completed within 1.3 seconds on older devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Cross-Modal Learning for Infusing Chest X-ray Knowledge into ECGs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19329v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern diagnostic workflows are increasingly multimodal, integrating diverse data sources such as medical images, structured records, and physiological time series. Among these, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and chest X-rays (CXRs) are two of the most widely used modalities for cardiac assessment. While CXRs provide rich diagnostic information, ECGs are more accessible and can support scalable early warning systems. In this work, we propose CroMoTEX, a novel contrastive learning-based framework that leverages chest X-rays during training to learn clinically informative ECG representations for multiple cardiac-related pathologies: cardiomegaly, pleural effusion, and edema. Our method aligns ECG and CXR representations using a novel supervised cross-modal contrastive objective with adaptive hard negative weighting, enabling robust and task-relevant feature learning. At test time, CroMoTEX relies solely on ECG input, allowing scalable deployment in real-world settings where CXRs may be unavailable. Evaluated on the large-scale MIMIC-IV-ECG and MIMIC-CXR datasets, CroMoTEX outperforms baselines across all three pathologies, achieving up to 78.31 AUROC on edema. Our code is available at github.com/vineetpmoorty/cromotex.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlightKooba: A Fast Interpretable FTP Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19885v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Koopman theory is a powerful and effective modeling tool for converting nonlinear systems into linear representations, and flight trajectory prediction (FTP) is a complex nonlinear system. However, current models applying the Koopman theory to FTP tasks are not very effective, model interpretability is indeed an issue, and the Koopman operators are computationally intensive, resulting in long training times. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new modeling and control framework based on the HIPPO method, the Koopman theory, and state space equations from cybernetics: FlightKooba. Inspired by the idea of structural state space equations, FlightKooba directly constructs the Koopman operators from data. This makes the framework highly interpretable and significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters in the module, thereby greatly reducing training time. Experiments have demonstrated the superiority of the FlightKooba modeling method in terms of time and memory consumption (training time comparable to the Mamba module without using CUDA-level acceleration; memory reduced by more than 50% on most datasets, with a tenfold reduction in the number of parameters), essentially completing the FTP task. It provides a new method for the fast computation of the Koopman operators, opening up new possibilities for the combination of time series forecasting and control.</p></details> | 7 figures |
| **[Time-IMM: A Dataset and Benchmark for Irregular Multimodal Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10412v2)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However, existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data, creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based, constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation. IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blacksnail789521/time-imm/data, and the benchmark library can be accessed at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IMMTSF_NeurIPS2025.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |

TabPFN has recently demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional machine learning (ML) models in various regression and classification tasks. We used the dekadal (10-days) time series of Earth Observation (EO; FAPAR and soil moisture) and gridded weather data (air temperature, precipitation and radiation) to forecast the yield of summer crops at the sub-national level. The crop yield data was available for 23 years and for up to 8 provinces. Covariate variables for TabPFN (i.e., EO and weather) were extracted by region and aggregated at a monthly scale. We benchmarked the results of the TabPFN against six ML models and three baseline models. Leave-one-year-out cross-validation experiment setting was used in order to ensure the assessment of the models capacity to forecast an unseen year. Results showed that TabPFN and ML models exhibit comparable accuracy, outperforming the baselines. Nonetheless, TabPFN demonstrated superior practical utility due to its significantly faster tuning time and reduced requirement for feature engineering. This renders TabPFN a more viable option for real-world operation yield forecasting applications, where efficiency and ease of implementation are paramount.</p></details> |  |

However, common interpretability algorithms face unique challenges when applied to dynamic prediction tasks, where patient trajectories evolve over time. Gradient, Occlusion, and Permutation-based methods often struggle with time-varying target dependency and temporal smoothness. This work systematically analyzes these failure modes and supports learnable mask-based interpretability frameworks as alternatives, which can incorporate temporal continuity and label consistency constraints to learn feature importance over time. Here, we propose that learnable mask-based approaches for dynamic timeseries prediction problems provide more reliable and consistent interpretations for applications in critical care and similar domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, Accepted at the AMIA Annual Symposium 2025.

The state-of-the-art optimal control approaches often rely on numerical methods sensitive to initial guesses. This paper presents an innovative collision-free finite-time formation control scheme for multiple UAVs leveraging the differential flatness of the UAV dynamics, eliminating the need for numerical methods. We formulate a finite-time optimal control problem to plan a formation trajectory for feasible initial states. This optimal control problem in formation trajectory planning involves a collective performance index to meet the formation requirements to achieve relative positions and velocity consensus. It is solved by applying Pontryagin's principle. Subsequently, a collision-constrained regulating problem is addressed to ensure collision-free tracking of the planned formation trajectory. The tracking problem incorporates a directionally aware collision avoidance strategy that prioritizes avoiding UAVs in the forward path and relative approach. It assigns lower priority to those on the sides with an oblique relative approach, disregarding UAVs behind and not in the relative approach. The high-fidelity simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Journal of the Franklin Institute</p></details> |

The proposed method systematically accounts for gyroscopic effects, rotor dynamics, parametric uncertainties, and external disturbances, ensuring robust performance across varying trajectory speeds. Through novel mathematical manipulation in the error system development, the quadrotor dynamics are expressed in a control-oriented form, which explicitly incorporates the uncertainty in the gyroscopic term and control actuation term. An adaptive modified RISE law is then designed to stabilize both the position and attitude loops of the quadrotor system. A rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis is utilized to prove asymptotic trajectory tracking, where the region of convergence can be made arbitrarily large through judicious control gain selection. Moreover, the stability analysis formally addresses gyroscopic effects and actuator uncertainty. To illustrate the performance of the control law, comparative numerical simulation results are provided, which demonstrate the improved closed-loop performance achieved under varying levels of parametric uncertainty, disturbance magnitudes and trajectory speeds.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under review</p></details> |

To highlight the potential of this novel method, we describe the design and implementation of the technique and show its application in an experimental setting of cognitive robotics. In this scenario, the NICO robot was characterized by the ability to point to specific points in space with precise linear movements, increasing the predictability of the robotic action during its interaction with humans. To achieve this goal, the neural network computes the forward kinematics of the robot arm. By integrating it with a generator of joint angles, another neural network was developed and trained on an artificial dataset created from suitable start and end poses of the robotic arm. Through the computation of angular velocities, the robot was characterized by its ability to perform the movement, and the quality of its action was evaluated in terms of shape and accuracy. Thanks to its broad applicability, our approach successfully generates precise trajectories that could be customized in their shape and adapted to different settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is released at https://github.com/andylucny/nico2/tree/main/generate</p></details> |

While learning-based prediction models have shown success in generating likely human trajectory predictions, integrating these stochastic models into a robot controller presents several challenges. The controller needs to account for interactive coupling between planned robot motion and human predictions while ensuring both predictions and robot actions are safe (i.e. collision-free). To address these challenges, we present a receding horizon crowd navigation method for single-robot multi-human environments. We first propose a diffusion model to generate joint trajectory predictions for all humans in the scene. We then incorporate these multi-modal predictions into a SICNav Bilevel MPC problem that simultaneously solves for a robot plan (upper-level) and acts as a safety filter to refine the predictions for non-collision (lower-level). Combining planning and prediction refinement into one bilevel problem ensures that the robot plan and human predictions are coupled. We validate the open-loop trajectory prediction performance of our diffusion model on the commonly used ETH/UCY benchmark and evaluate the closed-loop performance of our robot navigation method in simulation and extensive real-robot experiments demonstrating safe, efficient, and reactive robot motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |
| **[Predictive Risk Analysis and Safe Trajectory Planning for Intelligent and Connected Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23999v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safe trajectory planning of intelligent and connected vehicles is a key component in autonomous driving technology. Modeling the environment risk information by field is a promising and effective approach for safe trajectory planning. However, existing risk assessment theories only analyze the risk by current information, ignoring future prediction. This paper proposes a predictive risk analysis and safe trajectory planning framework for intelligent and connected vehicles. This framework first predicts future trajectories of objects by a local risk-aware algorithm, following with a spatiotemporal-discretised predictive risk analysis using the prediction results. Then the safe trajectory is generated based on the predictive risk analysis. Finally, simulation and vehicle experiments confirm the efficacy and real-time practicability of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. By estimating the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ using multiple methods (participation ratio, Kaiser rule, and the Kneedle algorithm), it is found that $m^{\ast}$ increases with the model nonlinearity. Interestingly, in the weakly nonlinear regime, for trajectories initialized by exciting the first mode, the participation ratio estimates $m^{\ast} = 2, 3$, strongly suggesting that quasi-periodic motion on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold underlies the characteristic energy recurrences observed in the FPUT model.</p></details> | 15 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Consistency Trajectory Matching for One-Step Generative Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20349v3)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) approaches achieve commendable performance at the cost of high inference overhead. Therefore, distillation techniques are utilized to accelerate the multi-step teacher model into one-step student model. Nevertheless, these methods significantly raise training costs and constrain the performance of the student model by the teacher model. To overcome these tough challenges, we propose Consistency Trajectory Matching for Super-Resolution (CTMSR), a distillation-free strategy that is able to generate photo-realistic SR results in one step. Concretely, we first formulate a Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory to establish a deterministic mapping from low-resolution (LR) images with noise to high-resolution (HR) images. Then we apply the Consistency Training (CT) strategy to directly learn the mapping in one step, eliminating the necessity of pre-trained diffusion model. To further enhance the performance and better leverage the ground-truth during the training process, we aim to align the distribution of SR results more closely with that of the natural images. To this end, we propose to minimize the discrepancy between their respective PF-ODE trajectories from the LR image distribution by our meticulously designed Distribution Trajectory Matching (DTM) loss, resulting in improved realism of our recovered HR images. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can attain comparable or even superior capabilities on both synthetic and real datasets while maintaining minimal inference latency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Trajectory and Resource Optimization for HAPs-SAR Systems with Energy-Aware Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23248v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the joint optimization of trajectory planning and resource allocation for a high-altitude platform stations synthetic aperture radar (HAPs-SAR) system. To support real-time sensing and conserve the limited energy budget of the HAPs, the proposed framework assumes that the acquired radar data are transmitted in real time to a ground base station for SAR image reconstruction. A dynamic trajectory model is developed, and the power consumption associated with radar sensing, data transmission, and circular flight is comprehensively analyzed. In addition, solar energy harvesting is considered to enhance system sustainability. An energy-aware mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem is formulated to maximize radar beam coverage while satisfying operational constraints. To solve this challenging problem, a sub-optimal successive convex approximation (SCA)-based framework is proposed, incorporating iterative optimization and finite search. Simulation results validate the convergence of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness in balancing SAR performance, communication reliability, and energy efficiency. A final SAR imaging simulation on a 9-target lattice scenario further confirms the practical feasibility of the proposed solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mode Collapse Happens: Evaluating Critical Interactions in Joint Trajectory Prediction Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23164v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Vehicle decisions rely on multimodal prediction models that account for multiple route options and the inherent uncertainty in human behavior. However, models can suffer from mode collapse, where only the most likely mode is predicted, posing significant safety risks. While existing methods employ various strategies to generate diverse predictions, they often overlook the diversity in interaction modes among agents. Additionally, traditional metrics for evaluating prediction models are dataset-dependent and do not evaluate inter-agent interactions quantitatively. To our knowledge, none of the existing metrics explicitly evaluates mode collapse. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation framework that assesses mode collapse in joint trajectory predictions, focusing on safety-critical interactions. We introduce metrics for mode collapse, mode correctness, and coverage, emphasizing the sequential dimension of predictions. By testing four multi-agent trajectory prediction models, we demonstrate that mode collapse indeed happens. When looking at the sequential dimension, although prediction accuracy improves closer to interaction events, there are still cases where the models are unable to predict the correct interaction mode, even just before the interaction mode becomes inevitable. We hope that our framework can help researchers gain new insights and advance the development of more consistent and accurate prediction models, thus enhancing the safety of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, submitted to a journal</p></details> |

In this study, we present ASPILin, which manually selects interacting agents and replaces the attention scores in Transformer with a newly computed physical correlation coefficient, enhancing the interpretability of interaction modeling. Surprisingly, these simple modifications can significantly improve prediction performance and substantially reduce computational costs. We intentionally simplified our model in other aspects, such as map encoding. Remarkably, experiments conducted on the INTERACTION, highD, and CitySim datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Aircraft Trajectory Dataset Augmentation in Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07585v2)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aircraft trajectory modeling plays a crucial role in Air Traffic Management (ATM) and is important for various downstream tasks, including conflict detection and landing time prediction. Dataset augmentation through the addition of synthetically generated trajectory data is necessary to develop a more robust aircraft trajectory model and ensure that the trajectory dataset is sufficient and balanced. In this work, we propose a novel framework called ATRADA for aircraft trajectory dataset augmentation. In the proposed framework, a Transformer encoder learns the underlying patterns in the original trajectory dataset and converts each data point into a context vector in the learned latent space. The converted dataset in the latent space is projected into reduced dimensions using principal component analysis (PCA), and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied to fit the probability distribution of the data points in the reduced-dimensional space. Finally, new samples are drawn from the fitted GMM, the dimension of the samples is reverted to the original dimension, and they are decoded with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Several experiments demonstrate that the framework effectively generates new, high-quality synthetic aircraft trajectory data, which were compared to the results of several baselines.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory enabled Unified Online Detection of Adversarial Examples and Backdoor Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22722v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proposed UniGuard is the first unified online detection framework capable of simultaneously addressing adversarial examples and backdoor attacks. UniGuard builds upon two key insights: first, both AE and backdoor attacks have to compromise the inference phase, making it possible to tackle them simultaneously during run-time via online detection. Second, an adversarial input, whether a perturbed sample in AE attacks or a trigger-carrying sample in backdoor attacks, exhibits distinctive trajectory signatures from a benign sample as it propagates through the layers of a DL model in forward inference. The propagation trajectory of the adversarial sample must deviate from that of its benign counterpart; otherwise, the adversarial objective cannot be fulfilled. Detecting these trajectory signatures is inherently challenging due to their subtlety; UniGuard overcomes this by treating the propagation trajectory as a time-series signal, leveraging LSTM and spectrum transformation to amplify differences between adversarial and benign trajectories that are subtle in the time domain. UniGuard exceptional efficiency and effectiveness have been extensively validated across various modalities (image, text, and audio) and tasks (classification and regression), ranging from diverse model architectures against a wide range of AE attacks and backdoor attacks, including challenging partial backdoors and dynamic triggers. When compared to SOTA methods, including ContraNet (NDSS 22) specific for AE detection and TED (IEEE SP 24) specific for backdoor detection, UniGuard consistently demonstrates superior performance, even when matched against each method's strengths in addressing their respective threats-each SOTA fails to parts of attack strategies while UniGuard succeeds for all.</p></details> |  |
| **[Economic Model Predictive Control with a Non-Fixed Reference Trajectory for Optimal Microgrid Dispatch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22406v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC), instead of stabilizing a reference trajectory/state in the objective function like a Tracking MPC, optimizes the economic performance over the prediction horizon, making it attractive for economical microgrid (MG) dispatch. However, the demand charge component in the monthly electricity cost, make it difficult to be encapsulated in additive stage costs, and can make solutions violate the principle of optimality if naively introduced in the objective function. Moreover, previous EMPC based works mostly rely on a-priori knowledge of an optimal economic steady state or optimal periodic trajectory for performance guarantees, which are not useful or possibly don't exist respectively, for real-time economical MG dispatch where load/generation forecasts are known only 24-48 h in advance. This paper, first, proposes an EMPC formulation for a generic deterministic discrete non-linear time varying system with hard state and input constraints, without any a-priori requirements of an optimal economic steady state or optimal periodic trajectory. It is proved that under mild assumptions on terminal cost and region, the asymptotic average economic cost of the proposed method is no worse than the asymptotic average economic cost of any other non-fixed arbitrary reference trajectory which is known only until the current time-step. The EMPC framework is then leveraged for optimal MG dispatch by showing that the problem can be reformulated to satisfy the assumptions required for the asymptotic performance guarantee. Realistic simulations at the Port of San Diego MG demonstrated that the proposed method can also reduce monthly electricity costs in closed-loop with respect to reference trajectories generated by directly optimizing the electricity cost function over the prediction horizon or by tracking an ideal grid import curve in a majority of the cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 tables, Manuscript under review</p></details> |
| **[Pedestrian Intention and Trajectory Prediction in Unstructured Traffic Using IDD-PeD](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22111v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancements in autonomous driving, accurately predicting pedestrian behavior has become essential for ensuring safety in complex and unpredictable traffic conditions. The growing interest in this challenge highlights the need for comprehensive datasets that capture unstructured environments, enabling the development of more robust prediction models to enhance pedestrian safety and vehicle navigation. In this paper, we introduce an Indian driving pedestrian dataset designed to address the complexities of modeling pedestrian behavior in unstructured environments, such as illumination changes, occlusion of pedestrians, unsignalized scene types and vehicle-pedestrian interactions. The dataset provides high-level and detailed low-level comprehensive annotations focused on pedestrians requiring the ego-vehicle's attention. Evaluation of the state-of-the-art intention prediction methods on our dataset shows a significant performance drop of up to $\mathbf{15\%}$, while trajectory prediction methods underperform with an increase of up to $\mathbf{1208}$ MSE, defeating standard pedestrian datasets. Additionally, we present exhaustive quantitative and qualitative analysis of intention and trajectory baselines. We believe that our dataset will open new challenges for the pedestrian behavior research community to build robust models.

While many models have been developed towards this end, effectively capturing and predicting the variability inherent to human behavior still remains an open challenge. This paper proposes TrajFlow - a new approach for probabilistic trajectory prediction based on Normalizing Flows. We reformulate the problem of capturing distributions over trajectories into capturing distributions over abstracted trajectory features using an autoencoder, simplifying the learning task of the Normalizing Flows. TrajFlow outperforms state-of-the-art behavior prediction models in capturing full trajectory distributions in two synthetic benchmarks with known true distributions, and is competitive on the naturalistic datasets ETH/UCY, rounD, and nuScenes. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of TrajFlow in probabilistic prediction of human behavior.</p></details> |  |

However, how to model the representation of trajectory-level data presents a significant challenge that has not been systematically addressed amid explosive trajectory data growth. In this work, we introduce Multimodal Trajectory Retrieval, bridging the gap between universal retrieval and agent-centric trajectory modeling. We construct the Unified Agent Trajectory Dataset (UATD) from annotated demonstrations and states across diverse real-world scenarios. Based on this, we present GAE-Bench, a benchmark containing a large number of trajectory-based retrieval pairs. In addition, we propose GAE-Retriever, a multimodal retrieval framework that adopts vision-language models and incorporates optimized contrastive learning through a token selection and the GradCache mechanism. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple datasets show that GAE-Retriever consistently outperforms strong baselines in retrieval recall, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing multimodal trajectory retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 3 figures, accepted by Workshop on Computer-use Agents @ ICML 2025</p></details> |

Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods.

However, this requires that the dataset be labeled by a reward function. In applied settings such as video game development, the availability of the reward function is not always guaranteed. This paper proposes Trajectory-Ranked OFfline Inverse reinforcement learning (TROFI), a novel approach to effectively learn a policy offline without a pre-defined reward function. TROFI first learns a reward function from human preferences, which it then uses to label the original dataset making it usable for training the policy. In contrast to other approaches, our method does not require optimal trajectories. Through experiments on the D4RL benchmark we demonstrate that TROFI consistently outperforms baselines and performs comparably to using the ground truth reward to learn policies. Additionally, we validate the efficacy of our method in a 3D game environment. Our studies of the reward model highlight the importance of the reward function in this setting: we show that to ensure the alignment of a value function to the actual future discounted reward, it is fundamental to have a well-engineered and easy-to-learn reward function.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at Reinforcement Learning and Video Games Workshop at RLC 2025</p></details> |

However, existing 3D world models are primarily limited to single-material dynamics using a particle-based Graph Neural Network model, and often require time-consuming 3D scene reconstruction to obtain 3D particle tracks for training. In this work, we present ParticleFormer, a Transformer-based point cloud world model trained with a hybrid point cloud reconstruction loss, supervising both global and local dynamics features in multi-material, multi-object robot interactions. ParticleFormer captures fine-grained multi-object interactions between rigid, deformable, and flexible materials, trained directly from real-world robot perception data without an elaborate scene reconstruction. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness both in 3D scene forecasting tasks, and in downstream manipulation tasks using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) policy. In addition, we extend existing dynamics learning benchmarks to include diverse multi-material, multi-object interaction scenarios. We validate our method on six simulation and three real-world experiments, where it consistently outperforms leading baselines by achieving superior dynamics prediction accuracy and less rollout error in downstream visuomotor tasks. Experimental videos are available at https://particleformer.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Studying and Improving Graph Neural Network-based Motif Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15709v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a predominant method for graph representation learning. However, beyond subgraph frequency estimation, their application to network motif significance-profile (SP) prediction remains under-explored, with no established benchmarks in the literature. We propose to address this problem, framing SP estimation as a task independent of subgraph frequency estimation. Our approach shifts from frequency counting to direct SP estimation and modulates the problem as multitarget regression. The reformulation is optimised for interpretability, stability and scalability on large graphs. We validate our method using a large synthetic dataset and further test it on real-world graphs. Our experiments reveal that 1-WL limited models struggle to make precise estimations of SPs. However, they can generalise to approximate the graph generation processes of networks by comparing their predicted SP with the ones originating from synthetic generators. This first study on GNN-based motif estimation also hints at how using direct SP estimation can help go past the theoretical limitations that motif estimation faces when performed through subgraph counting.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript represents a revised version from the paper on https://openreview.net/forum?id=PZVVOeu6xx.

| **[An Automatic Graph Construction Framework based on Large Language Models for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18241v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as state-of-the-art methods to learn from graph-structured data for recommendation. However, most existing GNN-based recommendation methods focus on the optimization of model structures and learning strategies based on pre-defined graphs, neglecting the importance of the graph construction stage. Earlier works for graph construction usually rely on speciffic rules or crowdsourcing, which are either too simplistic or too labor-intensive. Recent works start to utilize large language models (LLMs) to automate the graph construction, in view of their abundant open-world knowledge and remarkable reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, they generally suffer from two limitations: (1) invisibility of global view (e.g., overlooking contextual information) and (2) construction inefficiency. To this end, we introduce AutoGraph, an automatic graph construction framework based on LLMs for recommendation. Specifically, we first use LLMs to infer the user preference and item knowledge, which is encoded as semantic vectors. Next, we employ vector quantization to extract the latent factors from the semantic vectors. The latent factors are then incorporated as extra nodes to link the user/item nodes, resulting in a graph with in-depth global-view semantics. We further design metapath-based message aggregation to effectively aggregate the semantic and collaborative information. The framework is model-agnostic and compatible with different backbone models. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy and efffciency of AutoGraph compared to existing baseline methods. We have deployed AutoGraph in Huawei advertising platform, and gain a 2.69% improvement on RPM and a 7.31% improvement on eCPM in the online A/B test. Currently AutoGraph has been used as the main trafffc model, serving hundreds of millions of people.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD'25 |
| **[Generative Modeling of Full-Atom Protein Conformations using Latent Diffusion on Graph Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17064v3)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating diverse, all-atom conformational ensembles of dynamic proteins such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is critical for understanding their function, yet most generative models simplify atomic detail or ignore conformational diversity altogether. We present latent diffusion for full protein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom protein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural network (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein conformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind, sequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent representations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by dihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a 2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D2 receptor in a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategy reproduces the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom lDDT of approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8) and recovers backbone and side-chain dihedral-angle distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of less than 0.03 compared to the MD data. LD-FPG thereby offers a practical route to system-specific, all-atom ensemble generation for large proteins, providing a promising tool for structure-based therapeutic design on complex, dynamic targets. The D2R-MD dataset and our implementation are freely available to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (main text), 4 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Bridging Theory and Practice in Link Representation with Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24018v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used to compute representations of node pairs for downstream tasks such as link prediction. Yet, theoretical understanding of their expressive power has focused almost entirely on graph-level representations. In this work, we shift the focus to links and provide the first comprehensive study of GNN expressiveness in link representation. We introduce a unifying framework, the $k_\phi$-$k_\rho$-$m$ framework, that subsumes existing message-passing link models and enables formal expressiveness comparisons. Using this framework, we derive a hierarchy of state-of-the-art methods and offer theoretical tools to analyze future architectures. To complement our analysis, we propose a synthetic evaluation protocol comprising the first benchmark specifically designed to assess link-level expressiveness. Finally, we ask: does expressiveness matter in practice? We use a graph symmetry metric that quantifies the difficulty of distinguishing links and show that while expressive models may underperform on standard benchmarks, they significantly outperform simpler ones as symmetry increases, highlighting the need for dataset-aware model selection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Z-REx: Human-Interpretable GNN Explanations for Real Estate Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18001v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transparency and interpretability are crucial for enhancing customer confidence and user engagement, especially when dealing with black-box Machine Learning (ML)-based recommendation systems. Modern recommendation systems leverage Graph Neural Network (GNN) due to their ability to produce high-quality recommendations in terms of both relevance and diversity. Therefore, the explainability of GNN is especially important for Link Prediction (LP) tasks since recommending relevant items can be viewed as predicting links between users and items. GNN explainability has been a well-studied field, but existing methods primarily focus on node or graph-level tasks, leaving a gap in LP explanation techniques. This work introduces Z-REx, a GNN explanation framework designed explicitly for heterogeneous link prediction tasks. Z-REx utilizes structural and attribute perturbation to identify critical substructures and important features while reducing the search space by leveraging domain-specific knowledge. In our experimentation, we show the efficacy of Z-REx in generating contextually relevant and human-interpretable explanations for ZiGNN, a GNN-based recommendation engine, using a real-world real-estate dataset from Zillow Group, Inc. We compare against State-of-The-Art (SOTA) GNN explainers to show Z-REx outperforms them by 61% in the Fidelity metric by producing superior human-interpretable explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published in KDD Workshop in Machine Learning on Graphs in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence (MLoG-GenAI@KDD) 2025</p></details> |
| **[NeuralOM: Neural Ocean Model for Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21020v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) ocean simulation is critically important for marine research, yet remains challenging due to its substantial thermal inertia and extended time delay. Machine learning (ML)-based models have demonstrated significant advancements in simulation accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional numerical methods. Nevertheless, a significant limitation of current ML models for S2S ocean simulation is their inadequate incorporation of physical consistency and the slow-changing properties of the ocean system. In this work, we propose a neural ocean model (NeuralOM) for S2S ocean simulation with a multi-scale interactive graph neural network to emulate diverse physical phenomena associated with ocean systems effectively. Specifically, we propose a multi-stage framework tailored to model the ocean's slowly changing nature. Additionally, we introduce a multi-scale interactive messaging module to capture complex dynamical behaviors, such as gradient changes and multiplicative coupling relationships inherent in ocean dynamics. Extensive experimental evaluations confirm that our proposed NeuralOM outperforms state-of-the-art models in S2S and extreme event simulation.

| **[When GNNs Met a Word Equations Solver: Learning to Rank Equations (Extended Technical Report)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23784v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nielsen transformation is a standard approach for solving word equations: by repeatedly splitting equations and applying simplification steps, equations are rewritten until a solution is reached. When solving a conjunction of word equations in this way, the performance of the solver will depend considerably on the order in which equations are processed. In this work, the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for ranking word equations before and during the solving process is explored. For this, a novel graph-based representation for word equations is presented, preserving global information across conjuncts, enabling the GNN to have a holistic view during ranking. To handle the variable number of conjuncts, three approaches to adapt a multi-classification task to the problem of ranking equations are proposed. The training of the GNN is done with the help of minimum unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes) of word equations. The experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art string solvers, the new framework solves more problems in benchmarks where each variable appears at most once in each equation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Calibrating Graph Neural Networks with Wavelet-Aware Temperature Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23782v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong predictive performance on relational data; however, their confidence estimates often misalign with actual predictive correctness, posing significant limitations for deployment in safety-critical settings. While existing graph-aware calibration methods seek to mitigate this limitation, they primarily depend on coarse one-hop statistics, such as neighbor-predicted confidence, or latent node embeddings, thereby neglecting the fine-grained structural heterogeneity inherent in graph topology. In this work, we propose Wavelet-Aware Temperature Scaling (WATS), a post-hoc calibration framework that assigns node-specific temperatures based on tunable heat-kernel graph wavelet features. Specifically, WATS harnesses the scalability and topology sensitivity of graph wavelets to refine confidence estimates, all without necessitating model retraining or access to neighboring logits or predictions. Extensive evaluations across seven benchmark datasets with varying graph structures and two GNN backbones demonstrate that WATS achieves the lowest Expected Calibration Error (ECE) among all compared methods, outperforming both classical and graph-specific baselines by up to 42.3\% in ECE and reducing calibration variance by 17.24\% on average compared with graph-specific methods. Moreover, WATS remains computationally efficient, scaling well across graphs of diverse sizes and densities. Code will be released based on publication.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Adaptive Supergeo Design (ASD), a two-stage framework that renders Supergeo designs practical for thousands of markets. A bespoke graph-neural network first learns geo-embeddings and proposes a concise candidate set of 'supergeos'; a CP-SAT solver then selects a partition that balances both baseline outcomes and pre-treatment covariates believed to modify the treatment effect. We prove that ASD's objective value is within (1+epsilon) of the global optimum under mild community-structure assumptions. In simulations with up to 1,000 Designated Market Areas ASD completes in minutes on standard hardware, retains every media dollar, and cuts iROAS bias substantively relative to existing methods. ASD therefore turns geo-lift testing into a routine, scalable component of media planning while preserving statistical rigour.</p></details> |  |
| **[CPT: Competence-progressive Training Strategy for Few-shot Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00450v5)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have made significant advancements in node classification, but their success relies on sufficient labeled nodes per class in the training data. Real-world graph data often exhibits a long-tail distribution with sparse labels, emphasizing the importance of GNNs' ability in few-shot node classification, which entails categorizing nodes with limited data. Traditional episodic meta-learning approaches have shown promise in this domain, but they face an inherent limitation: it might lead the model to converge to suboptimal solutions because of random and uniform task assignment, ignoring task difficulty levels. This could lead the meta-learner to face complex tasks too soon, hindering proper learning. Ideally, the meta-learner should start with simple concepts and advance to more complex ones, like human learning. So, we introduce CPT, a novel two-stage curriculum learning method that aligns task difficulty with the meta-learner's progressive competence, enhancing overall performance. Specifically, in CPT's initial stage, the focus is on simpler tasks, fostering foundational skills for engaging with complex tasks later. Importantly, the second stage dynamically adjusts task difficulty based on the meta-learner's growing competence, aiming for optimal knowledge acquisition. Extensive experiments on popular node classification datasets demonstrate significant improvements of our strategy over existing methods.</p></details> | APWEB-WAIM 2025 |

The results can then be further improved with re-ranking methods that re-order the top scoring images. However, existing methods focus on re-ranking based on the same image descriptors that were used for the initial retrieval, which we argue provides limited additional signal. In this work we propose Generalized Contextual Similarity Aggregation (GCSA), which is a graph neural network-based re-ranking method that, in addition to the visual descriptors, can leverage other types of available side information. This can for example be other sensor data (such as signal strength of nearby WiFi or BlueTooth endpoints) or geometric properties such as camera poses for database images. In many applications this information is already present or can be acquired with low effort. Our architecture leverages the concept of affinity vectors to allow for a shared encoding of the heterogeneous multi-modal input. Two large-scale datasets, covering both outdoor and indoor localization scenarios, are utilized for training and evaluation. In experiments we show significant improvement not only on image retrieval metrics, but also for the downstream visual localization task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Scandinavian Conference on Image Analysis (SCIA) 2025</p></details> |
| **[RegionGCN: Spatial-Heterogeneity-Aware Graph Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17599v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling spatial heterogeneity in the data generation process is essential for understanding and predicting geographical phenomena. Despite their prevalence in geospatial tasks, neural network models usually assume spatial stationarity, which could limit their performance in the presence of spatial process heterogeneity. By allowing model parameters to vary over space, several approaches have been proposed to incorporate spatial heterogeneity into neural networks. However, current geographically weighting approaches are ineffective on graph neural networks, yielding no significant improvement in prediction accuracy. We assume the crux lies in the over-fitting risk brought by a large number of local parameters. Accordingly, we propose to model spatial process heterogeneity at the regional level rather than at the individual level, which largely reduces the number of spatially varying parameters. We further develop a heuristic optimization procedure to learn the region partition adaptively in the process of model training. Our proposed spatial-heterogeneity-aware graph convolutional network, named RegionGCN, is applied to the spatial prediction of county-level vote share in the 2016 US presidential election based on socioeconomic attributes. Results show that RegionGCN achieves significant improvement over the basic and geographically weighted GCNs. We also offer an exploratory analysis tool for the spatial variation of non-linear relationships through ensemble learning of regional partitions from RegionGCN. Our work contributes to the practice of Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) in tackling spatial heterogeneity.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Data Filtering for Genetic Perturbation Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14571v3)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Genomic studies, including CRISPR-based PerturbSeq analyses, face a vast hypothesis space, while gene perturbations remain costly and time-consuming. Gene expression models based on graph neural networks are trained to predict the outcomes of gene perturbations to facilitate such experiments. Active learning methods are often employed to train these models due to the cost of the genomic experiments required to build the training set. However, poor model initialization in active learning can result in suboptimal early selections, wasting time and valuable resources. While typical active learning mitigates this issue over many iterations, the limited number of experimental cycles in genomic studies exacerbates the risk. To this end, we propose graph-based data filtering as an alternative. Unlike active learning, data filtering selects the gene perturbations before training, meaning it is free of bias due to random initialization and initial random selection. Moreover, reducing the iterations between the wet lab and the model provides several operational advantages resulting in significant acceleration. The proposed methods are motivated by theoretical studies of graph neural network generalization. The criteria are defined over the input graph and are optimized with submodular maximization. We compare them empirically to baselines and active learning methods that are state-of-the-art. The results demonstrate that graph-based data filtering achieves comparable accuracy while alleviating the aforementioned risks.</p></details> | 21 pages |

A typical scenario involves scammers deploying honeypot contracts to attract investments, restricting token sales, and draining the funds, which leaves investors with worthless tokens. Current methods either rely on predefined patterns to detect code risks or utilize statistical transaction data to train detection models. However, real-world Rug Pull schemes often involve a complex interplay between malicious code and suspicious transaction behaviors. These methods, which solely focus on one aspect, fall short in detecting such schemes effectively. In this paper, we propose RPHunter, a novel technique that integrates code and transaction for Rug Pull detection. First, RPHunter establishes declarative rules and performs flow analysis to extract code risk information, further constructing a semantic risk code graph (SRCG). Meanwhile, to leverage transaction information, RPHunter formulates dynamic token transaction activities as a token flow behavior graph (TFBG) in which nodes and edges are characterized from network structure and market manipulation perspectives. Finally, RPHunter employs graph neural networks to extract complementary features from SRCG and TFBG, integrating them through an attention fusion model to enhance the detection of Rug Pull. We manually analyzed 645 Rug Pull incidents from code and transaction aspects and constructed a ground-truth dataset. We evaluated RPHunter on our dataset, achieving a precision of 95.3%, a recall of 93.8% and an F1 score of 94.5%, which highlights superior performance compared to existing methods. Furthermore, when applied to the real-world scenarios, RPHunter has identified 4801 Rug Pull tokens, achieving a precision of 90.7%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Double-Diffusion: Diffusion Conditioned Diffusion Probabilistic Model For Air Quality Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23053v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Air quality prediction is a challenging forecasting task due to its spatio-temporal complexity and the inherent dynamics as well as uncertainty. Most of the current models handle these two challenges by applying Graph Neural Networks or known physics principles, and quantifying stochasticity through probabilistic networks like Diffusion models. Nevertheless, finding the right balancing point between the certainties and uncertainties remains an open question. Therefore, we propose Double-Diffusion, a novel diffusion probabilistic model that harnesses the power of known physics to guide air quality forecasting with stochasticity. To the best of our knowledge, while precedents have been made of using conditional diffusion models to predict air pollution, this is the first attempt to use physics as a conditional generative approach for air quality prediction. Along with a sampling strategy adopted from image restoration and a new denoiser architecture, Double-Diffusion ranks first in most evaluation scenarios across two real-life datasets compared with other probabilistic models, it also cuts inference time by 50% to 30% while enjoying an increase between 3-12% in Continuous Ranked Probabilistic Score (CRPS).</p></details> |  |
| **[Prediction Gaps as Pathways to Explanation: Rethinking Educational Outcomes through Differences in Model Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22993v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social contexts -- such as families, schools, and neighborhoods -- shape life outcomes. The key question is not simply whether they matter, but rather for whom and under what conditions. Here, we argue that prediction gaps -- differences in predictive performance between statistical models of varying complexity -- offer a pathway for identifying surprising empirical patterns (i.e., not captured by simpler models) which highlight where theories succeed or fall short. Using population-scale administrative data from the Netherlands, we compare logistic regression, gradient boosting, and graph neural networks to predict university completion using early-life social contexts. Overall, prediction gaps are small, suggesting that previously identified indicators, particularly parental status, capture most measurable variation in educational attainment. However, gaps are larger for girls growing up without fathers -- suggesting that the effects of social context for these groups go beyond simple models in line with sociological theory. Our paper shows the potential of prediction methods to support sociological explanation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Missing-Modality-Aware Graph Neural Network for Cancer Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22901v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key challenge in learning from multimodal biological data is missing modalities, where all data from some modalities are missing for some patients. Current fusion methods address this by excluding patients with missing modalities, imputing missing modalities, or making predictions directly with partial modalities. However, they often struggle with diverse missing-modality patterns and the exponential growth of the number of such patterns as the number of modalities increases. To address these limitations, we propose MAGNET (Missing-modality-Aware Graph neural NETwork) for direct prediction with partial modalities, which introduces a patient-modality multi-head attention mechanism to fuse lower-dimensional modality embeddings based on their importance and missingness. MAGNET's complexity increases linearly with the number of modalities while adapting to missing-pattern variability. To generate predictions, MAGNET further constructs a patient graph with fused multimodal embeddings as node features and the connectivity determined by the modality missingness, followed by a conventional graph neural network. Experiments on three public multiomics datasets for cancer classification, with real-world instead of artificial missingness, show that MAGNET outperforms the state-of-the-art fusion methods. The data and code are available at https://github.com/SinaTabakhi/MAGNET.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Graph Contrastive Learning with Low-Rank Regularization and Low-Rank Attention for Noisy Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09600v2)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in learning node representations and have shown strong performance in tasks such as node classification. However, recent findings indicate that the presence of noise in real-world graph data can substantially impair the effectiveness of GNNs. To address this challenge, we introduce a robust and innovative node representation learning method named Graph Contrastive Learning with Low-Rank Regularization, or GCL-LRR, which follows a two-stage transductive learning framework for node classification. In the first stage, the GCL-LRR encoder is optimized through prototypical contrastive learning while incorporating a low-rank regularization objective. In the second stage, the representations generated by GCL-LRR are employed by a linear transductive classifier to predict the labels of unlabeled nodes within the graph. Our GCL-LRR is inspired by the Low Frequency Property (LFP) of the graph data and its labels, and it is also theoretically motivated by our sharp generalization bound for transductive learning. To the best of our knowledge, our theoretical result is among the first to theoretically demonstrate the advantage of low-rank regularization in transductive learning, which is also supported by strong empirical results. To further enhance the performance of GCL-LRR, we present an improved model named GCL-LR-Attention, which incorporates a novel LR-Attention layer into GCL-LRR. GCL-LR-Attention reduces the kernel complexity of GCL-LRR and contributes to a tighter generalization bound, leading to improved performance. Extensive evaluations on standard benchmark datasets evidence the effectiveness and robustness of both GCL-LRR and GCL-LR-Attention in learning meaningful node representations. The code is available at https://github.com/Statistical-Deep-Learning/GCL-LR-Attention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Convergent Privacy Framework with Contractive GNN Layers for Multi-hop Aggregations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22727v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential privacy (DP) has been integrated into graph neural networks (GNNs) to protect sensitive structural information, e.g., edges, nodes, and associated features across various applications. A common approach is to perturb the message-passing process, which forms the core of most GNN architectures. However, existing methods typically incur a privacy cost that grows linearly with the number of layers (Usenix Security'23), ultimately requiring excessive noise to maintain a reasonable privacy level. This limitation becomes particularly problematic when deep GNNs are necessary to capture complex and long-range interactions in graphs. In this paper, we theoretically establish that the privacy budget can converge with respect to the number of layers by applying privacy amplification techniques to the message-passing process, exploiting the contractive properties inherent to standard GNN operations. Motivated by this analysis, we propose a simple yet effective Contractive Graph Layer (CGL) that ensures the contractiveness required for theoretical guarantees while preserving model utility. Our framework, CARIBOU, supports both training and inference, equipped with a contractive aggregation module, a privacy allocation module, and a privacy auditing module. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that CARIBOU significantly improves the privacy-utility trade-off and achieves superior performance in privacy auditing tasks.</p></details> | 23 pages |

However, attributing predictions to specific edges or features remains computationally expensive. For example, classifying a node with 100 neighbors using a 3-layer GNN may involve identifying important edges from millions of candidates contributing to the prediction. To address this challenge, we propose DistShap, a parallel algorithm that distributes Shapley value-based explanations across multiple GPUs. DistShap operates by sampling subgraphs in a distributed setting, executing GNN inference in parallel across GPUs, and solving a distributed least squares problem to compute edge importance scores. DistShap outperforms most existing GNN explanation methods in accuracy and is the first to scale to GNN models with millions of features by using up to 128 GPUs on the NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Message-passing GNNs model interactions beyond their immediate neighborhood by propagating local information between neighboring particles while remaining effectively local. However, locality precludes modeling long-range effects critical to many real-world systems, such as charge transfer, electrostatic interactions, and dispersion effects. In this work, we propose the Charge Equilibration Layer for Long-range Interactions (CELLI) to address the challenge of efficiently modeling non-local interactions. This novel architecture generalizes the classical charge equilibration (Qeq) method to a model-agnostic building block for modern equivariant GNN potentials. Therefore, CELLI extends the capability of GNNs to model long-range interactions while providing high interpretability through explicitly modeled charges. On benchmark systems, CELLI achieves state-of-the-art results for strictly local models. CELLI generalizes to diverse datasets and large structures while providing high computational efficiency and robust predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoATA: Effective Co-Augmentation of Topology and Attribute for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22299v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered substantial attention due to their remarkable capability in learning graph representations. However, real-world graphs often exhibit substantial noise and incompleteness, which severely degrades the performance of GNNs. Existing methods typically address this issue through single-dimensional augmentation, focusing either on refining topology structures or perturbing node attributes, thereby overlooking the deeper interplays between the two. To bridge this gap, this paper presents CoATA, a dual-channel GNN framework specifically designed for the Co-Augmentation of Topology and Attribute. Specifically, CoATA first propagates structural signals to enrich and denoise node attributes. Then, it projects the enhanced attribute space into a node-attribute bipartite graph for further refinement or reconstruction of the underlying structure. Subsequently, CoATA introduces contrastive learning, leveraging prototype alignment and consistency constraints, to facilitate mutual corrections between the augmented and original graphs. Finally, extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed CoATA outperforms eleven state-of-the-art baseline methods, showcasing its effectiveness in capturing the synergistic relationship between topology and attributes.</p></details> | icmr |

Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The question is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally, to assess performance beyond prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks in terms of their computational complexity and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task-Agnostic Contrastive Pretraining for Relational Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22530v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational Deep Learning (RDL) is an emerging paradigm that leverages Graph Neural Network principles to learn directly from relational databases by representing them as heterogeneous graphs. However, existing RDL models typically rely on task-specific supervised learning, requiring training separate models for each predictive task, which may hamper scalability and reuse. In this work, we propose a novel task-agnostic contrastive pretraining approach for RDL that enables database-wide representation learning. For that aim, we introduce three levels of contrastive objectives$-$row-level, link-level, and context-level$-$designed to capture the structural and semantic heterogeneity inherent to relational data. We implement the respective pretraining approach through a modular RDL architecture and an efficient sampling strategy tailored to the heterogeneous database setting. Our preliminary results on standard RDL benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning the pretrained models measurably outperforms training from scratch, validating the promise of the proposed methodology in learning transferable representations for relational data.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2506.22199</p></details> |

They typically exhibit distinctive structure and domain-specific knowledge, motivating the development of a Graph Foundation Model (GFM) that generalizes across diverse graphs and tasks. Despite large efforts to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for TAGs, existing approaches suffer from decoupled architectures with two-stage alignment, limiting their synergistic potential. Even worse, existing methods assign out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens to graph nodes, leading to graph-specific semantics, token explosion, and incompatibility with task-oriented prompt templates, which hinders cross-graph and cross-task transferability. To address these challenges, we propose PromptGFM, a versatile GFM for TAGs grounded in graph vocabulary learning. PromptGFM comprises two key components: (1) Graph Understanding Module, which explicitly prompts LLMs to replicate the finest GNN workflow within the text space, facilitating seamless GNN-LLM integration and elegant graph-text alignment; (2) Graph Inference Module, which establishes a language-based graph vocabulary ensuring expressiveness, transferability, and scalability, enabling readable instructions for LLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superiority and transferability across diverse graphs and tasks. The code is available at this: https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptGFM.</p></details> |  |
| **[MisinfoTeleGraph: Network-driven Misinformation Detection for German Telegram Messages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22529v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Connectivity and message propagation are central, yet often underutilized, sources of information in misinformation detection -- especially on poorly moderated platforms such as Telegram, which has become a critical channel for misinformation dissemination, namely in the German electoral context. In this paper, we introduce Misinfo-TeleGraph, the first German-language Telegram-based graph dataset for misinformation detection. It includes over 5 million messages from public channels, enriched with metadata, channel relationships, and both weak and strong labels. These labels are derived via semantic similarity to fact-checks and news articles using M3-embeddings, as well as manual annotation. To establish reproducible baselines, we evaluate both text-only models and graph neural networks (GNNs) that incorporate message forwarding as a network structure. Our results show that GraphSAGE with LSTM aggregation significantly outperforms text-only baselines in terms of Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and F1-score. We further evaluate the impact of subscribers, view counts, and automatically versus human-created labels on performance, and highlight both the potential and challenges of weak supervision in this domain. This work provides a reproducible benchmark and open dataset for future research on misinformation detection in German-language Telegram networks and other low-moderation social platforms.</p></details> |  |

Practitioners, novices and legal AI systems need access to these relevant data to inform appraisals and judgments. We propose a Graph-Neural-Network (GNN) link prediction model that can identify Case-Law and Case-Case citations with high proficiency through fusion of semantic and topological information. We introduce adapted relational graph convolutions operating on an extended and enriched version of the original citation graph that allow the topological integration of semantic meta-information. This further improves prediction by 3.1 points of average precision and by 8.5 points in data sparsity as well as showing robust performance over time and in challenging fully inductive prediction. Jointly learning and predicting case and norm citations achieves a large synergistic effect that improves case citation prediction by up to 4.7 points, at almost doubled efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically project predefined goal-reaching controllers onto control barrier function (CBF) constraints, often resulting in conservative and suboptimal trade-offs between safety and goal-reaching performance. We propose an infinite-horizon CBF-constrained optimal graph control formulation for distributed safe multi-agent navigation. By deriving the analytical solution structure, we develop a novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB)-based learning framework to approximate the solution. In particular, our algorithm jointly learns a CBF and a distributed control policy, both parameterized by graph neural networks (GNNs), along with a value function that robustly guides agents toward their goals. Moreover, we introduce a state-dependent parameterization of Lagrange multipliers, enabling dynamic trade-offs between safety and performance. Unlike traditional short-horizon, quadratic programming-based CBF methods, our approach leverages long-horizon optimization to proactively avoid deadlocks and navigate complex environments more effectively. Extensive simulation results demonstrate substantial improvements in safety and task success rates across various agent dynamics, with strong scalability and generalization to large-scale teams in previously unseen environments. Real-world experiments using Crazyflie drone swarms on challenging antipodal position-swapping tasks further validate the practicality, generalizability, and robustness of the proposed HJB-GNN learning framework.</p></details> |  |

We show how Transformers can be viewed as message passing GNNs operating on fully connected graphs of tokens, where the self-attention mechanism capture the relative importance of all tokens w.r.t. each-other, and positional encodings provide hints about sequential ordering or structure. Thus, Transformers are expressive set processing networks that learn relationships among input elements without being constrained by apriori graphs. Despite this mathematical connection to GNNs, Transformers are implemented via dense matrix operations that are significantly more efficient on modern hardware than sparse message passing. This leads to the perspective that Transformers are GNNs currently winning the hardware lottery.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is a technical version of an article in The Gradient at https://thegradient.pub/transformers-are-graph-neural-networks/</p></details> |

It not only supports educational diagnostics and analytics but also enhances complex downstream tasks like information retrieval and question answering by associating questions with relevant categories. Traditional methods, often based on word embeddings and conventional classifiers, struggle to capture the nuanced relationships in question statements, leading to suboptimal performance. We propose a novel approach leveraging graph convolutional networks, named Phrase Question-Graph Convolutional Network (PQ-GCN). Through PQ-GCN, we evaluate the incorporation of phrase-based features to enhance classification performance on question datasets of various domains and characteristics. The proposed method, augmented with phrase-based features, outperform baseline graph-based methods in low-resource settings, and performs competitively against language model-based methods with a fraction of their parameter size. Our findings offer a possible solution for more context-aware, parameter-efficient question classification, bridging the gap between graph neural network research and its educational applications.</p></details> |  |

To tackle challenges of processing multi-source, multi-fidelity data during pre-training, recent studies employ multi-task learning, in which shared message passing layers initially process input atomistic structures regardless of source, then route them to multiple decoding heads that predict data-specific outputs. This approach stabilizes pre-training and enhances a model's transferability to unexplored chemical regions. Preliminary results on approximately four million structures are encouraging, yet questions remain about generalizability to larger, more diverse datasets and scalability on supercomputers. We propose a multi-task parallelism method that distributes each head across computing resources with GPU acceleration. Implemented in the open-source HydraGNN architecture, our method was trained on over 24 million structures from five datasets and tested on the Perlmutter, Aurora, and Frontier supercomputers, demonstrating efficient scaling on all three highly heterogeneous super-computing architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

GNN models often contain millions of parameters, and like other neural network (NN) models, are often fed only a fraction of the graphs that make up the training dataset in batches to update model parameters. The effect of batching algorithms on training time and model performance has been thoroughly explored for NNs but not yet for GNNs. We analyze two different batching algorithms for graph based models, namely static and dynamic batching for two datasets, the QM9 dataset of small molecules and the AFLOW materials database. Our experiments show that changing the batching algorithm can provide up to a 2.7x speedup, but the fastest algorithm depends on the data, model, batch size, hardware, and number of training steps run. Experiments show that for a select number of combinations of batch size, dataset, and model, significant differences in model learning metrics are observed between static and dynamic batching algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Most solutions to this problem remain confined to the task of node classification. In this article, we focus on the valuable task of link prediction under heterophily, an interesting problem for recommendation systems, social network analysis, and other applications. GNNs like GRAFF have improved node classification under heterophily by incorporating physics biases in the architecture. Similarly, we propose GRAFF-LP, an extension of GRAFF for link prediction. We show that GRAFF-LP effectively discriminates existing from non-existing edges by learning implicitly to separate the edge gradients. Based on this information, we propose a new readout function inspired by physics. Remarkably, this new function not only enhances the performance of GRAFF-LP but also improves that of other baseline models, leading us to reconsider how every link prediction experiment has been conducted so far. Finally, we provide evidence that even simple GNNs did not experience greater difficulty in predicting heterophilic links compared to homophilic ones. This leads us to believe in the necessity for heterophily measures specifically tailored for link prediction, distinct from those used in node classification.

MLPs Suffice for Language Model Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21682v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explicit structural information has been proven to be encoded by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), serving as auxiliary knowledge to enhance model capabilities and improve performance in downstream NLP tasks. However, recent studies indicate that GNNs fail to fully utilize structural information, whereas Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), despite lacking the message-passing mechanisms inherent to GNNs, exhibit a surprising ability in structure-aware tasks. Motivated by these findings, this paper introduces a comprehensive probing framework from an information-theoretic perspective. The framework is designed to systematically assess the role of explicit structural modeling in enhancing language model (LM) representations and to investigate the potential of MLPs as efficient and scalable alternatives to GNNs. We extend traditional probing classifiers by incorporating a control module that allows for selective use of either the full GNN model or its decoupled components, specifically, the message-passing and feature-transformation operations.This modular approach isolates and assesses the individual contributions of these operations, avoiding confounding effects from the complete GNN architecture. Using the Edge Probing Suite, a diagnostic tool for evaluating the linguistic knowledge encoded in LMs, we find that MLPs, when used as feature-transformation modules, consistently improve the linguistic knowledge captured in LM representations across different architectures. They effectively encode both syntactic and semantic patterns. Similarly, GNNs that incorporate feature-transformation operations show beneficial effects. In contrast, models that rely solely on message-passing operations tend to underperform, often leading to negative impacts on probing task performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Graph...</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks, Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Explicit Structural Modeling, Probing Classifier</p></details> |

This article describes NuGraph2, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for low-level reconstruction of simulated neutrino interactions in a LArTPC detector. Simulated neutrino interactions in the MicroBooNE detector geometry are described as heterogeneous graphs, with energy depositions on each detector plane forming nodes on planar subgraphs. The network utilizes a multi-head attention message-passing mechanism to perform background filtering and semantic labelling on these graph nodes, identifying those associated with the primary physics interaction with 98.0\% efficiency and labelling them according to particle type with 94.9\% efficiency. The network operates directly on detector observables across multiple 2D representations, but utilizes a 3D-context-aware mechanism to encourage consistency between these representations. Model inference takes 0.12~s/event on a CPU, and 0.005s/event batched on a GPU. This architecture is designed to be a general-purpose solution for particle reconstruction in neutrino physics, with the potential for deployment across a broad range of detector technologies, and offers a core convolution engine that can be leveraged for a variety of tasks beyond the two described in this article.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 14 figures, published in Physical Review D</p></details> |

However, the irregular connectivity between vertices leads to inefficient neighbor aggregation, resulting in substantial irregular and coarse-grained DRAM accesses. This lack of data locality presents significant challenges for execution platforms, ultimately degrading performance. While previous accelerator designs have leveraged on-chip memory and data access scheduling strategies to address this issue, they still inevitably access features at irregular addresses from DRAM. In this work, we propose LiGNN, a hardware-based solution that improves data locality by applying dropout and merge techniques during neighbor aggregation to accelerate GNN training. Unlike conventional algorithm-level dropout methods that primarily aim to improve accuracy while overlooking hardware costs, LiGNN introduces a locality-aware feature dropout mechanism. This approach selectively drops node features with data locality awareness, effectively reducing irregular DRAM accesses without compromising model accuracy. Moreover, by leveraging detailed knowledge of memory layout and organization-including critical alignment constraints-LiGNN strategically merges memory accesses during neighbor aggregation at the DRAM row level, guided by GNN-level semantics. This optimization significantly improves data locality with minimal additional cost. Under the commonly adopted 0.5 dropout rate, LiGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering a 1.48~3.02x speedup, reducing DRAM accesses by 34%~55%, and lowering DRAM row activations by 59%~82%, all while maintaining model accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review in TPDS. extend version of DATE 2025</p></details> |

Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and struggle to capture temporal and structural dependencies in transaction networks. This paper proposes an Augmented Temporal-aware Graph Attention Network (ATGAT) that enhances detection performance through three modules: (1) designing an advanced temporal embedding module that fuses multi-scale time difference features with periodic position encoding; (2) constructing a temporal-aware triple attention mechanism that jointly optimizes structural, temporal, and global context attention; (3) employing weighted BCE loss to address class imbalance. Experiments on the Elliptic++ cryptocurrency dataset demonstrate that ATGAT achieves an AUC of 0.9130, representing a 9.2% improvement over the best traditional method XGBoost, 12.0% over GCN, and 10.0% over standard GAT. This method not only validates the enhancement effect of temporal awareness and triple attention mechanisms on graph neural networks, but also provides financial institutions with more reliable fraud detection tools, with its design principles generalizable to other temporal graph anomaly detection tasks.</p></details> |  |

| **[ScaleGNN: Towards Scalable Graph Neural Networks via Adaptive High-order Neighboring Feature Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15920v4)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance across diverse graph-based tasks by leveraging message passing to capture complex node relationships. However, when applied to large-scale real-world graphs, GNNs face two major challenges: First, it becomes increasingly difficult to ensure both scalability and efficiency, as the repeated aggregation of large neighborhoods leads to significant computational overhead; Second, the over-smoothing problem arises, where excessive or deep propagation makes node representations indistinguishable, severely hindering model expressiveness. To tackle these issues, we propose ScaleGNN, a novel framework that adaptively fuses multi-hop node features for both scalable and effective graph learning. First, we construct per-hop pure neighbor matrices that capture only the exclusive structural information at each hop, avoiding the redundancy of conventional aggregation. Then, an enhanced feature fusion strategy significantly balances low-order and high-order information, preserving both local detail and global correlations without incurring excessive complexity. To further reduce redundancy and over-smoothing, we introduce a Local Contribution Score (LCS)-based masking mechanism to filter out less relevant high-order neighbors, ensuring that only the most meaningful information is aggregated. In addition, learnable sparse constraints selectively integrate multi-hop valuable features, emphasizing the most informative high-order neighbors. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ScaleGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, highlighting its practical value for large-scale graph learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Devil's Hand: Data Poisoning Attacks to Locally Private Graph Learning Protocols](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09803v2)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in graph representation learning and have been applied to various domains. However, many real-world graphs contain sensitive personal information, such as user profiles in social networks, raising serious privacy concerns when graph learning is performed using GNNs. To address this issue, locally private graph learning protocols have gained considerable attention. These protocols leverage the privacy advantages of local differential privacy (LDP) and the effectiveness of GNN's message-passing in calibrating noisy data, offering strict privacy guarantees for users' local data while maintaining high utility (e.g., node classification accuracy) for graph learning. Despite these advantages, such protocols may be vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, a threat that has not been considered in previous research. Identifying and addressing these threats is crucial for ensuring the robustness and security of privacy-preserving graph learning frameworks. This work introduces the first data poisoning attack targeting locally private graph learning protocols. The attacker injects fake users into the protocol, manipulates these fake users to establish links with genuine users, and sends carefully crafted data to the server, ultimately compromising the utility of private graph learning. The effectiveness of the attack is demonstrated both theoretically and empirically. In addition, several defense strategies have also been explored, but their limited effectiveness highlights the need for more robust defenses.</p></details> |  |

However, naively appending large sets of heterogeneous descriptors often degrades performance on tasks sensitive to molecular shape or symmetry, and undermines interpretability. xChemAgents proposes a cooperative agent framework that injects physics-aware reasoning into multimodal property prediction. xChemAgents comprises two language-model-based agents: a Selector, which adaptively identifies a sparse, weighted subset of descriptors relevant to each target, and provides a natural language rationale; and a Validator, which enforces physical constraints such as unit consistency and scaling laws through iterative dialogue. On standard benchmark datasets, xChemAgents achieves up to a 22% reduction in mean absolute error over the state-of-the-art baselines, while producing faithful, human-interpretable explanations. Experiment results highlight the potential of cooperative, self-verifying agents to enhance both accuracy and transparency in foundation-model-driven materials science.

| **[A GREAT Architecture for Edge-Based Graph Problems Like TSP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16717v2)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the last years, many learning-based approaches have been proposed to tackle combinatorial optimization problems such as routing problems. Many of these approaches are based on graph neural networks (GNNs) or related transformers, operating on the Euclidean coordinates representing the routing problems. However, models operating on Euclidean coordinates are ill-suited for non-Euclidean, asymmetric problem instances that are often found in real-world settings. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel GNN-based and edge-focused neural model called Graph Edge Attention Network (GREAT). Using GREAT as an encoder to capture the properties of a routing problem instance, we build a reinforcement learning framework which we apply to Euclidean and non-Euclidean variants of vehicle routing problems such as Traveling Salesman Problem, Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem and Orienteering Problem. Our framework is among the first to tackle non-Euclidean variants of these problems and achieves competitive results among learning-based solvers.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

Distributed GNN frameworks and systems enhance the scalability of GNNs and accelerate model training, yet most are optimized for node classification. Their performance on link prediction remains underexplored. This paper demystifies distributed training of GNNs for link prediction by investigating the issue of performance degradation when each worker trains a GNN on its assigned partitioned subgraph without having access to the entire graph. We discover that the main sources of the issue come from not only the information loss caused by graph partitioning but also the ways of drawing negative samples during model training. While sharing the complete graph information with each worker resolves the issue and preserves link prediction accuracy, it incurs a high communication cost. We propose SpLPG, which effectively leverages graph sparsification to mitigate the issue of performance degradation at a reduced communication cost. Experiment results on several public real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpLPG, which reduces the communication overhead by up to about 80% while mostly preserving link prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE ICDCS 2025</p></details> |

Current robustness evaluations often rely on unrealistic synthetic perturbations and lack demonstrations on systematic analysis of different kinds of adversarial attack, which encompass both black-box and white-box scenarios. This work proposes a novel approach to enhance GNN robustness and generalization by employing Large Language Models (LLMs) in an agentic pipeline as simulated cybersecurity expert agents. These agents scrutinize graph structures derived from network flow data, identifying and potentially mitigating suspicious or adversarially perturbed elements before GNN processing. Our experiments, using a framework designed for realistic evaluation and testing with a variety of adversarial attacks including a dataset collected from physical testbed experiments, demonstrate that integrating LLM analysis can significantly improve the resilience of GNN-based NIDS against challenges, showcasing the potential of LLM agent as a complementary layer in intrusion detection architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Poste...</summary><p>Poster accepted at the 10th IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (Euro S&P 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Graph-Transformer Out-of-Distribution Generalization Abilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20575v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning on graphs has shown remarkable success across numerous applications, including social networks, bio-physics, traffic networks, and recommendation systems. Regardless of their successes, current methods frequently depend on the assumption that training and testing data share the same distribution, a condition rarely met in real-world scenarios. While graph-transformer (GT) backbones have recently outperformed traditional message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) in multiple in-distribution (ID) benchmarks, their effectiveness under distribution shifts remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address the challenge of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization for graph neural networks, with a special focus on the impact of backbone architecture. We systematically evaluate GT and hybrid backbones in OOD settings and compare them to MPNNs. To do so, we adapt several leading domain generalization (DG) algorithms to work with GTs and assess their performance on a benchmark designed to test a variety of distribution shifts. Our results reveal that GT and hybrid GT-MPNN backbones consistently demonstrate stronger generalization ability compared to MPNNs, even without specialized DG algorithms. Additionally, we propose a novel post-training analysis approach that compares the clustering structure of the entire ID and OOD test datasets, specifically examining domain alignment and class separation. Demonstrating its model-agnostic design, this approach not only provided meaningful insights into GT and MPNN backbones. It also shows promise for broader applicability to DG problems beyond graph learning, offering a deeper perspective on generalization abilities that goes beyond standard accuracy metrics. Together, our findings highlight the promise of graph-transformers for robust, real-world graph learning and set a new direction for future research in OOD generalization.</p></details> |  |

Our method integrates Laplacian-based signals into the learning process, allowing the model to effectively capture rich structural representations without relying on contrastive objectives or handcrafted augmentations. By focusing on positive alignment, LaplaceGNN achieves linear scaling while offering a simpler, more efficient, self-supervised alternative for graph neural networks, applicable across diverse domains. Our contributions are twofold: we precompute spectral augmentations through max-min centrality-guided optimization, enabling rich structural supervision without relying on handcrafted augmentations, then we integrate an adversarial bootstrapped training scheme that further strengthens feature learning and robustness. Our extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets show that LaplaceGNN achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art self-supervised graph methods, offering a promising direction for efficiently learning expressive graph representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Lapla...</summary><p>LaplaceGNN is a novel graph learning framework that employs a bootstrapped teacher-student architecture.

| **[Beyond Topological Self-Explainable GNNs: A Formal Explainability Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02719v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-Explainable Graph Neural Networks (SE-GNNs) are popular explainable-by-design GNNs, but their explanations' properties and limitations are not well understood. Our first contribution fills this gap by formalizing the explanations extracted by some popular SE-GNNs, referred to as Minimal Explanations (MEs), and comparing them to established notions of explanations, namely Prime Implicant (PI) and faithful explanations. Our analysis reveals that MEs match PI explanations for a restricted but significant family of tasks. In general, however, they can be less informative than PI explanations and are surprisingly misaligned with widely accepted notions of faithfulness. Although faithful and PI explanations are informative, they are intractable to find and we show that they can be prohibitively large. Given these observations, a natural choice is to augment SE-GNNs with alternative modalities of explanations taking care of SE-GNNs' limitations. To this end, we propose Dual-Channel GNNs that integrate a white-box rule extractor and a standard SE-GNN, adaptively combining both channels. Our experiments show that even a simple instantiation of Dual-Channel GNNs can recover succinct rules and perform on par or better than widely used SE-GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-Channel Multiplex Graph Neural Networks for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11624v5)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective recommender systems play a crucial role in accurately capturing user and item attributes that mirror individual preferences. Some existing recommendation techniques have started to shift their focus towards modeling various types of interactive relations between users and items in real-world recommendation scenarios, such as clicks, marking favorites, and purchases on online shopping platforms. Nevertheless, these approaches still grapple with two significant challenges: (1) Insufficient modeling and exploitation of the impact of various behavior patterns formed by multiplex relations between users and items on representation learning, and (2) ignoring the effect of different relations within behavior patterns on the target relation in recommender system scenarios. In this work, we introduce a novel recommendation framework, Dual-Channel Multiplex Graph Neural Network (DCMGNN), which addresses the aforementioned challenges. It incorporates an explicit behavior pattern representation learner to capture the behavior patterns composed of multiplex user-item interactive relations, and includes a relation chain representation learner and a relation chain-aware encoder to discover the impact of various auxiliary relations on the target relation, the dependencies between different relations, and mine the appropriate order of relations in a behavior pattern. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our DCMGNN surpasses various state-of-the-art recommendation methods. It outperforms the best baselines by 10.06% and 12.15% on average across all datasets in terms of Recall@10 and NDCG@10, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Directed Link Prediction using GNN with Local and Global Feature Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20235v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link prediction is a classical problem in graph analysis with many practical applications. For directed graphs, recently developed deep learning approaches typically analyze node similarities through contrastive learning and aggregate neighborhood information through graph convolutions. In this work, we propose a novel graph neural network (GNN) framework to fuse feature embedding with community information. We theoretically demonstrate that such hybrid features can improve the performance of directed link prediction. To utilize such features efficiently, we also propose an approach to transform input graphs into directed line graphs so that nodes in the transformed graph can aggregate more information during graph convolutions. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in most cases when 30%, 40%, 50%, and 60% of the connected links are used as training data, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[GNN's Uncertainty Quantification using Self-Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20046v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in the healthcare domain. However, what remained challenging is quantifying the predictive uncertainty of GNNs, which is an important aspect of trustworthiness in clinical settings. While Bayesian and ensemble methods can be used to quantify uncertainty, they are computationally expensive. Additionally, the disagreement metric used by ensemble methods to compute uncertainty cannot capture the diversity of models in an ensemble network. In this paper, we propose a novel method, based on knowledge distillation, to quantify GNNs' uncertainty more efficiently and with higher precision. We apply self-distillation, where the same network serves as both the teacher and student models, thereby avoiding the need to train several networks independently. To ensure the impact of self-distillation, we develop an uncertainty metric that captures the diverse nature of the network by assigning different weights to each GNN classifier. We experimentally evaluate the precision, performance, and ability of our approach in distinguishing out-of-distribution data on two graph datasets: MIMIC-IV and Enzymes. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively capture the predictive uncertainty of the model while having performance similar to that of the MC Dropout and ensemble methods.

| **[Automated Generation of Diverse Courses of Actions for Multi-Agent Operations using Binary Optimization and Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20031v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operations in disaster response, search \& rescue, and military missions that involve multiple agents demand automated processes to support the planning of the courses of action (COA). Moreover, traverse-affecting changes in the environment (rain, snow, blockades, etc.) may impact the expected performance of a COA, making it desirable to have a pool of COAs that are diverse in task distributions across agents. Further, variations in agent capabilities, which could be human crews and/or autonomous systems, present practical opportunities and computational challenges to the planning process. This paper presents a new theoretical formulation and computational framework to generate such diverse pools of COAs for operations with soft variations in agent-task compatibility. Key to the problem formulation is a graph abstraction of the task space and the pool of COAs itself to quantify its diversity. Formulating the COAs as a centralized multi-robot task allocation problem, a genetic algorithm is used for (order-ignoring) allocations of tasks to each agent that jointly maximize diversity within the COA pool and overall compatibility of the agent-task mappings. A graph neural network is trained using a policy gradient approach to then perform single agent task sequencing in each COA, which maximizes completion rates adaptive to task features. Our tests of the COA generation process in a simulated environment demonstrate significant performance gain over a random walk baseline, small optimality gap in task sequencing, and execution time of about 50 minutes to plan up to 20 COAs for 5 agent/100 task operations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Machine Learning Algorithms using Path Signatures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17634v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interface between stochastic analysis and machine learning is a rapidly evolving field, with path signatures - iterated integrals that provide faithful, hierarchical representations of paths - offering a principled and universal feature map for sequential and structured data. Rooted in rough path theory, path signatures are invariant to reparameterization and well-suited for modelling evolving dynamics, long-range dependencies, and irregular sampling - common challenges in real-world time series and graph data. This thesis investigates how to harness the expressive power of path signatures within scalable machine learning pipelines. It introduces a suite of models that combine theoretical robustness with computational efficiency, bridging rough path theory with probabilistic modelling, deep learning, and kernel methods. Key contributions include: Gaussian processes with signature kernel-based covariance functions for uncertainty-aware time series modelling; the Seq2Tens framework, which employs low-rank tensor structure in the weight space for scalable deep modelling of long-range dependencies; and graph-based models where expected signatures over graphs induce hypo-elliptic diffusion processes, offering expressive yet tractable alternatives to standard graph neural networks. Further developments include Random Fourier Signature Features, a scalable kernel approximation with theoretical guarantees, and Recurrent Sparse Spectrum Signature Gaussian Processes, which combine Gaussian processes, signature kernels, and random features with a principled forgetting mechanism for multi-horizon time series forecasting with adaptive context length. We hope this thesis serves as both a methodological toolkit and a conceptual bridge, and provides a useful reference for the current state of the art in scalable, signature-based learning for sequential and structured data.</p></details> | PhD thesis |
| **[Learning-aided Bigraph Matching Approach to Multi-Crew Restoration of Damaged Power Networks Coupled with Road Transportation Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19703v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The resilience of critical infrastructure networks (CINs) after disruptions, such as those caused by natural hazards, depends on both the speed of restoration and the extent to which operational functionality can be regained. Allocating resources for restoration is a combinatorial optimal planning problem that involves determining which crews will repair specific network nodes and in what order. This paper presents a novel graph-based formulation that merges two interconnected graphs, representing crew and transportation nodes and power grid nodes, into a single heterogeneous graph. To enable efficient planning, graph reinforcement learning (GRL) is integrated with bigraph matching. GRL is utilized to design the incentive function for assigning crews to repair tasks based on the graph-abstracted state of the environment, ensuring generalization across damage scenarios. Two learning techniques are employed: a graph neural network trained using Proximal Policy Optimization and another trained via Neuroevolution. The learned incentive functions inform a bipartite graph that links crews to repair tasks, enabling weighted maximum matching for crew-to-task allocations. An efficient simulation environment that pre-computes optimal node-to-node path plans is used to train the proposed restoration planning methods. An IEEE 8500-bus power distribution test network coupled with a 21 square km transportation network is used as the case study, with scenarios varying in terms of numbers of damaged nodes, depots, and crews. Results demonstrate the approach's generalizability and scalability across scenarios, with learned policies providing 3-fold better performance than random policies, while also outperforming optimization-based solutions in both computation time (by several orders of magnitude) and power restored.</p></details> | IDETC 2025 |
| **[Higher-Order Graph Databases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19661v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in graph databases (GDBs) have been driving interest in large-scale analytics, yet current systems fail to support higher-order (HO) interactions beyond first-order (one-hop) relations, which are crucial for tasks such as subgraph counting, polyadic modeling, and HO graph learning. We address this by introducing a new class of systems, higher-order graph databases (HO-GDBs) that use lifting and lowering paradigms to seamlessly extend traditional GDBs with HO. We provide a theoretical analysis of OLTP and OLAP queries, ensuring correctness, scalability, and ACID compliance. We implement a lightweight, modular, and parallelizable HO-GDB prototype that offers native support for hypergraphs, node-tuples, subgraphs, and other HO structures under a unified API. The prototype scales to large HO OLTP & OLAP workloads and shows how HO improves analytical tasks, for example enhancing accuracy of graph neural networks within a GDB by 44%. Our work ensures low latency and high query throughput, and generalizes both ACID-compliant and eventually consistent systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast and Distributed Equivariant Graph Neural Networks by Virtual Node Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19482v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse scientific applications. However, existing approaches face critical efficiency challenges when scaling to large geometric graphs and suffer significant performance degradation when the input graphs are sparsified for computational tractability. To address these limitations, we introduce FastEGNN and DistEGNN, two novel enhancements to equivariant GNNs for large-scale geometric graphs. FastEGNN employs a key innovation: a small ordered set of virtual nodes that effectively approximates the large unordered graph of real nodes. Specifically, we implement distinct message passing and aggregation mechanisms for different virtual nodes to ensure mutual distinctiveness, and minimize Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between virtual and real coordinates to achieve global distributedness. This design enables FastEGNN to maintain high accuracy while efficiently processing large-scale sparse graphs. For extremely large-scale geometric graphs, we present DistEGNN, a distributed extension where virtual nodes act as global bridges between subgraphs in different devices, maintaining consistency while dramatically reducing memory and computational overhead. We comprehensively evaluate our models across four challenging domains: N-body systems (100 nodes), protein dynamics (800 nodes), Water-3D (8,000 nodes), and our new Fluid113K benchmark (113,000 nodes). Results demonstrate superior efficiency and performance, establishing new capabilities in large-scale equivariant graph learning.

However, their performance, confidence, and trustworthiness are often limited by the inherent randomness in data and the challenges of accurately modeling real-world complexities. There has been increased interest in developing uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques tailored to graphical models. In this survey, we comprehensively examine existing works on UQ for graphical models, focusing on key aspects such as the sources, representation, handling, and evaluation of uncertainty. This survey distinguishes itself from most existing UQ surveys by specifically concentrating on UQ in graphical models, including probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). After reviewing sources of uncertainty, we organize the work using two high-level dimensions: uncertainty representation and uncertainty handling. By offering a comprehensive overview of the current landscape, including both established methodologies and emerging trends, we aim to bridge gaps in understanding key challenges and opportunities in UQ for graphical models, hoping to inspire researchers working on graphical models or uncertainty quantification to make further advancements at the cross of the two fields.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Extreme Operating Condition Search for Online Relay Setting Calculation in Renewable Power Systems Based on Parallel Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19289v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Extreme Operating Conditions Search (EOCS) problem is one of the key problems in relay setting calculation, which is used to ensure that the setting values of protection relays can adapt to the changing operating conditions of power systems over a period of time after deployment. The high penetration of renewable energy and the wide application of inverter-based resources make the operating conditions of renewable power systems more volatile, which urges the adoption of the online relay setting calculation strategy. However, the computation speed of existing EOCS methods based on local enumeration, heuristic algorithms, and mathematical programming cannot meet the efficiency requirement of online relay setting calculation. To reduce the time overhead, this paper, for the first time, proposes an efficient deep learning-based EOCS method suitable for online relay setting calculation. First, the power system information is formulated as four layers, i.e., a component parameter layer, a topological connection layer, an electrical distance layer, and a graph distance layer, which are fed into a parallel graph neural network (PGNN) model for feature extraction. Then, the four feature layers corresponding to each node are spliced and stretched, and then fed into the decision network to predict the extreme operating condition of the system. Finally, the proposed PGNN method is validated on the modified IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus test systems, where some of the synchronous generators are replaced by renewable generation units. The nonlinear fault characteristics of renewables are fully considered when computing fault currents. The experiment results show that the proposed PGNN method achieves higher accuracy than the existing methods in solving the EOCS problem. Meanwhile, it also provides greater improvements in online computation time.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Batch-Insensitive Dynamic GNN Approach to Address Temporal Discontinuity in Graph Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19282v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In dynamic graphs, preserving temporal continuity is critical. However, Memory-based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (MDGNNs) trained with large batches often disrupt event sequences, leading to temporal information loss. This discontinuity not only deteriorates temporal modeling but also hinders optimization by increasing the difficulty of parameter convergence. Our theoretical study quantifies this through a Lipschitz upper bound, showing that large batch sizes enlarge the parameter search space. In response, we propose BADGNN, a novel batch-agnostic framework consisting of two core components: (1) Temporal Lipschitz Regularization (TLR) to control parameter search space expansion, and (2) Adaptive Attention Adjustment (A3) to alleviate attention distortion induced by both regularization and batching. Empirical results on three benchmark datasets show that BADGNN maintains strong performance while enabling significantly larger batch sizes and faster training compared to TGN.

In this work, we use graph neural networks to investigate \emph{quiver mutation} -- an operation that transforms one quiver (or directed multigraph) into another -- which is central to the theory of cluster algebras with deep connections to geometry, topology, and physics. In the study of cluster algebras, the question of \emph{mutation equivalence} is of fundamental concern: given two quivers, can one efficiently determine if one quiver can be transformed into the other through a sequence of mutations? In this paper, we use graph neural networks and AI explainability techniques to independently discover mutation equivalence criteria for quivers of type $\tilde{D}$. Along the way, we also show that even without explicit training to do so, our model captures structure within its hidden representation that allows us to reconstruct known criteria from type $D$, adding to the growing evidence that modern machine learning models are capable of learning abstract and parsimonious rules from mathematical data.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Automating Traffic Monitoring with SHM Sensor Networks via Vision-Supervised Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19023v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bridges, as critical components of civil infrastructure, are increasingly affected by deterioration, making reliable traffic monitoring essential for assessing their remaining service life. Among operational loads, traffic load plays a pivotal role, and recent advances in deep learning - particularly in computer vision (CV) - have enabled progress toward continuous, automated monitoring. However, CV-based approaches suffer from limitations, including privacy concerns and sensitivity to lighting conditions, while traditional non-vision-based methods often lack flexibility in deployment and validation. To bridge this gap, we propose a fully automated deep-learning pipeline for continuous traffic monitoring using structural health monitoring (SHM) sensor networks. Our approach integrates CV-assisted high-resolution dataset generation with supervised training and inference, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture the spatial structure and interdependence of sensor data. By transferring knowledge from CV outputs to SHM sensors, the proposed framework enables sensor networks to achieve comparable accuracy of vision-based systems, with minimal human intervention. Applied to accelerometer and strain gauge data in a real-world case study, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with classification accuracies of 99% for light vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate how a state-augmented graph neural network (GNN) parametrization for the resource allocation policy circumvents the drawbacks of the ubiquitous dual subgradient methods by representing the network configurations (or states) as graphs and viewing dual variables as dynamic inputs to the model, viewed as graph signals supported over the graphs. Lagrangian maximizing state-augmented policies are learned during the offline training phase, and the dual variables evolve through gradient updates while executing the learned state-augmented policies during the inference phase. Our main contributions are to illustrate how near-optimal initialization of dual multipliers for faster inference can be accomplished with dual variable regression, leveraging a secondary GNN parametrization, and how maximization of the Lagrangian over the multipliers sampled from the dual descent dynamics substantially improves the training of state-augmented models. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm with extensive numerical experiments in a case study of transmit power control. Finally, we prove a convergence result and an exponential probability bound on the excursions of the dual function (iterate) optimality gaps.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE TSP for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[SaGIF: Improving Individual Fairness in Graph Neural Networks via Similarity Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18696v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Individual fairness (IF) in graph neural networks (GNNs), which emphasizes the need for similar individuals should receive similar outcomes from GNNs, has been a critical issue. Despite its importance, research in this area has been largely unexplored in terms of (1) a clear understanding of what induces individual unfairness in GNNs and (2) a comprehensive consideration of identifying similar individuals. To bridge these gaps, we conduct a preliminary analysis to explore the underlying reason for individual unfairness and observe correlations between IF and similarity consistency, a concept introduced to evaluate the discrepancy in identifying similar individuals based on graph structure versus node features. Inspired by our observations, we introduce two metrics to assess individual similarity from two distinct perspectives: topology fusion and feature fusion. Building upon these metrics, we propose Similarity-aware GNNs for Individual Fairness, named SaGIF. The key insight behind SaGIF is the integration of individual similarities by independently learning similarity representations, leading to an improvement of IF in GNNs. Our experiments on several real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed metrics and SaGIF. Specifically, SaGIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art IF methods while maintaining utility performance. Code is available at: https://github.com/ZzoomD/SaGIF.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Federated Learning from Molecules to Processes: A Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18525v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a perspective on federated learning in chemical engineering that envisions collaborative efforts in machine learning (ML) developments within the chemical industry. Large amounts of chemical and process data are proprietary to chemical companies and are therefore locked in data silos, hindering the training of ML models on large data sets in chemical engineering. Recently, the concept of federated learning has gained increasing attention in ML research, enabling organizations to jointly train machine learning models without disclosure of their individual data. We discuss potential applications of federated learning in several fields of chemical engineering, from the molecular to the process scale. In addition, we apply federated learning in two exemplary case studies that simulate practical scenarios of multiple chemical companies holding proprietary data sets: (i) prediction of binary mixture activity coefficients with graph neural networks and (ii) system identification of a distillation column with autoencoders. Our results indicate that ML models jointly trained with federated learning yield significantly higher accuracy than models trained by each chemical company individually and can perform similarly to models trained on combined datasets from all companies. Federated learning has therefore great potential to advance ML models in chemical engineering while respecting corporate data privacy, making it promising for future industrial applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[PERSCEN: Learning Personalized Interaction Pattern and Scenario Preference for Multi-Scenario Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18382v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the expansion of business scales and scopes on online platforms, multi-scenario matching has become a mainstream solution to reduce maintenance costs and alleviate data sparsity. The key to effective multi-scenario recommendation lies in capturing both user preferences shared across all scenarios and scenario-aware preferences specific to each scenario. However, existing methods often overlook user-specific modeling, limiting the generation of personalized user representations. To address this, we propose PERSCEN, an innovative approach that incorporates user-specific modeling into multi-scenario matching. PERSCEN constructs a user-specific feature graph based on user characteristics and employs a lightweight graph neural network to capture higher-order interaction patterns, enabling personalized extraction of preferences shared across scenarios. Additionally, we leverage vector quantization techniques to distil scenario-aware preferences from users' behavior sequence within individual scenarios, facilitating user-specific and scenario-aware preference modeling. To enhance efficient and flexible information transfer, we introduce a progressive scenario-aware gated linear unit that allows fine-grained, low-latency fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PERSCEN outperforms existing methods. Further efficiency analysis confirms that PERSCEN effectively balances performance with computational cost, ensuring its practicality for real-world industrial systems.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

In this work, we explore how robots equipped with electronic skin can recognize tactile gestures and interpret them as human commands. We developed a modular robot E-skin, composed of multiple irregularly shaped skin patches, which can be assembled to cover the robot's body while capturing real-time pressure and pose data from thousands of sensing points. To process this information, we propose an equivariant graph neural network-based recognizer that efficiently and accurately classifies diverse tactile gestures, including poke, grab, stroke, and double-pat. By mapping the recognized gestures to predefined robot actions, we enable intuitive human-robot interaction purely through tactile input.</p></details> |  |
| **[Call Me Maybe: Enhancing JavaScript Call Graph Construction using Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18191v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static analysis plays a key role in finding bugs, including security issues. A critical step in static analysis is building accurate call graphs that model function calls in a program. However, due to hard-to-analyze language features, existing call graph construction algorithms for JavaScript are neither sound nor complete. Prior work shows that even advanced solutions produce false edges and miss valid ones. In this work, we assist these tools by identifying missed call edges. Our main idea is to frame the problem as link prediction on full program graphs, using a rich representation with multiple edge types. Our approach, GRAPHIA, leverages recent advances in graph neural networks to model non-local relationships between code elements. Concretely, we propose representing JavaScript programs using a combination of syntactic- and semantic-based edges. GRAPHIA can learn from imperfect labels, including static call edges from existing tools and dynamic edges from tests, either from the same or different projects. Because call graphs are sparse, standard machine learning metrics like ROC are not suitable. Instead, we evaluate GRAPHIA by ranking function definitions for each unresolved call site. We conduct a large-scale evaluation on 50 popular JavaScript libraries with 163K call edges (150K static and 13K dynamic). GRAPHIA builds program graphs with 6.6M structural and 386K semantic edges. It ranks the correct target as the top candidate in over 42% of unresolved cases and within the top 5 in 72% of cases, reducing the manual effort needed for analysis. Our results show that learning-based methods can improve the recall of JavaScript call graph construction. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply GNN-based link prediction to full multi-file program graphs for interprocedural analysis.</p></details> |  |

For non-Euclidean data, e.g., graphs, that particularly involves topological structures, one important aspect neglected by prior studies is how machine learning models generalize under topological shifts. This paper proposes Advective Diffusion Transformer (AdvDIFFormer), a physics-inspired graph Transformer model designed to address this challenge. The model is derived from advective diffusion equations which describe a class of continuous message passing process with observed and latent topological structures. We show that AdvDIFFormer has provable capability for controlling generalization error with topological shifts, which in contrast cannot be guaranteed by graph diffusion models, i.e., the generalized formulation of common graph neural networks in continuous space. Empirically, the model demonstrates superiority in various predictive tasks across information networks, molecular screening and protein interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Rumor Detection on Social Media with Reinforcement Learning-based Key Propagation Graph Generator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13094v2)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spread of rumors on social media, particularly during significant events like the US elections and the COVID-19 pandemic, poses a serious threat to social stability and public health. Current rumor detection methods primarily rely on propagation graphs to improve the model performance. However, the effectiveness of these methods is often compromised by noisy and irrelevant structures in the propagation process. To tackle this issue, techniques such as weight adjustment and data augmentation have been proposed. However, they depend heavily on rich original propagation structures, limiting their effectiveness in handling rumors that lack sufficient propagation information, especially in the early stages of dissemination. In this work, we introduce the Key Propagation Graph Generator (KPG), a novel reinforcement learning-based framework, that generates contextually coherent and informative propagation patterns for events with insufficient topology information and identifies significant substructures in events with redundant and noisy propagation structures. KPG comprises two key components: the Candidate Response Generator (CRG) and the Ending Node Selector (ENS). CRG learns latent variable distributions from refined propagation patterns to eliminate noise and generate new candidates for ENS, while ENS identifies the most influential substructures in propagation graphs and provides training data for CRG. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end framework that utilizes rewards derived from a pre-trained graph neural network to guide the training process. The resulting key propagation graphs are then employed in downstream rumor detection tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrate that KPG outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Cancer Gene Identification through Graph Anomaly Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17240v2)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in integrating protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks for identifying cancer genes in recent studies. However, due to the insufficient modeling of the biological information in PPI networks, more faithfully depiction of complex protein interaction patterns for cancer genes within the graph structure remains largely unexplored. This study takes a pioneering step toward bridging biological anomalies in protein interactions caused by cancer genes to statistical graph anomaly. We find a unique graph anomaly exhibited by cancer genes, namely weight heterogeneity, which manifests as significantly higher variance in edge weights of cancer gene nodes within the graph. Additionally, from the spectral perspective, we demonstrate that the weight heterogeneity could lead to the "flattening out" of spectral energy, with a concentration towards the extremes of the spectrum. Building on these insights, we propose the HIerarchical-Perspective Graph Neural Network (HIPGNN) that not only determines spectral energy distribution variations on the spectral perspective, but also perceives detailed protein interaction context on the spatial perspective. Extensive experiments are conducted on two reprocessed datasets STRINGdb and CPDB, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of HIPGNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[SliceGX: Layer-wise GNN Explanation with Model-slicing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17977v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the trustworthiness of graph neural networks (GNNs) as black-box models requires effective explanation methods. Existing GNN explanations typically apply input perturbations to identify subgraphs that are responsible for the occurrence of the final output of GNNs. However, such approaches lack finer-grained, layer-wise analysis of how intermediate representations contribute to the final result, capabilities that are crucial for model diagnosis and architecture optimization. This paper introduces SliceGX, a novel GNN explanation approach that generates explanations at specific GNN layers in a progressive manner. Given a GNN M, a set of selected intermediate layers, and a target layer, SliceGX automatically segments M into layer blocks ("model slice") and discovers high-quality explanatory subgraphs in each layer block that clarifies the occurrence of output of M at the targeted layer. Although finding such layer-wise explanations is computationally challenging, we develop efficient algorithms and optimization techniques that incrementally generate and maintain these subgraphs with provable approximation guarantees. Additionally, SliceGX offers a SPARQL-like query interface, providing declarative access and search capacities for the generated explanations. Through experiments on large real-world graphs and representative GNN architectures, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of SliceGX, and illustrate its practical utility in supporting model debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling Molecular Moieties through Hierarchical Grad-CAM Graph Explainability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01744v5)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Virtual Screening (VS) has become an essential tool in drug discovery, enabling the rapid and cost-effective identification of potential bioactive molecules. Among recent advancements, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained prominence for their ability to model complex molecular structures using graph-based representations. However, the integration of explainable methods to elucidate the specific contributions of molecular substructures to biological activity remains a significant challenge. This limitation hampers both the interpretability of predictive models and the rational design of novel therapeutics. Results: We trained 20 GNN models on a dataset of small molecules with the goal of predicting their activity on 20 distinct protein targets from the Kinase family. These classifiers achieved state-of-the-art performance in virtual screening tasks, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness on different targets. Building upon these models, we implemented the Hierarchical Grad-CAM graph Explainer (HGE) framework, enabling an in-depth analysis of the molecular moieties driving protein-ligand binding stabilization. HGE exploits Grad-CAM explanations at the atom, ring, and whole-molecule levels, leveraging the message-passing mechanism to highlight the most relevant chemical moieties. Validation against experimental data from the literature confirmed the ability of the explainer to recognize a molecular pattern of drugs and correctly annotate them to the known target. Conclusion: Our approach may represent a valid support to shorten both the screening and the hit discovery process. Detailed knowledge of the molecular substructures that play a role in the binding process can help the computational chemist to gain insights into the structure optimization, as well as in drug repurposing tasks.</p></details> |  |

Supply chains are inherently graph-like, making them ideal for GNN methodologies, which can optimize and solve complex problems. The barriers include a lack of proper conceptual foundations, familiarity with graph applications in SCM, and real-world benchmark datasets for GNN-based supply chain research. To address this, we discuss and connect supply chains with graph structures for effective GNN application, providing detailed formulations, examples, mathematical definitions, and task guidelines. Additionally, we present a multi-perspective real-world benchmark dataset from a leading FMCG company in Bangladesh, focusing on supply chain planning. We discuss various supply chain tasks using GNNs and benchmark several state-of-the-art models on homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs across six supply chain analytics tasks. Our analysis shows that GNN-based models consistently outperform statistical Machine Learning and other Deep Learning models by around 10-30% in regression, 10-30% in classification and detection tasks, and 15-40% in anomaly detection tasks on designated metrics. With this work, we lay the groundwork for solving supply chain problems using GNNs, supported by conceptual discussions, methodological insights, and a comprehensive dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 Pa...</summary><p>27 Pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2401.15299</p></details> |
| **[TROJAN-GUARD: Hardware Trojans Detection Using GNN in RTL Designs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17894v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chip manufacturing is a complex process, and to achieve a faster time to market, an increasing number of untrusted third-party tools and designs from around the world are being utilized. The use of these untrusted third party intellectual properties (IPs) and tools increases the risk of adversaries inserting hardware trojans (HTs). The covert nature of HTs poses significant threats to cyberspace, potentially leading to severe consequences for national security, the economy, and personal privacy. Many graph neural network (GNN)-based HT detection methods have been proposed. However, they perform poorly on larger designs because they rely on training with smaller designs. Additionally, these methods do not explore different GNN models that are well-suited for HT detection or provide efficient training and inference processes. We propose a novel framework that generates graph embeddings for large designs (e.g., RISC-V) and incorporates various GNN models tailored for HT detection. Furthermore, our framework introduces domain-specific techniques for efficient training and inference by implementing model quantization. Model quantization reduces the precision of the weights, lowering the computational requirements, enhancing processing speed without significantly affecting detection accuracy. We evaluate our framework using a custom dataset, and our results demonstrate a precision of 98.66% and a recall (true positive rate) of 92.30%, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in detecting hardware trojans in large-scale chip designs</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Unified Textual Graph Framework for Spectral Reasoning via Physical and Chemical Information Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17761v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the limitations of current spectral analysis methods-such as reliance on single-modality data, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability-we propose a novel multi-modal spectral analysis framework that integrates prior knowledge graphs with Large Language Models. Our method explicitly bridges physical spectral measurements and chemical structural semantics by representing them in a unified Textual Graph format, enabling flexible, interpretable, and generalizable spectral understanding. Raw spectra are first transformed into TAGs, where nodes and edges are enriched with textual attributes describing both spectral properties and chemical context. These are then merged with relevant prior knowledge-including functional groups and molecular graphs-to form a Task Graph that incorporates "Prompt Nodes" supporting LLM-based contextual reasoning. A Graph Neural Network further processes this structure to complete downstream tasks. This unified design enables seamless multi-modal integration and automated feature decoding with minimal manual annotation. Our framework achieves consistently high performance across multiple spectral analysis tasks, including node-level, edge-level, and graph-level classification. It demonstrates robust generalization in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, highlighting its effectiveness in learning from limited data and supporting in-context reasoning. This work establishes a scalable and interpretable foundation for LLM-driven spectral analysis, unifying physical and chemical modalities for scientific applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[G-Adaptivity: optimised graph-based mesh relocation for finite element methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04516v3)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel, and effective, approach to achieve optimal mesh relocation in finite element methods (FEMs). The cost and accuracy of FEMs is critically dependent on the choice of mesh points. Mesh relocation (r-adaptivity) seeks to optimise the mesh geometry to obtain the best solution accuracy at given computational budget. Classical r-adaptivity relies on the solution of a separate nonlinear "meshing" PDE to determine mesh point locations. This incurs significant cost at remeshing, and relies on estimates that relate interpolation- and FEM-error. Recent machine learning approaches have focused on the construction of fast surrogates for such classical methods. Instead, our new approach trains a graph neural network (GNN) to determine mesh point locations by directly minimising the FE solution error from the PDE system Firedrake to achieve higher solution accuracy. Our GNN architecture closely aligns the mesh solution space to that of classical meshing methodologies, thus replacing classical estimates for optimality with a learnable strategy. This allows for rapid and robust training and results in an extremely efficient and effective GNN approach to online r-adaptivity. Our method outperforms both classical, and prior ML, approaches to r-adaptive meshing. In particular, it achieves lower FE solution error, whilst retaining the significant speed-up over classical methods observed in prior ML work.</p></details> |  |
| **[CEGA: A Cost-Effective Approach for Graph-Based Model Extraction and Acquisition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17709v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable utility across diverse applications, and their growing complexity has made Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) a viable platform for scalable deployment. However, this accessibility also exposes GNN to serious security threats, most notably model extraction attacks (MEAs), in which adversaries strategically query a deployed model to construct a high-fidelity replica. In this work, we evaluate the vulnerability of GNNs to MEAs and explore their potential for cost-effective model acquisition in non-adversarial research settings. Importantly, adaptive node querying strategies can also serve a critical role in research, particularly when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming. By selectively sampling informative nodes, researchers can train high-performing GNNs with minimal supervision, which is particularly valuable in domains such as biomedicine, where annotations often require expert input. To address this, we propose a node querying strategy tailored to a highly practical yet underexplored scenario, where bulk queries are prohibited, and only a limited set of initial nodes is available. Our approach iteratively refines the node selection mechanism over multiple learning cycles, leveraging historical feedback to improve extraction efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmark graph datasets demonstrate our superiority over comparable baselines on accuracy, fidelity, and F1 score under strict query-size constraints. These results highlight both the susceptibility of deployed GNNs to extraction attacks and the promise of ethical, efficient GNN acquisition methods to support low-resource research environments.</p></details> |  |

Current methods often focus on detection accuracy but neglect response time, which is critical in time-sensitive driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce real-time anomaly detection for autonomous driving, prioritizing both minimal response time and high accuracy. We propose a novel multimodal asynchronous hybrid network that combines event streams from event cameras with image data from RGB cameras. Our network utilizes the high temporal resolution of event cameras through an asynchronous Graph Neural Network and integrates it with spatial features extracted by a CNN from RGB images. This combination effectively captures both the temporal dynamics and spatial details of the driving environment, enabling swift and precise anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and response time, achieving millisecond-level real-time performance.</p></details> | ICML 2025 Spotlight |

While a related task, audio fingerprinting, has made significant progress in accurately retrieving musical content under "real world" (noisy, reverberant) conditions, ASID systems struggle to identify samples that have undergone musical modifications. Thus, a system robust to common music production transformations such as time-stretching, pitch-shifting, effects processing, and underlying or overlaying music is an important open challenge. In this work, we propose a lightweight and scalable encoding architecture employing a Graph Neural Network within a contrastive learning framework. Our model uses only 9% of the trainable parameters compared to the current state-of-the-art system while achieving comparable performance, reaching a mean average precision (mAP) of 44.2%. To enhance retrieval quality, we introduce a two-stage approach consisting of an initial coarse similarity search for candidate selection, followed by a cross-attention classifier that rejects irrelevant matches and refines the ranking of retrieved candidates - an essential capability absent in prior models. In addition, because queries in real-world applications are often short in duration, we benchmark our system for short queries using new fine-grained annotations for the Sample100 dataset, which we publish as part of this work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) 2025</p></details> |

However, these methods often suffer from computational inefficiency and tend to provide suboptimal partitioning schemes. To address this problem more effectively, we analyze the weight coupling problem from a novel perspective, which primarily stems from distinct modules in succeeding layers imposing conflicting gradient directions on the preceding layer modules. Based on this perspective, we propose the Gradient Contribution (GC) method that efficiently computes the cosine similarity of gradient directions among modules by decomposing the Vector-Jacobian Product during supernet backpropagation. Subsequently, the modules with conflicting gradient directions are allocated to distinct sub-supernets while similar ones are grouped together. To assess the advantages of GC and address the limitations of existing Graph Neural Architecture Search methods, which are limited to searching a single type of Graph Neural Networks (Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) or Graph Transformers (GTs)), we propose the Unified Graph Neural Architecture Search (UGAS) framework, which explores optimal combinations of MPNNs and GTs. The experimental results demonstrate that GC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in supernet partitioning quality and time efficiency. In addition, the architectures searched by UGAS+GC outperform both the manually designed GNNs and those obtained by existing NAS methods. Finally, ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of all proposed methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2025</p></details> |

This paper addresses this issue by introducing initialization methods that enhance signal propagation (SP) within GNNs. We propose three key metrics for effective SP in GNNs: forward propagation, backward propagation, and graph embedding variation (GEV). While the first two metrics derive from classical SP theory, the third is specifically designed for GNNs. We theoretically demonstrate that a broad range of commonly used initialization methods for GNNs, which exhibit performance degradation with increasing depth, fail to control these three metrics simultaneously. To deal with this limitation, a direct exploitation of the SP analysis--searching for weight initialization variances that optimize the three metrics--is shown to significantly enhance the SP in deep GCNs. This approach is called Signal Propagation on Graph-guided Initialization (SPoGInit). Our experiments demonstrate that SPoGInit outperforms commonly used initialization methods on various tasks and architectures. Notably, SPoGInit enables performance improvements as GNNs deepen, which represents a significant advancement in addressing depth-related challenges and highlights the validity and effectiveness of the SP analysis framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in TMLR (2025)</p></details> |
| **[SlepNet: Spectral Subgraph Representation Learning for Neural Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16602v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks have been useful in machine learning on graph-structured data, particularly for node classification and some types of graph classification tasks. However, they have had limited use in representing patterning of signals over graphs. Patterning of signals over graphs and in subgraphs carries important information in many domains including neuroscience. Neural signals are spatiotemporally patterned, high dimensional and difficult to decode. Graph signal processing and associated GCN models utilize the graph Fourier transform and are unable to efficiently represent spatially or spectrally localized signal patterning on graphs. Wavelet transforms have shown promise here, but offer non-canonical representations and cannot be tightly confined to subgraphs. Here we propose SlepNet, a novel GCN architecture that uses Slepian bases rather than graph Fourier harmonics. In SlepNet, the Slepian harmonics optimally concentrate signal energy on specifically relevant subgraphs that are automatically learned with a mask. Thus, they can produce canonical and highly resolved representations of neural activity, focusing energy of harmonics on areas of the brain which are activated. We evaluated SlepNet across three fMRI datasets, spanning cognitive and visual tasks, and two traffic dynamics datasets, comparing its performance against conventional GNNs and graph signal processing constructs. SlepNet outperforms the baselines in all datasets. Moreover, the extracted representations of signal patterns from SlepNet offers more resolution in distinguishing between similar patterns, and thus represent brain signaling transients as informative trajectories. Here we have shown that these extracted trajectory representations can be used for other downstream untrained tasks. Thus we establish that SlepNet is useful both for prediction and representation learning in spatiotemporal data.</p></details> |  |

While conventional approaches, such as cost-sensitive learning, oversampling, and graph neural networks, provide partial solutions, they suffer from drawbacks like overfitting, label noise, and poor generalization in low-density regions. To address these challenges, we propose QCL-MixNet, a novel Quantum-Informed Contrastive Learning framework augmented with k-nearest neighbor (kNN) guided dynamic mixup for robust classification under imbalance. QCL-MixNet integrates three core innovations: (i) a Quantum Entanglement-inspired layer that models complex feature interactions through sinusoidal transformations and gated attention, (ii) a sample-aware mixup strategy that adaptively interpolates feature representations of semantically similar instances to enhance minority class representation, and (iii) a hybrid loss function that unifies focal reweighting, supervised contrastive learning, triplet margin loss, and variance regularization to improve both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on 18 real-world imbalanced datasets (binary and multi-class) demonstrate that QCL-MixNet consistently outperforms 20 state-of-the-art machine learning, deep learning, and GNN-based baselines in macro-F1 and recall, often by substantial margins. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of each architectural component. Our results establish QCL-MixNet as a new benchmark for tabular imbalance handling in expert systems. Theoretical analyses reinforce its expressiveness, generalization, and optimization robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sustainable Greenhouse Microclimate Modeling: A Comparative Analysis of Recurrent and Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17371v4)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems into greenhouses not only optimizes land use but also enhances sustainable agricultural practices by enabling dual benefits of food production and renewable energy generation. However, accurate prediction of internal environmental conditions is crucial to ensure optimal crop growth while maximizing energy production. This study introduces a novel application of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) to greenhouse microclimate modeling, comparing their performance with traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). While RNNs excel at temporal pattern recognition, they cannot explicitly model the directional relationships between environmental variables. Our STGNN approach addresses this limitation by representing these relationships as directed graphs, enabling the model to capture both environmental dependencies and their directionality. We benchmark RNNs against directed STGNNs on two 15-min-resolution datasets from Volos (Greece): a six-variable 2020 installation and a more complex eight-variable greenhouse monitored in autumn 2024. In the simpler 2020 case the RNN attains near-perfect accuracy, outperforming the STGNN. When additional drivers are available in 2024, the STGNN overtakes the RNN ($R^{2}=0.905$ vs $0.740$), demonstrating that explicitly modelling directional dependencies becomes critical as interaction complexity grows. These findings indicate when graph-based models are warranted and provide a stepping-stone toward digital twins that jointly optimise crop yield and PV power in agrivoltaic greenhouses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation Learning with Mutual Influence of Modalities for Node Classification in Multi-Modal Heterogeneous Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07895v3)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, numerous online platforms can be described as multi-modal heterogeneous networks (MMHNs), such as Douban's movie networks and Amazon's product review networks. Accurately categorizing nodes within these networks is crucial for analyzing the corresponding entities, which requires effective representation learning on nodes. However, existing multi-modal fusion methods often adopt either early fusion strategies which may lose the unique characteristics of individual modalities, or late fusion approaches overlooking the cross-modal guidance in GNN-based information propagation. In this paper, we propose a novel model for node classification in MMHNs, named Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Inter-Modal Attention (HGNN-IMA). It learns node representations by capturing the mutual influence of multiple modalities during the information propagation process, within the framework of heterogeneous graph transformer. Specifically, a nested inter-modal attention mechanism is integrated into the inter-node attention to achieve adaptive multi-modal fusion, and modality alignment is also taken into account to encourage the propagation among nodes with consistent similarities across all modalities. Moreover, an attention loss is augmented to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the model in the node classification task, providing an innovative view to handle multi-modal data, especially when accompanied with network structures.</p></details> |  |

These features are typically used as inputs to machine learning models and are represented in a tabular format. However, such approaches often overlook algorithm configurations, a key factor influencing performance. The relationships between algorithm operators, parameters, problem characteristics, and performance outcomes form a complex structure best represented as a graph. This work explores the use of heterogeneous graph data structures and graph neural networks to predict the performance of optimization algorithms by capturing the complex dependencies between problems, algorithm configurations, and performance outcomes. We focus on two modular frameworks, modCMA-ES and modDE, which decompose two widely used derivative-free optimization algorithms: the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) and differential evolution (DE). We evaluate 324 modCMA-ES and 576 modDE variants on 24 BBOB problems across six runtime budgets and two problem dimensions. Achieving up to 36.6% improvement in MSE over traditional tabular-based methods, this work highlights the potential of geometric learning in black-box optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Over-Squashing in Graph Neural Networks by Spectrum-Preserving Sparsification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16110v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The message-passing paradigm of Graph Neural Networks often struggles with exchanging information across distant nodes typically due to structural bottlenecks in certain graph regions, a limitation known as \textit{over-squashing}. To reduce such bottlenecks, \textit{graph rewiring}, which modifies graph topology, has been widely used. However, existing graph rewiring techniques often overlook the need to preserve critical properties of the original graph, e.g., \textit{spectral properties}. Moreover, many approaches rely on increasing edge count to improve connectivity, which introduces significant computational overhead and exacerbates the risk of over-smoothing. In this paper, we propose a novel graph rewiring method that leverages \textit{spectrum-preserving} graph \textit{sparsification}, for mitigating over-squashing. Our method generates graphs with enhanced connectivity while maintaining sparsity and largely preserving the original graph spectrum, effectively balancing structural bottleneck reduction and graph property preservation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its superiority over strong baseline methods in classification accuracy and retention of the Laplacian spectrum.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[KCES: Training-Free Defense for Robust Graph Neural Networks via Kernel Complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11611v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive success across a wide range of graph-based tasks, yet they remain highly vulnerable to small, imperceptible perturbations and adversarial attacks. Although numerous defense methods have been proposed to address these vulnerabilities, many rely on heuristic metrics, overfit to specific attack patterns, and suffer from high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose Kernel Complexity-Based Edge Sanitization (KCES), a training-free, model-agnostic defense framework. KCES leverages Graph Kernel Complexity (GKC), a novel metric derived from the graph's Gram matrix that characterizes GNN generalization via its test error bound. Building on GKC, we define a KC score for each edge, measuring the change in GKC when the edge is removed. Edges with high KC scores, typically introduced by adversarial perturbations, are pruned to mitigate their harmful effects, thereby enhancing GNNs' robustness. KCES can also be seamlessly integrated with existing defense strategies as a plug-and-play module without requiring training. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that KCES consistently enhances GNN robustness, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, and amplifies the effectiveness of existing defenses, offering a principled and efficient solution for securing GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Topology Actions for Power Grid Control: A Graph-Based Soft-Label Imitation Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15190v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rising proportion of renewable energy in the electricity mix introduces significant operational challenges for power grid operators. Effective power grid management demands adaptive decision-making strategies capable of handling dynamic conditions. With the increase in complexity, more and more Deep Learning (DL) approaches have been proposed to find suitable grid topologies for congestion management. In this work, we contribute to this research by introducing a novel Imitation Learning (IL) approach that leverages soft labels derived from simulated topological action outcomes, thereby capturing multiple viable actions per state. Unlike traditional IL methods that rely on hard labels to enforce a single optimal action, our method constructs soft labels that capture the effectiveness of actions that prove suitable in resolving grid congestion. To further enhance decision-making, we integrate Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to encode the structural properties of power grids, ensuring that the topology-aware representations contribute to better agent performance. Our approach significantly outperforms its hard-label counterparts as well as state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) baseline agents. Most notably, it achieves a 17% better performance compared to the greedy expert agent from which the imitation targets were derived.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML) - Applied Data Science Track</p></details> |
| **[KG-FGNN: Knowledge-guided GNN Foundation Model for Fertilisation-oriented Soil GHG Flux Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15896v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precision soil greenhouse gas (GHG) flux prediction is essential in agricultural systems for assessing environmental impacts, developing emission mitigation strategies and promoting sustainable agriculture. Due to the lack of advanced sensor and network technologies on majority of farms, there are challenges in obtaining comprehensive and diverse agricultural data. As a result, the scarcity of agricultural data seriously obstructs the application of machine learning approaches in precision soil GHG flux prediction. This research proposes a knowledge-guided graph neural network framework that addresses the above challenges by integrating knowledge embedded in an agricultural process-based model and graph neural network techniques. Specifically, we utilise the agricultural process-based model to simulate and generate multi-dimensional agricultural datasets for 47 countries that cover a wide range of agricultural variables. To extract key agricultural features and integrate correlations among agricultural features in the prediction process, we propose a machine learning framework that integrates the autoencoder and multi-target multi-graph based graph neural networks, which utilises the autoencoder to selectively extract significant agricultural features from the agricultural process-based model simulation data and the graph neural network to integrate correlations among agricultural features for accurately predict fertilisation-oriented soil GHG fluxes. Comprehensive experiments were conducted with both the agricultural simulation dataset and real-world agricultural dataset to evaluate the proposed approach in comparison with well-known baseline and state-of-the-art regression methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach provides superior accuracy and stability in fertilisation-oriented soil GHG prediction.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Effective Data Pruning through Score Extrapolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09010v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training advanced machine learning models demands massive datasets, resulting in prohibitive computational costs. To address this challenge, data pruning techniques identify and remove redundant training samples while preserving model performance. Yet, existing pruning techniques predominantly require a full initial training pass to identify removable samples, negating any efficiency benefits for single training runs. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel importance score extrapolation framework that requires training on only a small subset of data. We present two initial approaches in this framework - k-nearest neighbors and graph neural networks - to accurately predict sample importance for the entire dataset using patterns learned from this minimal subset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for 2 state-of-the-art pruning methods (Dynamic Uncertainty and TDDS), 4 different datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Places-365, and ImageNet), and 3 training paradigms (supervised, unsupervised, and adversarial). Our results indicate that score extrapolation is a promising direction to scale expensive score calculation methods, such as pruning, data attribution, or other tasks.</p></details> |  |
