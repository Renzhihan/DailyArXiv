| **[Polyspectral Mean based Time Series Clustering of Indian Stock Market](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07021v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we employ k-means clustering algorithm of polyspectral means to analyze 49 stocks in the Indian stock market. We have used spectral and bispectral information obtained from the data, by using spectral and bispectral means with different weight functions that will give us varying insights into the temporal patterns of the stocks. In particular, the higher order polyspectral means can provide significantly more information than what we can gather from power spectra, and can also unveil nonlinear trends in a time series. Through rigorous analysis, we identify five distinctive clusters, uncovering nuanced market structures. Notably, one cluster emerges as that of a conglomerate powerhouse, featuring ADANI, BIRLA, TATA, and unexpectedly, government-owned bank SBI. Another cluster spotlights the IT sector with WIPRO and TCS, while a third combines private banks, government entities, and RELIANCE. The final cluster comprises publicly traded companies with dispersed ownership. Such clustering of stocks sheds light on intricate financial relationships within the stock market, providing valuable insights for investors and analysts navigating the dynamic landscape of the Indian stock market.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Discover Data</p></details> |
| **[An Analysis of Temporal Dropout in Earth Observation Time Series for Regression Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06915v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing instances in time series data impose a significant challenge to deep learning models, particularly in regression tasks. In the Earth Observation field, satellite failure or cloud occlusion frequently results in missing time-steps, introducing uncertainties in the predicted output and causing a decline in predictive performance. While many studies address missing time-steps through data augmentation to improve model robustness, the uncertainty arising at the input level is commonly overlooked. To address this gap, we introduce Monte Carlo Temporal Dropout (MC-TD), a method that explicitly accounts for input-level uncertainty by randomly dropping time-steps during inference using a predefined dropout ratio, thereby simulating the effect of missing data. To bypass the need for costly searches for the optimal dropout ratio, we extend this approach with Monte Carlo Concrete Temporal Dropout (MC-ConcTD), a method that learns the optimal dropout distribution directly. Both MC-TD and MC-ConcTD are applied during inference, leveraging Monte Carlo sampling for uncertainty quantification. Experiments on three EO time-series datasets demonstrate that MC-ConcTD improves predictive performance and uncertainty calibration compared to existing approaches. Additionally, we highlight the advantages of adaptive dropout tuning over manual selection, making uncertainty quantification more robust and accessible for EO applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Quantized symbolic time series approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15209v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series are ubiquitous in numerous science and engineering domains, e.g., signal processing, bioinformatics, and astronomy. Previous work has verified the efficacy of symbolic time series representation in a variety of engineering applications due to its storage efficiency and numerosity reduction. The most recent symbolic aggregate approximation technique, ABBA, has been shown to preserve essential shape information of time series and improve downstream applications, e.g., neural network inference regarding prediction and anomaly detection in time series. Motivated by the emergence of high-performance hardware which enables efficient computation for low bit-width representations, we present a new quantization-based ABBA symbolic approximation technique, QABBA, which exhibits improved storage efficiency while retaining the original speed and accuracy of symbolic reconstruction. We prove an upper bound for the error arising from quantization and discuss how the number of bits should be chosen to balance this with other errors. An application of QABBA with large language models (LLMs) for time series regression is also presented, and its utility is investigated. By representing the symbolic chain of patterns on time series, QABBA not only avoids the training of embedding from scratch, but also achieves a new state-of-the-art on Monash regression dataset. The symbolic approximation to the time series offers a more efficient way to fine-tune LLMs on the time series regression task which contains various application domains. We further present a set of extensive experiments performed across various well-established datasets to demonstrate the advantages of the QABBA method for symbolic approximation.</p></details> |  |
| **[ODEStream: A Buffer-Free Online Learning Framework with ODE-based Adaptor for Streaming Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07413v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Addressing the challenges of irregularity and concept drift in streaming time series is crucial for real-world predictive modelling. Previous studies in time series continual learning often propose models that require buffering long sequences, potentially restricting the responsiveness of the inference system. Moreover, these models are typically designed for regularly sampled data, an unrealistic assumption in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces ODEStream, a novel buffer-free continual learning framework that incorporates a temporal isolation layer to capture temporal dependencies within the data. Simultaneously, it leverages the capability of neural ordinary differential equations to process irregular sequences and generate a continuous data representation, enabling seamless adaptation to changing dynamics in a data streaming scenario. Our approach focuses on learning how the dynamics and distribution of historical data change over time, facilitating direct processing of streaming sequences. Evaluations on benchmark real-world datasets demonstrate that ODEStream outperforms the state-of-the-art online learning and streaming analysis baseline models, providing accurate predictions over extended periods while minimising performance degradation over time by learning how the sequence dynamics change. The implementation of ODEStream is available at: https://github.com/FtoonAbushaqra/ODEStream.git.</p></details> |  |

| **[GenDoP: Auto-regressive Camera Trajectory Generation as a Director of Photography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07083v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera trajectory design plays a crucial role in video production, serving as a fundamental tool for conveying directorial intent and enhancing visual storytelling. In cinematography, Directors of Photography meticulously craft camera movements to achieve expressive and intentional framing. However, existing methods for camera trajectory generation remain limited: Traditional approaches rely on geometric optimization or handcrafted procedural systems, while recent learning-based methods often inherit structural biases or lack textual alignment, constraining creative synthesis. In this work, we introduce an auto-regressive model inspired by the expertise of Directors of Photography to generate artistic and expressive camera trajectories. We first introduce DataDoP, a large-scale multi-modal dataset containing 29K real-world shots with free-moving camera trajectories, depth maps, and detailed captions in specific movements, interaction with the scene, and directorial intent. Thanks to the comprehensive and diverse database, we further train an auto-regressive, decoder-only Transformer for high-quality, context-aware camera movement generation based on text guidance and RGBD inputs, named GenDoP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to existing methods, GenDoP offers better controllability, finer-grained trajectory adjustments, and higher motion stability. We believe our approach establishes a new standard for learning-based cinematography, paving the way for future advancements in camera control and filmmaking.

| **[EIDT-V: Exploiting Intersections in Diffusion Trajectories for Model-Agnostic, Zero-Shot, Training-Free Text-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06861v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot, training-free, image-based text-to-video generation is an emerging area that aims to generate videos using existing image-based diffusion models. Current methods in this space require specific architectural changes to image generation models, which limit their adaptability and scalability. In contrast to such methods, we provide a model-agnostic approach. We use intersections in diffusion trajectories, working only with the latent values. We could not obtain localized frame-wise coherence and diversity using only the intersection of trajectories. Thus, we instead use a grid-based approach. An in-context trained LLM is used to generate coherent frame-wise prompts; another is used to identify differences between frames. Based on these, we obtain a CLIP-based attention mask that controls the timing of switching the prompts for each grid cell. Earlier switching results in higher variance, while later switching results in more coherence. Therefore, our approach can ensure appropriate control between coherence and variance for the frames. Our approach results in state-of-the-art performance while being more flexible when working with diverse image-generation models. The empirical analysis using quantitative metrics and user studies confirms our model's superior temporal consistency, visual fidelity and user satisfaction, thus providing a novel way to obtain training-free, image-based text-to-video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2025</p></details> |
| **[End-to-End Driving with Online Trajectory Evaluation via BEV World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01941v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving has achieved remarkable progress by integrating perception, prediction, and planning into a fully differentiable framework. Yet, to fully realize its potential, an effective online trajectory evaluation is indispensable to ensure safety. By forecasting the future outcomes of a given trajectory, trajectory evaluation becomes much more effective. This goal can be achieved by employing a world model to capture environmental dynamics and predict future states. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end driving framework WoTE, which leverages a BEV World model to predict future BEV states for Trajectory Evaluation. The proposed BEV world model is latency-efficient compared to image-level world models and can be seamlessly supervised using off-the-shelf BEV-space traffic simulators. We validate our framework on both the NAVSIM benchmark and the closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark based on the CARLA simulator, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is released at https://github.com/liyingyanUCAS/WoTE.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAFE-AD: Cross-Scenario Adaptive Feature Enhancement for Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06584v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning based planning tasks on the nuPlan dataset have gained great interest due to their potential to generate human-like driving behaviors. However, open-loop training on the nuPlan dataset tends to cause causal confusion during closed-loop testing, and the dataset also presents a long-tail distribution of scenarios. These issues introduce challenges for imitation learning. To tackle these problems, we introduce CAFE-AD, a Cross-Scenario Adaptive Feature Enhancement for Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Driving method, designed to enhance feature representation across various scenario types. We develop an adaptive feature pruning module that ranks feature importance to capture the most relevant information while reducing the interference of noisy information during training. Moreover, we propose a cross-scenario feature interpolation module that enhances scenario information to introduce diversity, enabling the network to alleviate over-fitting in dominant scenarios. We evaluate our method CAFE-AD on the challenging public nuPlan Test14-Hard closed-loop simulation benchmark. The results demonstrate that CAFE-AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods including rule-based and hybrid planners, and exhibits the potential in mitigating the impact of long-tail distribution within the dataset. Additionally, we further validate its effectiveness in real-world environments. The code and models will be made available at https://github.com/AlniyatRui/CAFE-AD.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICRA ...</summary><p>ICRA 2025; first two authors contributed equally</p></details> |
| **[Data-driven Fuzzy Control for Time-Optimal Aggressive Trajectory Following](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06500v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimal trajectories that minimize a user-defined cost function in dynamic systems require the solution of a two-point boundary value problem. The optimization process yields an optimal control sequence that depends on the initial conditions and system parameters. However, the optimal sequence may result in undesirable behavior if the system's initial conditions and parameters are erroneous. This work presents a data-driven fuzzy controller synthesis framework that is guided by a time-optimal trajectory for multicopter tracking problems. In particular, we consider an aggressive maneuver consisting of a mid-air flip and generate a time-optimal trajectory by numerically solving the two-point boundary value problem. A fuzzy controller consisting of a stabilizing controller near hover conditions and an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) controller, trained to mimic the time-optimal aggressive trajectory, is constructed using the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 10 figures, submitted to MECC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Physical spline for denoising object trajectory data by combining splines, ML feature regression and model knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06404v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article presents a method for estimating the dynamic driving states (position, velocity, acceleration and heading) from noisy measurement data. The proposed approach is effective with both complete and partial observations, producing refined trajectory signals with kinematic consistency, ensuring that velocity is the integral of acceleration and position is the integral of velocity. Additionally, the method accounts for the constraint that vehicles can only move in the direction of their orientation. The method is implemented as a configurable python library that also enables trajectory estimation solely based on position data. Regularization is applied to prevent extreme state variations. A key application is enhancing recorded trajectory data for use as reference inputs in machine learning models. At the end, the article presents the results of the method along with a comparison to ground truth data.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, https://github.com/jonasTorz/physical_spline</p></details> |
| **[Jointly-optimized Trajectory Generation and Camera Control for 3D Coverage Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05887v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes a jointly optimized trajectory generation and camera control approach, enabling an autonomous agent, such as an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operating in 3D environments, to plan and execute coverage trajectories that maximally cover the surface area of a 3D object of interest. Specifically, the UAV's kinematic and camera control inputs are jointly optimized over a rolling planning horizon to achieve complete 3D coverage of the object. The proposed controller incorporates ray-tracing into the planning process to simulate the propagation of light rays, thereby determining the visible parts of the object through the UAV's camera. This integration enables the generation of precise look-ahead coverage trajectories. The coverage planning problem is formulated as a rolling finite-horizon optimal control problem and solved using mixed-integer programming techniques. Extensive real-world and synthetic experiments validate the performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differential Flatness-based Fast Trajectory Planning for Fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01468v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the strong nonlinearity and nonholonomic dynamics, despite the various general trajectory optimization methods presented, few of them can guarantee efficient computation and physical feasibility for relatively complicated fixed-wing UAV dynamics. Aiming at this issue, this paper investigates a differential flatness-based trajectory optimization method for fixed-wing UAVs (DFTO-FW). The customized trajectory representation is presented through differential flat characteristics analysis and polynomial parameterization, eliminating equality constraints to avoid the heavy computational burdens of solving complex dynamics. Through the design of integral performance costs and derivation of analytical gradients, the original trajectory optimization is transcribed into a lightweight, unconstrained, gradient-analytical optimization with linear time complexity to improve efficiency further. The simulation experiments illustrate the superior efficiency of the DFTO-FW, which takes sub-second CPU time (on a personal desktop) against other competitors by orders of magnitude to generate fixed-wing UAV trajectories in randomly generated obstacle environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version with minor language and formatting edits.

| **[Conformal Slit Mapping Based Spiral Tool Trajectory Planning for Ball-end Milling on Complex Freeform Surfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06310v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a spiral-based complete coverage strategy for ball-end milling on freeform surfaces, utilizing conformal slit mapping to generate milling trajectories that are more compact, smoother, and evenly distributed when machining 2D cavities with islands. This approach, an upgrade from traditional methods, extends the original algorithm to effectively address 3D perforated surface milling. Unlike conventional algorithms, the method embeds a continuous spiral trajectory within perforated surfaces without requiring cellular decomposition or additional boundaries. The proposed method addresses three primary challenges, including modifying conformal slit mapping for mesh surfaces, maintaining uniform scallop height between adjacent spiral trajectories, and optimizing the mapped origin point to ensure uniform scallop height distribution. To overcome these challenges, surface flattening techniques are incorporated into the original approach to accommodate mesh surfaces effectively. Tool path spacing is then optimized using a binary search strategy to regulate scallop height. A functional energy metric associated with scallop height uniformity is introduced for rapid evaluation of points mapped to the origin, with the minimum functional energy determined through perturbation techniques. The optimal placement of this point is identified using a modified gradient descent approach applied to the energy function. Validation on intricate surfaces, including low-quality and high-genus meshes, verifies the robustness of the algorithm. Surface milling experiments comparing this method with conventional techniques indicate a 15.63% improvement in scallop height uniformity while reducing machining time, average spindle impact, and spindle impact variance by up to 7.36%, 27.79%, and 55.98%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Novel Data-Driven Indices for Early Detection and Quantification of Short-Term Voltage Instability from Voltage Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05556v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel Short-Term Voltage Stability Index (STVSI), which leverages Lyapunov Exponent-based detection to assess and quantify short-term stability triggered by Over Excitation Limiters (OELs) or undamped oscillations in voltage. The proposed method is measurement-based and decomposes the voltage trajectory into two key components using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD): a residual part, which indicates delayed voltage recovery, and an oscillatory part, which captures oscillations. The residual component is critical, as it can detect activation of OELs in synchronous generators or Low Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) relays in inverter-based resources, potentially leading to instability within the quasisteady-state time frame. Meanwhile, the oscillatory component may indicate either a stable or unstable state in the short term. To accurately assess stability, STVSI employs an entropy-based metric to measure the proximity of the system to instability, with specific indices for short-term voltage stability based on oscillations and recovery. Simulations on the Nordic power system demonstrate that STVSI effectively identifies and categorizes voltage stability issues. Moreover, STVSI not only detects voltage stability conditions but also qualitatively assesses the extent of stability, providing a nuanced measure of stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted for publication in IEEE PESGM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Vision-Language Model Predictive Control for Manipulation Planning and Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05225v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a widely adopted control paradigm that leverages predictive models to estimate future system states and optimize control inputs accordingly. However, while MPC excels in planning and control, it lacks the capability for environmental perception, leading to failures in complex and unstructured scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce Vision-Language Model Predictive Control (VLMPC), a robotic manipulation planning framework that integrates the perception power of vision-language models (VLMs) with MPC. VLMPC utilizes a conditional action sampling module that takes a goal image or language instruction as input and leverages VLM to generate candidate action sequences. These candidates are fed into a video prediction model that simulates future frames based on the actions. In addition, we propose an enhanced variant, Traj-VLMPC, which replaces video prediction with motion trajectory generation to reduce computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. Traj-VLMPC estimates motion dynamics conditioned on the candidate actions, offering a more efficient alternative for long-horizon tasks and real-time applications. Both VLMPC and Traj-VLMPC select the optimal action sequence using a VLM-based hierarchical cost function that captures both pixel-level and knowledge-level consistency between the current observation and the task input. We demonstrate that both approaches outperform existing state-of-the-art methods on public benchmarks and achieve excellent performance in various real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Despite recent advancements in place recognition using 2D cameras or 3D LiDAR, it remains to be seen how to use 4D radar for place recognition - an increasingly popular sensor for its robustness against adverse weather and lighting conditions. Compared to LiDAR point clouds, radar data are drastically sparser, noisier and in much lower resolution, which hampers their ability to effectively represent scenes, posing significant challenges for 4D radar-based place recognition. This work addresses these challenges by leveraging multi-modal information from sequential 4D radar scans and effectively extracting and aggregating spatio-temporal features.Our approach follows a principled pipeline that comprises (1) dynamic points removal and ego-velocity estimation from velocity property, (2) bird's eye view (BEV) feature encoding on the refined point cloud, (3) feature alignment using BEV feature map motion trajectory calculated by ego-velocity, (4) multi-scale spatio-temporal features of the aligned BEV feature maps are extracted and aggregated.Real-world experimental results validate the feasibility of the proposed method and demonstrate its robustness in handling dynamic environments.

| **[MIAT: Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer for Spatio-Temporal Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05059v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction is critical for safe and efficient autonomous driving, especially in mixed traffic environments with both human-driven and autonomous vehicles. However, uncertainties introduced by inherent driving behaviors -- such as acceleration, deceleration, and left and right maneuvers -- pose significant challenges for reliable trajectory prediction. We introduce a Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer (MIAT) architecture, which integrates a maneuver intention awareness mechanism with spatiotemporal interaction modeling to enhance long-horizon trajectory predictions. We systematically investigate the impact of varying awareness of maneuver intention on both short- and long-horizon trajectory predictions. Evaluated on the real-world NGSIM dataset and benchmarked against various transformer- and LSTM-based methods, our approach achieves an improvement of up to 4.7% in short-horizon predictions and a 1.6% in long-horizon predictions compared to other intention-aware benchmark methods. Moreover, by leveraging an intention awareness control mechanism, MIAT realizes an 11.1% performance boost in long-horizon predictions, with a modest drop in short-horizon performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Segmented Trajectory Optimization for Autonomous Parking in Unstructured Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05041v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a Segmented Trajectory Optimization (STO) method for autonomous parking, which refines an initial trajectory into a dynamically feasible and collision-free one using an iterative SQP-based approach. STO maintains the maneuver strategy of the high-level global planner while allowing curvature discontinuities at switching points to improve maneuver efficiency. To ensure safety, a convex corridor is constructed via GJK-accelerated ellipse shrinking and expansion, serving as safety constraints in each iteration. Numerical simulations in perpendicular and reverse-angled parking scenarios demonstrate that STO enhances maneuver efficiency while ensuring safety. Moreover, computational performance confirms its practicality for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IROS 2025</p></details> |
| **[DyTTP: Trajectory Prediction with Normalization-Free Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05356v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is a cornerstone for the safe operation of autonomous driving systems, where understanding the dynamic behavior of surrounding agents is crucial. Transformer-based architectures have demonstrated significant promise in capturing complex spatio-temporality dependencies. However, their reliance on normalization layers can lead to computation overhead and training instabilities. In this work, we present a two-fold approach to address these challenges. First, we integrate DynamicTanh (DyT), which is the latest method to promote transformers, into the backbone, replacing traditional layer normalization. This modification simplifies the network architecture and improves the stability of the inference. We are the first work to deploy the DyT to the trajectory prediction task. Complementing this, we employ a snapshot ensemble strategy to further boost trajectory prediction performance. Using cyclical learning rate scheduling, multiple model snapshots are captured during a single training run. These snapshots are then aggregated via simple averaging at inference time, allowing the model to benefit from diverse hypotheses without incurring substantial additional computational cost. Extensive experiments on Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our combined approach significantly improves prediction accuracy, inference speed and robustness in diverse driving scenarios. This work underscores the potential of normalization-free transformer designs augmented with lightweight ensemble techniques in advancing trajectory forecasting for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |
| **[GAMDTP: Dynamic Trajectory Prediction with Graph Attention Mamba Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04862v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate motion prediction of traffic agents is crucial for the safety and stability of autonomous driving systems. In this paper, we introduce GAMDTP, a novel graph attention-based network tailored for dynamic trajectory prediction. Specifically, we fuse the result of self attention and mamba-ssm through a gate mechanism, leveraging the strengths of both to extract features more efficiently and accurately, in each graph convolution layer. GAMDTP encodes the high-definition map(HD map) data and the agents' historical trajectory coordinates and decodes the network's output to generate the final prediction results. Additionally, recent approaches predominantly focus on dynamically fusing historical forecast results and rely on two-stage frameworks including proposal and refinement. To further enhance the performance of the two-stage frameworks we also design a scoring mechanism to evaluate the prediction quality during the proposal and refinement processes. Experiments on the Argoverse dataset demonstrates that GAMDTP achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving superior accuracy in dynamic trajectory prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization of Stochastic Systems under Chance Constraints via Set Erosion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04705v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the trajectory optimization problem under chance constraints for continuous-time stochastic systems. To address chance constraints imposed on the entire stochastic trajectory, we propose a framework based on the set erosion strategy, which converts the chance constraints into safety constraints on an eroded subset of the safe set along the corresponding deterministic trajectory. The depth of erosion is captured by the probabilistic bound on the distance between the stochastic trajectory and its deterministic counterpart, for which we utilize a novel and sharp probabilistic bound developed recently. By adopting this framework, a deterministic control input sequence can be obtained, whose feasibility and performance are demonstrated through theoretical analysis. Our framework is compatible with various deterministic optimal control techniques, offering great flexibility and computational efficiency in a wide range of scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, our method provides the first scalable trajectory optimization scheme for high-dimensional stochastic systems under trajectory level chance constraints. We validate the proposed method through two numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Planning Safety Trajectories with Dual-Phase, Physics-Informed, and Transportation Knowledge-Driven Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04562v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have demonstrated strong reasoning and generalization capabilities in driving-related tasks, including scene understanding, planning, and control. However, they still face challenges in hallucinations, uncertainty, and long inference latency. While existing foundation models have general knowledge of avoiding collisions, they often lack transportation-specific safety knowledge. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LetsPi, a physics-informed, dual-phase, knowledge-driven framework for safe, human-like trajectory planning. To prevent hallucinations and minimize uncertainty, this hybrid framework integrates Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning with physics-informed social force dynamics. LetsPi leverages the LLM to analyze driving scenes and historical information, providing appropriate parameters and target destinations (goals) for the social force model, which then generates the future trajectory. Moreover, the dual-phase architecture balances reasoning and computational efficiency through its Memory Collection phase and Fast Inference phase. The Memory Collection phase leverages the physics-informed LLM to process and refine planning results through reasoning, reflection, and memory modules, storing safe, high-quality driving experiences in a memory bank. Surrogate safety measures and physics-informed prompt techniques are introduced to enhance the LLM's knowledge of transportation safety and physical force, respectively. The Fast Inference phase extracts similar driving experiences as few-shot examples for new scenarios, while simplifying input-output requirements to enable rapid trajectory planning without compromising safety. Extensive experiments using the HighD dataset demonstrate that LetsPi outperforms baseline models across five safety metrics.See PDF for project Github link.</p></details> |  |
| **[A High-Speed Time-Optimal Trajectory Generation Strategy via a Two-layer Planning Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11072v2)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion planning and trajectory generation are crucial technologies in various domains including the control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, manipulators, and rockets. However, optimization-based real-time motion planning becomes increasingly challenging due to the problem's probable non-convexity and the inherent limitations of non-linear programming algorithms. Highly nonlinear dynamics, obstacle avoidance constraints, and non-convex inputs can exacerbate these difficulties. In order to enhance the robustness and reduce the computational burden, this paper proposes a two-layer trajectory generating algorithm for intelligent ground vehicles with convex optimization methods, aiming to provide real-time guarantees for trajectory optimization and to improve the calculate speed of motion prediction. Our approach involves breaking down the original problem into small horizon-based planning cycles with fixed final times, referred to as planning cycles. Each planning cycle is then solved within a series of restricted convex sets constructed by some customized search algorithms incrementally. We rigorously establish these advantages through mathematical analysis under moderate assumptions and comprehensive experimental validations. For linear vehicle models, comparative experiments with general sequential convex programming algorithms demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method, particularly in terms of the computational efficiency in dynamic maps and the reduced final time.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Self-Supervised Learning Approach with Differentiable Optimization for UAV Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04289v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant traction across various fields, path planning in 3D environments remains a critical challenge, particularly under size, weight, and power (SWAP) constraints. Traditional modular planning systems often introduce latency and suboptimal performance due to limited information sharing and local minima issues. End-to-end learning approaches streamline the pipeline by mapping sensory observations directly to actions but require large-scale datasets, face significant sim-to-real gaps, or lack dynamical feasibility. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised UAV trajectory planning pipeline that integrates a learning-based depth perception with differentiable trajectory optimization. A 3D cost map guides UAV behavior without expert demonstrations or human labels. Additionally, we incorporate a neural network-based time allocation strategy to improve the efficiency and optimality. The system thus combines robust learning-based perception with reliable physics-based optimization for improved generalizability and interpretability.

| **[Nonlinear second-order dynamics describe labial constriction trajectories across languages and contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08351v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the dynamics of labial constriction trajectories during the production of /b/ and /m/ in English and Mandarin. We find that, across languages and contexts, the ratio of instantaneous displacement to instantaneous velocity generally follows an exponential decay curve from movement onset to movement offset. We formalize this empirical discovery in a differential equation and, in combination with an assumption of point attractor dynamics, derive a nonlinear second-order dynamical system describing labial constriction trajectories. The equation has only two parameters, T and r. T corresponds to the target state and r corresponds to movement rapidity. Thus, each of the parameters corresponds to a phonetically relevant dimension of control. Nonlinear regression demonstrates that the model provides excellent fits to individual movement trajectories. Moreover, trajectories simulated from the model qualitatively match empirical trajectories, and capture key kinematic variables like duration, peak velocity, and time to achieve peak velocity. The model constitutes a proposal for the dynamics of individual articulatory movements, and thus offers a novel foundation from which to understand additional influences on articulatory kinematics like prosody, inter-movement coordination, and stochastic noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Trajectory Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Learn Incrementally Before An Ongoing Trajectory Terminates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15612v6)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to learn a reward function and a corresponding policy that best fit the demonstrated trajectories of an expert. However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Sound Source Trajectories for Universal Sound Separation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04843v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods utilizing spatial information for sound source separation require prior knowledge of the direction of arrival (DOA) of the source or utilize estimated but imprecise localization results, which impairs the separation performance, especially when the sound sources are moving. In fact, sound source localization and separation are interconnected problems, that is, sound source localization facilitates sound separation while sound separation contributes to refined source localization. This paper proposes a method utilizing the mutual facilitation mechanism between sound source localization and separation for moving sources. The proposed method comprises three stages. The first stage is initial tracking, which tracks each sound source from the audio mixture based on the source signal envelope estimation. These tracking results may lack sufficient accuracy. The second stage involves mutual facilitation: Sound separation is conducted using preliminary sound source tracking results. Subsequently, sound source tracking is performed on the separated signals, thereby refining the tracking precision. The refined trajectories further improve separation performance. This mutual facilitation process can be iterated multiple times. In the third stage, a neural beamformer estimates precise single-channel separation results based on the refined tracking trajectories and multi-channel separation outputs. Simulation experiments conducted under reverberant conditions and with moving sound sources demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve more accurate separation based on refined tracking results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing(TASLP)</p></details> |

When humans grasp an object, appropriate trajectories naturally form in our minds to use it for specific tasks. Hand-object interaction trajectory priors can greatly benefit applications in robotics, embodied AI, augmented reality and related fields. However, synthesizing realistic and appropriate hand trajectories given a single object or hand-object interaction image is a highly ambiguous task, requiring to correctly identify the object of interest and possibly even the correct interaction among many possible alternatives. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose the SIGHT-Fusion system, consisting of a curated pipeline for extracting visual features of hand-object interaction details from egocentric videos involving object manipulation, and a diffusion-based conditional motion generation model processing the extracted features. We train our method given video data with corresponding hand trajectory annotations, without supervision in the form of action labels. For the evaluation, we establish benchmarks utilizing the first-person FPHAB and HOI4D datasets, testing our method against various baselines and using multiple metrics. We also introduce task simulators for executing the generated hand trajectories and reporting task success rates as an additional metric. Experiments show that our method generates more appropriate and realistic hand trajectories than baselines and presents promising generalization capability on unseen objects. The accuracy of the generated hand trajectories is confirmed in a physics simulation setting, showcasing the authenticity of the created sequences and their applicability in downstream uses.</p></details> |  |

Deep learning approaches have become key in this area, utilizing large-scale trajectory datasets to model movement patterns, but face challenges in managing complex spatial dependencies and adapting to dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce TrajLearn, a novel model for trajectory prediction that leverages generative modeling of higher-order mobility flows based on hexagonal spatial representation. TrajLearn predicts the next $k$ steps by integrating a customized beam search for exploring multiple potential paths while maintaining spatial continuity. We conducted a rigorous evaluation of TrajLearn, benchmarking it against leading state-of-the-art approaches and meaningful baselines. The results indicate that TrajLearn achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of up to ~40% across multiple real-world trajectory datasets. In addition, we evaluated different prediction horizons (i.e., various values of $k$), conducted resolution sensitivity analysis, and performed ablation studies to assess the impact of key model components. Furthermore, we developed a novel algorithm to generate mixed-resolution maps by hierarchically subdividing hexagonal regions into finer segments within a specified observation area. This approach supports selective detailing, applying finer resolution to areas of interest or high activity (e.g., urban centers) while using coarser resolution for less significant regions (e.g., rural areas), effectively reducing data storage requirements and computational overhead. We promote reproducibility and adaptability by offering complete code, data, and detailed documentation with flexible configuration options for various applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems</p></details> |
| **[Target Prediction Under Deceptive Switching Strategies via Outlier-Robust Filtering of Partially Observed Incomplete Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03502v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by a study on deception and counter-deception, this paper addresses the problem of identifying an agent's target as it seeks to reach one of two targets in a given environment. In practice, an agent may initially follow a strategy to aim at one target but decide to switch to another midway. Such a strategy can be deceptive when the counterpart only has access to imperfect observations, which include heavily corrupted sensor noise and possible outliers, making it difficult to visually identify the agent's true intent. To counter deception and identify the true target, we utilize prior knowledge of the agent's dynamics and the imprecisely observed partial trajectory of the agent's states to dynamically update the estimation of the posterior probability of whether a deceptive switch has taken place. However, existing methods in the literature have not achieved effective deception identification within a reasonable computation time. We propose a set of outlier-robust change detection methods to track relevant change-related statistics efficiently, enabling the detection of deceptive strategies in hidden nonlinear dynamics with reasonable computational effort. The performance of the proposed framework is examined for Weapon-Target Assignment (WTA) detection under deceptive strategies using random simulations in the kinematics model with external forcing.</p></details> |  |

In this method, each control input between two consecutive events is a polynomial and its coefficients are chosen to minimize the error in approximating a continuous-time control signal. We design an event-triggering rule that guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of the tracking error and non-Zeno behavior of inter-event times. We illustrate our results through a suite of numerical simulations and experiments, which indicate that the number of events generated by the proposed controller is significantly less compared to that by a time-triggered controller or a event-triggered controller based on zero-order hold while guaranteeing similar tracking performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Hamiltonian for Direct Construction of Safe Set from Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03233v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In continuous-time optimal control, evaluating the Hamiltonian requires solving a constrained optimization problem using the system's dynamics model. Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis for safety verification has demonstrated practical utility only when efficient evaluation of the Hamiltonian over a large state-time grid is possible. In this study, we introduce the concept of a data-driven Hamiltonian (DDH), which circumvents the need for an explicit dynamics model by relying only on mild prior knowledge (e.g., Lipschitz constants), thus enabling the construction of reachable sets directly from trajectory data. Recognizing that the Hamiltonian is the optimal inner product between a given costate and realizable state velocities, the DDH estimates the Hamiltonian using the worst-case realization of the velocity field based on the observed state trajectory data. This formulation ensures a conservative approximation of the true Hamiltonian for uncertain dynamics. The reachable set computed based on the DDH is also ensured to be a conservative approximation of the true reachable set. Next, we propose a data-efficient safe experiment framework for gradual expansion of safe sets using the DDH. This is achieved by iteratively conducting experiments within the computed data-driven safe set and updating the set using newly collected trajectory data. To demonstrate the capabilities of our approach, we showcase its effectiveness in safe flight envelope expansion for a tiltrotor vehicle transitioning from near-hover to forward flight.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the extended version of the article submitted to IEEE CDC 2025.

| **[Learning Lie Group Generators from Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03220v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates the inverse problem of generator recovery in matrix Lie groups from discretized trajectories. Let $G$ be a real matrix Lie group and $\mathfrak{g} = \text{Lie}(G)$ its corresponding Lie algebra. A smooth trajectory $\gamma($t$)$ generated by a fixed Lie algebra element $\xi \in \mathfrak{g}$ follows the exponential flow $\gamma($t$) = g_0 \cdot \exp(t \xi)$. The central task addressed in this work is the reconstruction of such a latent generator $\xi$ from a discretized sequence of poses $ \{g_0, g_1, \dots, g_T\} \subset G$, sampled at uniform time intervals. This problem is formulated as a data-driven regression from normalized sequences of discrete Lie algebra increments $\log\left(g_{t}^{-1} g_{t+1}\right)$ to the constant generator $\xi \in \mathfrak{g}$. A feedforward neural network is trained to learn this mapping across several groups, including $\text{SE(2)}, \text{SE(3)}, \text{SO(3)}, and \text{SL(2,$\mathbb{R})$}$. It demonstrates strong empirical accuracy under both clean and noisy conditions, which validates the viability of data-driven recovery of Lie group generators using shallow neural architectures.

Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 20.81% in satisfying traversability constraints and 28.51% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quattro: Transformer-Accelerated Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator Framework for Fast Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01806v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time optimal control remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, especially for nonlinear systems with stringent performance requirements. As one of the representative trajectory optimization algorithms, the iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) faces limitations due to their inherently sequential computational nature, which restricts the efficiency and applicability of real-time control for robotic systems. While existing parallel implementations aim to overcome the above limitations, they typically demand additional computational iterations and high-performance hardware, leading to only modest practical improvements. In this paper, we introduce Quattro, a transformer-accelerated iLQR framework employing an algorithm-hardware co-design strategy to predict intermediate feedback and feedforward matrices. It facilitates effective parallel computations on resource-constrained devices without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on cart-pole and quadrotor systems show an algorithm-level acceleration of up to 5.3$\times$ and 27$\times$ per iteration, respectively. When integrated into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, Quattro achieves overall speedups of 2.8$\times$ for the cart-pole and 17.8$\times$ for the quadrotor compared to the one that applies traditional iLQR. Transformer inference is deployed on FPGA to maximize performance, achieving further up to 20.8$\times$ speedup over prevalent embedded CPUs with over 11$\times$ power reduction than GPU and low hardware resource overhead.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often struggle to accurately capture this intricate structure from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data, particularly due to the lack of ground truth labels and the ambiguous, intertwined nature of fiber trajectories. We present a novel deep learning framework for unsupervised clustering of myocardial fibers, providing a data-driven approach to identifying distinct fiber bundles. We uniquely combine a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network to capture local sequential information along fibers, with a Transformer autoencoder to learn global shape features, with pointwise incorporation of essential anatomical context. Clustering these representations using a density-based algorithm identifies 33 to 62 robust clusters, successfully capturing the subtle distinctions in fiber trajectories with varying levels of granularity. Our framework offers a new, flexible, and quantitative way to analyze myocardial structure, achieving a level of delineation that, to our knowledge, has not been previously achieved, with potential applications in improving surgical planning, characterizing disease-related remodeling, and ultimately, advancing personalized cardiac care.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Virtual Target Trajectory Prediction for Stochastic Targets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01851v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction of other vehicles is crucial for autonomous vehicles, with applications from missile guidance to UAV collision avoidance. Typically, target trajectories are assumed deterministic, but real-world aerial vehicles exhibit stochastic behavior, such as evasive maneuvers or gliders circling in thermals. This paper uses Conditional Normalizing Flows, an unsupervised Machine Learning technique, to learn and predict the stochastic behavior of targets of guided missiles using trajectory data. The trained model predicts the distribution of future target positions based on initial conditions and parameters of the dynamics. Samples from this distribution are clustered using a time series k-means algorithm to generate representative trajectories, termed virtual targets. The method is fast and target-agnostic, requiring only training data in the form of target trajectories. Thus, it serves as a drop-in replacement for deterministic trajectory predictions in guidance laws and path planning. Simulated scenarios demonstrate the approach's effectiveness for aerial vehicles with random maneuvers, bridging the gap between deterministic predictions and stochastic reality, advancing guidance and control algorithms for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>will ...</summary><p>will be submitted to Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics</p></details> |
| **[Semi-Self Representation Learning for Crowdsourced WiFi Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03756v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WiFi fingerprint-based localization has been studied intensively. Point-based solutions rely on position annotations of WiFi fingerprints. Trajectory-based solutions, however, require end-position annotations of WiFi trajectories, where a WiFi trajectory is a multivariate time series of signal features. A trajectory dataset is much larger than a pointwise dataset as the number of potential trajectories in a field may grow exponentially with respect to the size of the field. This work presents a semi-self representation learning solution, where a large dataset $C$ of crowdsourced unlabeled WiFi trajectories can be automatically labeled by a much smaller dataset $\tilde C$ of labeled WiFi trajectories. The size of $\tilde C$ only needs to be proportional to the size of the physical field, while the unlabeled $C$ could be much larger. This is made possible through a novel ``cut-and-flip'' augmentation scheme based on the meet-in-the-middle paradigm. A two-stage learning consisting of trajectory embedding followed by endpoint embedding is proposed for the unlabeled $C$. Then the learned representations are labeled by $\tilde C$ and connected to a neural-based localization network. The result, while delivering promising accuracy, significantly relieves the burden of human annotations for trajectory-based localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VTC2025-Spring</p></details> |
| **[ACTIVE: Continuous Similarity Search for Vessel Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01142v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Publicly available vessel trajectory data is emitted continuously from the global AIS system. Continuous trajectory similarity search on this data has applications in, e.g., maritime navigation and safety. Existing proposals typically assume an offline setting and focus on finding similarities between complete trajectories. Such proposals are less effective when applied to online scenarios, where similarity comparisons must be performed continuously as new trajectory data arrives and trajectories evolve. We therefore propose a real-time continuous trajectory similarity search method for vessels (ACTIVE). We introduce a novel similarity measure, object-trajectory real-time distance, that emphasizes the anticipated future movement trends of vessels, enabling more predictive and forward-looking comparisons. Next, we propose a segment-based vessel trajectory index structure that organizes historical trajectories into smaller and manageable segments, facilitating accelerated similarity computations. Leveraging this index, we propose an efficient continuous similar trajectory search (CSTS) algorithm together with a variety of search space pruning strategies that reduce unnecessary computations during the continuous similarity search, thereby further improving efficiency. Extensive experiments on two large real-world AIS datasets offer evidence that ACTIVE is capable of outperforming state-of-the-art methods considerably. ACTIVE significantly reduces index construction costs and index size while achieving a 70% reduction in terms of query time and a 60% increase in terms of hit rate.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we aim to learn the trajectory prediction model by using broad out-of-domain data to improve its performance and generalization ability. Trajectory model is designed to predict any-point trajectories in the current frame given an instruction and can provide detailed control guidance for robotic policy learning. To handle the diverse out-of-domain data distribution, we propose a sparsely-gated MoE (\textbf{Top-1} gating strategy) architecture for trajectory model, coined as \textbf{Tra-MoE}. The sparse activation design enables good balance between parameter cooperation and specialization, effectively benefiting from large-scale out-of-domain data while maintaining constant FLOPs per token. In addition, we further introduce an adaptive policy conditioning technique by learning 2D mask representations for predicted trajectories, which is explicitly aligned with image observations to guide action prediction more flexibly. We perform extensive experiments on both simulation and real-world scenarios to verify the effectiveness of Tra-MoE and adaptive policy conditioning technique. We also conduct a comprehensive empirical study to train Tra-MoE, demonstrating that our Tra-MoE consistently exhibits superior performance compared to the dense baseline model, even when the latter is scaled to match Tra-MoE's parameter count.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025.

| **[Timely Trajectory Reconstruction in Finite Buffer Remote Tracking Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00849v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote tracking systems play a critical role in applications such as IoT, monitoring, surveillance and healthcare. In such systems, maintaining both real-time state awareness (for online decision making) and accurate reconstruction of historical trajectories (for offline post-processing) are essential. While the Age of Information (AoI) metric has been extensively studied as a measure of freshness, it does not capture the accuracy with which past trajectories can be reconstructed. In this work, we investigate reconstruction error as a complementary metric to AoI, addressing the trade-off between timely updates and historical accuracy. Specifically, we consider three policies, each prioritizing different aspects of information management: Keep-Old, Keep-Fresh, and our proposed Inter-arrival-Aware dropping policy. We compare these policies in terms of impact on both AoI and reconstruction error in a remote tracking system with a finite buffer. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of queueing behavior, we demonstrate that while the Keep-Fresh policy minimizes AoI, it does not necessarily minimize reconstruction error. In contrast, our proposed Inter-arrival-Aware dropping policy dynamically adjusts packet retention decisions based on generation times, achieving a balance between AoI and reconstruction error. Our results provide key insights into the design of efficient update policies for resource-constrained IoT networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Grained Behavior and Lane Constraints Guided Trajectory Prediction Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21477v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction, as a critical component of autonomous driving systems, has attracted the attention of many researchers. Existing prediction algorithms focus on extracting more detailed scene features or selecting more reasonable trajectory destinations. However, in the face of dynamic and evolving future movements of the target vehicle, these algorithms cannot provide a fine-grained and continuous description of future behaviors and lane constraints, which degrades the prediction accuracy. To address this challenge, we present BLNet, a novel dualstream architecture that synergistically integrates behavioral intention recognition and lane constraint modeling through parallel attention mechanisms. The framework generates fine-grained behavior state queries (capturing spatial-temporal movement patterns) and lane queries (encoding lane topology constraints), supervised by two auxiliary losses, respectively. Subsequently, a two-stage decoder first produces trajectory proposals, then performs point-level refinement by jointly incorporating both the continuity of passed lanes and future motion features. Extensive experiments on two large datasets, nuScenes and Argoverse, show that our network exhibits significant performance gains over existing direct regression and goal-based algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

The proposed system employs multiple UAVs equipped with dual-functional radar-communication capabilities to simultaneously perform target sensing and provide communication services to users. We formulate a joint optimization problem that aims to maximize the sum rate of users while maintaining target sensing performance through coordinated beamforming and UAV trajectory design. To address this challenging non-convex problem, we develop a block coordinated descent (BCD)-based iterative algorithm that decomposes the original problem into tractable subproblems. Then, the beamforming design problem is addressed using fractional programming, while the UAV trajectory is refined through the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint optimization approach achieves significant performance improvements in both communication throughput and sensing accuracy compared to conventional, separated designs. We also show that proper coordination of multiple UAVs through optimized trajectories and beamforming patterns can effectively balance the tradeoff between sensing and communication objectives.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |

To this end, an accurate prediction of dynamic obstacle trajectories is vital. Traditional approaches to trajectory prediction face limitations in generalizability and often fail to account for the intentions of other vessels. While recent research has considered incorporating the intentions of dynamic obstacles, these efforts are typically based on the own-ship's interpretation of the situation. The current state-of-the-art in this area is a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model, which infers target vessel intentions by considering multiple underlying causes and allowing for different interpretations of the situation by different vessels. However, since its inception, there have not been any significant structural improvements to this model. In this paper, we propose enhancing the DBN model by incorporating considerations for grounding hazards and vessel waypoint information. The proposed model is validated using real vessel encounters extracted from historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data.</p></details> |  |

Although mmWaves can offer a notably high data rate, their high penetration and propagation losses mean that line of sight (LoS) is necessary for effective communication. Due to the presence of obstacles and user mobility, UAV trajectory planning plays a crucial role in improving system performance. In this work, we propose a novel computational geometry-based trajectory planning scheme by considering the user mobility, the priority of the delay sensitive ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) and the high throughput requirements of the enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) traffic. Specifically, we use geometric tools like Apollonius circle and minimum enclosing ball of balls to find the optimal position of the UAV that supports uninterrupted connections to the URLLC users and maximizes the aggregate throughput of the eMBB users. Finally, the numerical results demonstrate the benefits of the suggested approach over an existing state of the art benchmark scheme in terms of sum throughput obtained by URLLC and eMBB users.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to a reputed conference</p></details> |

| **[Aligning Diffusion Model with Problem Constraints for Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00342v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently emerged as effective generative frameworks for trajectory optimization, capable of producing high-quality and diverse solutions. However, training these models in a purely data-driven manner without explicit incorporation of constraint information often leads to violations of critical constraints, such as goal-reaching, collision avoidance, and adherence to system dynamics. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that aligns diffusion models explicitly with problem-specific constraints, drawing insights from the Dynamic Data-driven Application Systems (DDDAS) framework. Our approach introduces a hybrid loss function that explicitly measures and penalizes constraint violations during training. Furthermore, by statistically analyzing how constraint violations evolve throughout the diffusion steps, we develop a re-weighting strategy that aligns predicted violations to ground truth statistics at each diffusion step. Evaluated on a tabletop manipulation and a two-car reach-avoid problem, our constraint-aligned diffusion model significantly reduces constraint violations compared to traditional diffusion models, while maintaining the quality of trajectory solutions. This approach is well-suited for integration into the DDDAS framework for efficient online trajectory adaptation as new environmental data becomes available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Velocity and Acceleration: Self-Supervised Motion Consistency for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24272v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human motion is crucial for accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction. Conventional methods typically rely on supervised learning, where ground-truth labels are directly optimized against predicted trajectories. This amplifies the limitations caused by long-tailed data distributions, making it difficult for the model to capture abnormal behaviors. In this work, we propose a self-supervised pedestrian trajectory prediction framework that explicitly models position, velocity, and acceleration. We leverage velocity and acceleration information to enhance position prediction through feature injection and a self-supervised motion consistency mechanism. Our model hierarchically injects velocity features into the position stream. Acceleration features are injected into the velocity stream. This enables the model to predict position, velocity, and acceleration jointly. From the predicted position, we compute corresponding pseudo velocity and acceleration, allowing the model to learn from data-generated pseudo labels and thus achieve self-supervised learning. We further design a motion consistency evaluation strategy grounded in physical principles; it selects the most reasonable predicted motion trend by comparing it with historical dynamics and uses this trend to guide and constrain trajectory generation. We conduct experiments on the ETH-UCY and Stanford Drone datasets, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions with Diffuser for Safety-Critical Trajectory Planning at Signal-Free Intersections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00162v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning safe and efficient trajectories through signal-free intersections presents significant challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in dynamic, multi-task environments with unpredictable interactions and an increased possibility of conflicts. This study aims to address these challenges by developing a unified, robust, adaptive framework to ensure safety and efficiency across three distinct intersection movements: left-turn, right-turn, and straight-ahead. Existing methods often struggle to reliably ensure safety and effectively learn multi-task behaviors from demonstrations in such environments. This study proposes a safety-critical planning method that integrates Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions (DHOCBF) with a diffusion-based model, called Dynamic Safety-Critical Diffuser (DSC-Diffuser). The DSC-Diffuser leverages task-guided planning to enhance efficiency, allowing the simultaneous learning of multiple driving tasks from real-world expert demonstrations. Moreover, the incorporation of goal-oriented constraints significantly reduces displacement errors, ensuring precise trajectory execution. To further ensure driving safety in dynamic environments, the proposed DHOCBF framework dynamically adjusts to account for the movements of surrounding vehicles, offering enhanced adaptability and reduce the conservatism compared to traditional control barrier functions. Validity evaluations of DHOCBF, conducted through numerical simulations, demonstrate its robustness in adapting to variations in obstacle velocities, sizes, uncertainties, and locations, effectively maintaining driving safety across a wide range of complex and uncertain scenarios. Comprehensive performance evaluations demonstrate that DSC-Diffuser generates realistic, stable, and generalizable policies, providing flexibility and reliable safety assurance in complex multi-task driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 fi...</summary><p>11 figures, 5 tables, 15 pages</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Planning for Automated Driving using Target Funnels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23795v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-driving vehicles rely on sensory input to monitor their surroundings and continuously adapt to the most likely future road course. Predictive trajectory planning is based on snapshots of the (uncertain) road course as a key input. Under noisy perception data, estimates of the road course can vary significantly, leading to indecisive and erratic steering behavior. To overcome this issue, this paper introduces a predictive trajectory planning algorithm with a novel objective function: instead of targeting a single reference trajectory based on the most likely road course, tracking a series of target reference sets, called a target funnel, is considered. The proposed planning algorithm integrates probabilistic information about the road course, and thus implicitly considers regular updates to road perception. Our solution is assessed in a case study using real driving data collected from a prototype vehicle. The results demonstrate that the algorithm maintains tracking accuracy and substantially reduces undesirable steering commands in the presence of noisy road perception, achieving a 56% reduction in input costs compared to a certainty equivalent formulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to European Control Conference 2025 (ECC25)</p></details> |
| **[Language-Guided Trajectory Traversal in Disentangled Stable Diffusion Latent Space for Factorized Medical Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23623v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated a remarkable ability to generate photorealistic images from natural language prompts. These high-resolution, language-guided synthesized images are essential for the explainability of disease or exploring causal relationships. However, their potential for disentangling and controlling latent factors of variation in specialized domains like medical imaging remains under-explored. In this work, we present the first investigation of the power of pre-trained vision-language foundation models, once fine-tuned on medical image datasets, to perform latent disentanglement for factorized medical image generation and interpolation. Through extensive experiments on chest X-ray and skin datasets, we illustrate that fine-tuned, language-guided Stable Diffusion inherently learns to factorize key attributes for image generation, such as the patient's anatomical structures or disease diagnostic features. We devise a framework to identify, isolate, and manipulate key attributes through latent space trajectory traversal of generative models, facilitating precise control over medical image synthesis.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, existing datasets fall short in capturing the diversity and dynamics of VRU behaviors, making it difficult to meet the research demands of complex traffic environments. To address this gap, this study developed the OnSiteVRU datasets, which cover a variety of scenarios, including intersections, road segments, and urban villages. These datasets provide trajectory data for motor vehicles, electric bicycles, and human-powered bicycles, totaling approximately 17,429 trajectories with a precision of 0.04 seconds. The datasets integrate both aerial-view natural driving data and onboard real-time dynamic detection data, along with environmental information such as traffic signals, obstacles, and real-time maps, enabling a comprehensive reconstruction of interaction events. The results demonstrate that VRU\_Data outperforms traditional datasets in terms of VRU density and scene coverage, offering a more comprehensive representation of VRU behavioral characteristics. This provides critical support for traffic flow modeling, trajectory prediction, and autonomous driving virtual testing.

VT migration is an effective way that migrates the VT when the locations of physical entities keep changing to maintain seamless immersive VT services. However, an efficient VT migration is challenging due to the rapid movement of vehicles, dynamic workloads of Roadside Units (RSUs), and heterogeneous resources of the RSUs. To achieve efficient migration decisions and a minimum latency for the VT migration, we propose a multi-agent split Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework combined with spatio-temporal trajectory generation. In this framework, multiple split DRL agents utilize split architecture to efficiently determine VT migration decisions. Furthermore, we propose a spatio-temporal trajectory generation algorithm based on trajectory datasets and road network data to simulate vehicle trajectories, enhancing the generalization of the proposed scheme for managing VT migration in dynamic network environments. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only enhances the Quality of Experience (QoE) by 29% but also reduces the computational parameter count by approximately 25% while maintaining similar performances, enhancing users' immersive experiences in vehicular metaverses.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches have largely focused on inter-visit event predictions, overlooking the importance of intra-visit nowcasting, which provides prompt clinical insights during an ongoing patient visit. To address this gap, we introduce the task of laboratory measurement prediction within a hospital visit. We study the laboratory data that, however, remained underexplored in previous work. We propose TRACE, a Transformer-based model designed for clinical event nowcasting by encoding patient trajectories. TRACE effectively handles long sequences and captures temporal dependencies through a novel timestamp embedding that integrates decay properties and periodic patterns of data. Additionally, we introduce a smoothed mask for denoising, improving the robustness of the model. Experiments on two large-scale electronic health record datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms previous methods, highlighting its potential for improving patient care through more accurate laboratory measurement nowcasting.

Existing methods also generally predict agents' states without offering any state-wise measure of uncertainty. Moreover, popular multi-modal sampling methods lack any error probability estimates for each generated scene under the same prior observations, making it difficult to rank the predictions during inference time. We introduce U2Diff, a \textbf{unified} diffusion model designed to handle trajectory completion while providing state-wise \textbf{uncertainty} estimates jointly. This uncertainty estimation is achieved by augmenting the simple denoising loss with the negative log-likelihood of the predicted noise and propagating latent space uncertainty to the real state space. Additionally, we incorporate a Rank Neural Network in post-processing to enable \textbf{error probability} estimation for each generated mode, demonstrating a strong correlation with the error relative to ground truth. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions in trajectory completion and forecasting across four challenging sports datasets (NBA, Basketball-U, Football-U, Soccer-U), highlighting the effectiveness of uncertainty and error probability estimation.

| **[Simplification of Trajectory Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23025v1)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While there are software systems that simplify trajectory streams on the fly, few curve simplification algorithms with quality guarantees fit the streaming requirements. We present streaming algorithms for two such problems under the Fr\'{e}chet distance $d_F$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for some constant $d \geq 2$. Consider a polygonal curve $\tau$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ in a stream. We present a streaming algorithm that, for any $\varepsilon\in (0,1)$ and $\delta > 0$, produces a curve $\sigma$ such that $d_F(\sigma,\tau[v_1,v_i])\le (1+\varepsilon)\delta$ and $|\sigma|\le 2\,\mathrm{opt}-2$, where $\tau[v_1,v_i]$ is the prefix in the stream so far, and $\mathrm{opt} = \min\{|\sigma'|: d_F(\sigma',\tau[v_1,v_i])\le \delta\}$. Let $\alpha = 2(d-1){\lfloor d/2 \rfloor}^2 + d$. The working storage is $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha})$. Each vertex is processed in $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for $d \in \{2,3\}$ and $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha})$ time for $d \geq 4$ . Thus, the whole $\tau$ can be simplified in $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha}|\tau|\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time. Ignoring polynomial factors in $1/\varepsilon$, this running time is a factor $|\tau|$ faster than the best static algorithm that offers the same guarantees. We present another streaming algorithm that, for any integer $k \geq 2$ and any $\varepsilon \in (0,\frac{1}{17})$, maintains a curve $\sigma$ such that $|\sigma| \leq 2k-2$ and $d_F(\sigma,\tau[v_1,v_i])\le (1+\varepsilon) \cdot \min\{d_F(\sigma',\tau[v_1,v_i]): |\sigma'| \leq k\}$, where $\tau[v_1,v_i]$ is the prefix in the stream so far. The working storage is $O((k\varepsilon^{-1}+\varepsilon^{-(\alpha+1)})\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$. Each vertex is processed in $O(k\varepsilon^{-(\alpha+1)}\log^2\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for $d \in \{2,3\}$ and $O(k\varepsilon^{-(\alpha+1)}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for $d \geq 4$.</p></details> | SoCG 2025 |

Machine learning algorithms constitute the state-of-the-art in many fields but require vast data sets, which are costly and time-intensive to collect. Automated strategies for observation and exploration are crucial to enhance the efficiency of data gathering. Therefore, a novel strategy utilizing the Next-Best-Trajectory principle is developed for a robot manipulator operating in dynamic environments. Local trajectories are generated to maximize the information gained from observations along the path while avoiding collisions. We employ a voxel map for environment modeling and utilize raycasting from perspectives around a point of interest to estimate the information gain. A global ergodic trajectory planner provides an optional reference trajectory to the local planner, improving exploration and helping to avoid local minima. To enhance computational efficiency, raycasting for estimating the information gain in the environment is executed in parallel on the graphics processing unit. Benchmark results confirm the efficiency of the parallelization, while real-world experiments demonstrate the strategy's effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2025</p></details> |

However, traditional IL methods are limited by their reliance on high-quality, often scarce, expert data, and suffer from covariate shift. To address these challenges, recent advances in offline IL have incorporated suboptimal, unlabeled datasets into the training. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance policy learning from mixed-quality offline datasets by leveraging task-relevant trajectory fragments and rich environmental dynamics. Specifically, we introduce a state-based search framework that stitches state-action pairs from imperfect demonstrations, generating more diverse and informative training trajectories. Experimental results on standard IL benchmarks and real-world robotic tasks showcase that our proposed method significantly improves both generalization and performance.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a reinforcement-learning framework for multi-setpoint and multi-trajectory tracking. Tracking multiple setpoints and time-varying trajectories in reinforcement learning is challenging due to the complexity of balancing multiple objectives, a difficulty further exacerbated by system uncertainties such as uncertain initial conditions and stochastic dynamics. This challenge is relevant, e.g., in bioprocesses involving microbial consortia, where precise control over population compositions is required. We introduce a novel return function based on multiplicative reciprocal saturation functions, which explicitly couples reward gains to the simultaneous satisfaction of multiple references. Through a case study involving light-mediated cybergenetic growth control in microbial consortia, we demonstrate via computational experiments that our approach achieves faster convergence, improved stability, and superior control compliance compared to conventional quadratic-cost-based return functions. Moreover, our method enables tuning of the saturation function's parameters, shaping the learning process and policy updates. By incorporating system uncertainties, our framework also demonstrates robustness, a key requirement in industrial bioprocessing. Overall, this work advances reinforcement-learning-based control strategies in bioprocess engineering, with implications in the broader field of process and systems engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Follow Your Motion: A Generic Temporal Consistency Portrait Editing Framework with Trajectory Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22225v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained conditional diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable potential in image editing. However, they often face challenges with temporal consistency, particularly in the talking head domain, where continuous changes in facial expressions intensify the level of difficulty. These issues stem from the independent editing of individual images and the inherent loss of temporal continuity during the editing process. In this paper, we introduce Follow Your Motion (FYM), a generic framework for maintaining temporal consistency in portrait editing. Specifically, given portrait images rendered by a pre-trained 3D Gaussian Splatting model, we first develop a diffusion model that intuitively and inherently learns motion trajectory changes at different scales and pixel coordinates, from the first frame to each subsequent frame. This approach ensures that temporally inconsistent edited avatars inherit the motion information from the rendered avatars. Secondly, to maintain fine-grained expression temporal consistency in talking head editing, we propose a dynamic re-weighted attention mechanism. This mechanism assigns higher weight coefficients to landmark points in space and dynamically updates these weights based on landmark loss, achieving more consistent and refined facial expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of temporal consistency and can be used to optimize and compensate for temporally inconsistent outputs in a range of applications, such as text-driven editing, relighting, and various other applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://anonymous-hub1127.github.io/FYM.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Multi-modal Knowledge Distillation-based Human Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22201v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory forecasting is crucial in various applications such as autonomous driving and mobile robot navigation. In such applications, camera-based perception enables the extraction of additional modalities (human pose, text) to enhance prediction accuracy. Indeed, we find that textual descriptions play a crucial role in integrating additional modalities into a unified understanding. However, online extraction of text requires the use of VLM, which may not be feasible for resource-constrained systems. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-modal knowledge distillation framework: a student model with limited modality is distilled from a teacher model trained with full range of modalities. The comprehensive knowledge of a teacher model trained with trajectory, human pose, and text is distilled into a student model using only trajectory or human pose as a sole supplement. In doing so, we separately distill the core locomotion insights from intra-agent multi-modality and inter-agent interaction. Our generalizable framework is validated with two state-of-the-art models across three datasets on both ego-view (JRDB, SIT) and BEV-view (ETH/UCY) setups, utilizing both annotated and VLM-generated text captions. Distilled student models show consistent improvement in all prediction metrics for both full and instantaneous observations, improving up to ~13%.

Still, existing methods that perform dragging in the 2D space usually face ambiguity when handling out-of-plane movements. In this work, we augment the interaction with a new dimension, i.e., the depth dimension, such that users are allowed to assign a relative depth for each point on the trajectory. That way, our new interaction paradigm not only inherits the convenience from 2D dragging, but facilitates trajectory control in the 3D space, broadening the scope of creativity. We propose a pioneering method for 3D trajectory control in image-to-video synthesis by abstracting object masks into a few cluster points. These points, accompanied by the depth information and the instance information, are finally fed into a video diffusion model as the control signal. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, dubbed LeviTor, in precisely manipulating the object movements when producing photo-realistic videos from static images.

To this end, we train a video generation model conditioned on spatio-temporally sparse or dense motion trajectories. In contrast to prior motion conditioning work, this flexible representation can encode any number of trajectories, object-specific or global scene motion, and temporally sparse motion; due to its flexibility we refer to this conditioning as motion prompts. While users may directly specify sparse trajectories, we also show how to translate high-level user requests into detailed, semi-dense motion prompts, a process we term motion prompt expansion. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach through various applications, including camera and object motion control, "interacting" with an image, motion transfer, and image editing. Our results showcase emergent behaviors, such as realistic physics, suggesting the potential of motion prompts for probing video models and interacting with future generative world models. Finally, we evaluate quantitatively, conduct a human study, and demonstrate strong performance.

The trajectory planning problem is formulated as an Optimal Control Problem (OCP), which aims to maximize the uncertainty reduction within a specified mission duration. However, this results in an intractable OCP whose objective functional cannot be expressed in closed form. To address this, we propose a Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm based on a relaxed formulation of the objective function to approximate the optimal solutions. This relaxation promotes efficient map exploration by penalizing overlaps in the UAV's visibility regions along the trajectory. The algorithm can produce efficient and smooth trajectories, and it can be efficiently implemented using standard Nonlinear Programming solvers, being suitable for real-time planning. Unlike traditional methods, which often rely on discretizing the mission space and using complex mixed-integer formulations, our approach is computationally efficient and easier to implement. The MPC algorithm is initially assessed in MATLAB, followed by Gazebo simulations and actual experimental tests conducted in an outdoor environment. The results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can generate efficient and smooth trajectories for search and coverage missions.</p></details> |  |

The convex cover consists of a set of polytopes such that the union of the polytopes represents obstacle-free space, allowing us to find trajectories for robots that lie within the convex cover. In order to find the SFC that facilitates trajectory optimization, we iteratively find overlapping polytopes of maximum volumes that include specified waypoints initialized by a geometric or kinematic planner. Constraints at waypoints appear in two alternating stages of a joint optimization problem, which is solved by a novel heuristic-based iterative algorithm with partially distributed variables. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm using a range of parameterized environments and show its applications for two-stage motion planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistency Trajectory Matching for One-Step Generative Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20349v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) approaches achieve commendable performance at the cost of high inference overhead. Therefore, distillation techniques are utilized to accelerate the multi-step teacher model into one-step student model. Nevertheless, these methods significantly raise training costs and constrain the performance of the student model by the teacher model. To overcome these tough challenges, we propose Consistency Trajectory Matching for Super-Resolution (CTMSR), a distillation-free strategy that is able to generate photo-realistic SR results in one step. Concretely, we first formulate a Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory to establish a deterministic mapping from low-resolution (LR) images with noise to high-resolution (HR) images. Then we apply the Consistency Training (CT) strategy to directly learn the mapping in one step, eliminating the necessity of pre-trained diffusion model. To further enhance the performance and better leverage the ground-truth during the training process, we aim to align the distribution of SR results more closely with that of the natural images. To this end, we propose to minimize the discrepancy between their respective PF-ODE trajectories from the LR image distribution by our meticulously designed Distribution Trajectory Matching (DTM) loss, resulting in improved realism of our recovered HR images. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can attain comparable or even superior capabilities on both synthetic and real datasets while maintaining minimal inference latency.</p></details> |  |

However, the performance of FL is often hindered by the unreliable communication links between resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the central server. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel framework that employs an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a mobile server to enhance the FL training process. By capitalizing on the UAV's mobility, we establish strong line-of-sight connections with IoT devices, thereby enhancing communication reliability and capacity. To maximize training efficiency, we formulate a latency minimization problem that jointly optimizes bandwidth allocation, computing frequencies, transmit power for both the UAV and IoT devices, and the UAV's flight trajectory. Subsequently, we analyze the required rounds of the IoT devices training and the UAV aggregation for FL convergence. Based on the convergence constraint, we transform the problem into three subproblems and develop an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to solve this problem effectively. Additionally, we provide a thorough analysis of the algorithm's convergence and computational complexity. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme not only surpasses existing benchmark schemes in reducing latency up to 15.29%, but also achieves training efficiency that nearly matches the ideal scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE</p></details> |

However, existing prediction methods are challenged by the irregular sampling time intervals of the vessel tracking data from the global AIS system and the complexity of vessel movement. These aspects render model learning and generalization difficult. To address these challenges and improve vessel trajectory prediction, we propose the multi-modal knowledge-enhanced framework (MAKER) for vessel trajectory prediction. To contend better with the irregular sampling time intervals, MAKER features a Large language model-guided Knowledge Transfer (LKT) module that leverages pre-trained language models to transfer trajectory-specific contextual knowledge effectively. To enhance the ability to learn complex trajectory patterns, MAKER incorporates a Knowledge-based Self-paced Learning (KSL) module. This module employs kinematic knowledge to progressively integrate complex patterns during training, allowing for adaptive learning and enhanced generalization. Experimental results on two vessel trajectory datasets show that MAKER can improve the prediction accuracy of state-of-the-art methods by 12.08%-17.86%.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Model Predictive Control (MPC), particularly sampling-based approaches such as the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) method, has recently demonstrated considerable success by leveraging parallel computing to efficiently evaluate numerous trajectories. However, MPPI often struggles to balance safe navigation in constrained environments with effective exploration in open spaces, leading to infeasibility in cluttered conditions. To address these limitations, we propose DBaS-Log-MPPI, a novel algorithm that integrates Discrete Barrier States (DBaS) to ensure safety while enabling adaptive exploration with enhanced feasibility. Our method is efficiently validated through three simulation missions and one real-world experiment, involving a 2D quadrotor and a ground vehicle navigating through cluttered obstacles. We demonstrate that our algorithm surpasses both Vanilla MPPI and Log-MPPI, achieving higher success rates, lower tracking errors, and a conservative average speed.</p></details> | IROS 2025 |

Existing methods are designed for specific ball types and struggle to generalize. This challenge arises from three key factors. First, learning-based models require large datasets but suffer from accuracy drops in unseen scenarios. Second, physics-based models rely on complex formulas and detailed inputs, yet accurately obtaining ball states, such as spin, is often impractical. Third, integrating physical principles with neural networks to achieve high accuracy, fast inference, and strong generalization remains difficult. To address these issues, we propose an innovative approach that incorporates physics-based equations and neural networks. We first derive three generalized physical formulas. Then, using a neural network and observed trajectory points, we infer certain parameters while fitting the remaining ones. These formulas enable precise trajectory prediction with minimal training data: only a few dozen samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method superiority in generalization, real-time performance, and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission was made without my advisor's consent, and I mistakenly uploaded an incorrect version of the paper.

Latencies cause misalignments in both spatial and semantic features, complicating the fusion of real-time observations from the ego vehicle with delayed data from others. To address these issues, we propose TraF-Align, a novel framework that learns the flow path of features by predicting the feature-level trajectory of objects from past observations up to the ego vehicle's current time. By generating temporally ordered sampling points along these paths, TraF-Align directs attention from the current-time query to relevant historical features along each trajectory, supporting the reconstruction of current-time features and promoting semantic interaction across multiple frames. This approach corrects spatial misalignment and ensures semantic consistency across agents, effectively compensating for motion and achieving coherent feature fusion. Experiments on two real-world datasets, V2V4Real and DAIR-V2X-Seq, show that TraF-Align sets a new benchmark for asynchronous cooperative perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

By posing the finite-horizon optimal control problem and recursive re-evaluation of the optimal trajectories, minimization of the L2 norms of the state and control errors are transcribed into a quadratic program. Control and state variable constraints are parameterized using Chebyshev polynomials and are accommodated in the optimal trajectory generation programs to incorporate the actuator limits and keep-out constraints. Differentiable collision detection of polytopes is leveraged for optimal collision avoidance.

| **[Trajectory Balance with Asynchrony: Decoupling Exploration and Learning for Fast, Scalable LLM Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18929v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a critical component of large language model (LLM) post-training. However, existing on-policy algorithms used for post-training are inherently incompatible with the use of experience replay buffers, which can be populated scalably by distributed off-policy actors to enhance exploration as compute increases. We propose efficiently obtaining this benefit of replay buffers via Trajectory Balance with Asynchrony (TBA), a massively scalable LLM RL system. In contrast to existing approaches, TBA uses a larger fraction of compute on search, constantly generating off-policy data for a central replay buffer. A training node simultaneously samples data from this buffer based on reward or recency to update the policy using Trajectory Balance (TB), a diversity-seeking RL objective introduced for GFlowNets. TBA offers three key advantages: (1) decoupled training and search, speeding up training wall-clock time by 4x or more; (2) improved diversity through large-scale off-policy sampling; and (3) scalable search for sparse reward settings. On mathematical reasoning, preference-tuning, and automated red-teaming (diverse and representative post-training tasks), TBA produces speed and performance improvements over strong baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[CarPlanner: Consistent Auto-regressive Trajectory Planning for Large-scale Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19908v3)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning is vital for autonomous driving, ensuring safe and efficient navigation in complex environments. While recent learning-based methods, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in specific scenarios, RL planners struggle with training inefficiencies and managing large-scale, real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CarPlanner}, a \textbf{C}onsistent \textbf{a}uto-\textbf{r}egressive \textbf{Planner} that uses RL to generate multi-modal trajectories. The auto-regressive structure enables efficient large-scale RL training, while the incorporation of consistency ensures stable policy learning by maintaining coherent temporal consistency across time steps. Moreover, CarPlanner employs a generation-selection framework with an expert-guided reward function and an invariant-view module, simplifying RL training and enhancing policy performance. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our proposed RL framework effectively addresses the challenges of training efficiency and performance enhancement, positioning CarPlanner as a promising solution for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that the RL-based planner can surpass both IL- and rule-based state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on the challenging large-scale real-world dataset nuPlan. Our proposed CarPlanner surpasses RL-, IL-, and rule-based SOTA approaches within this demanding dataset.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[DiffMove: Group Mobility Tendency Enhanced Trajectory Recovery via Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18302v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the real world, trajectory data is often sparse and incomplete due to low collection frequencies or limited device coverage. Trajectory recovery aims to recover these missing trajectory points, making the trajectories denser and more complete. However, this task faces two key challenges: 1) The excessive sparsity of individual trajectories makes it difficult to effectively leverage historical information for recovery; 2) Sparse trajectories make it harder to capture complex individual mobility preferences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called DiffMove. Firstly, we harness crowd wisdom for trajectory recovery. Specifically, we construct a group tendency graph using the collective trajectories of all users and then integrate the group mobility trends into the location representations via graph embedding. This solves the challenge of sparse trajectories being unable to rely on individual historical trajectories for recovery. Secondly, we capture individual mobility preferences from both historical and current perspectives. Finally, we integrate group mobility tendencies and individual preferences into the spatiotemporal distribution of the trajectory to recover high-quality trajectories. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that DiffMove outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis validates the robustness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Imputation in Multi-Agent Sports with Derivative-Accumulating Self-Ensemble](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10878v3)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent trajectory data collected from domains such as team sports often suffer from missing values due to various factors. While many imputation methods have been proposed for spatiotemporal data, they are not well-suited for multi-agent sports scenarios where player movements are highly dynamic and inter-agent interactions continuously evolve. To address these challenges, we propose MIDAS (Multi-agent Imputer with Derivative-Accumulating Self-ensemble), a framework that imputes multi-agent trajectories with high accuracy and physical plausibility. It jointly predicts positions, velocities, and accelerations through a Set Transformer-based neural network and generates alternative estimates by recursively accumulating predicted velocity and acceleration values. These predictions are then combined using a learnable weighted ensemble to produce final imputed trajectories. Experiments on three sports datasets demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms existing baselines in both positional accuracy and physical plausibility. Lastly, we showcase use cases of MIDAS, such as approximating total distance and pass success probability, to highlight its applicability to practical downstream tasks that require complete tracking data.</p></details> |  |
| **[EF-3DGS: Event-Aided Free-Trajectory 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15392v3)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene reconstruction from casually captured videos has wide applications in real-world scenarios. With recent advancements in differentiable rendering techniques, several methods have attempted to simultaneously optimize scene representations (NeRF or 3DGS) and camera poses. Despite recent progress, existing methods relying on traditional camera input tend to fail in high-speed (or equivalently low-frame-rate) scenarios. Event cameras, inspired by biological vision, record pixel-wise intensity changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution, providing valuable scene and motion information in blind inter-frame intervals. In this paper, we introduce the event camera to aid scene construction from a casually captured video for the first time, and propose Event-Aided Free-Trajectory 3DGS, called EF-3DGS, which seamlessly integrates the advantages of event cameras into 3DGS through three key components. First, we leverage the Event Generation Model (EGM) to fuse events and frames, supervising the rendered views observed by the event stream. Second, we adopt the Contrast Maximization (CMax) framework in a piece-wise manner to extract motion information by maximizing the contrast of the Image of Warped Events (IWE), thereby calibrating the estimated poses. Besides, based on the Linear Event Generation Model (LEGM), the brightness information encoded in the IWE is also utilized to constrain the 3DGS in the gradient domain. Third, to mitigate the absence of color information of events, we introduce photometric bundle adjustment (PBA) to ensure view consistency across events and frames. We evaluate our method on the public Tanks and Temples benchmark and a newly collected real-world dataset, RealEv-DAVIS.

Using data from seven cohorts belonging to the Lifetime Risk Pooling Project (LRPP), we present a Bayesian hierarchical multivariate approach that jointly models multiple longitudinal risk factors over time and across cohorts. Because few cohorts in our project cover the entire adult lifespan, our strategy uses information from all risk factors to increase precision for each risk factor trajectory and borrows information across cohorts to fill in unobserved risk factors. We develop novel diagnostic testing and model validation methods to ensure that our model robustly captures and maintains critical relationships over time and across risk factors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physically-Feasible Reactive Synthesis for Terrain-Adaptive Locomotion via Trajectory Optimization and Symbolic Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03071v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an integrated planning framework for quadrupedal locomotion over dynamically changing, unforeseen terrains. Existing approaches either rely on heuristics for instantaneous foothold selection--compromising safety and versatility--or solve expensive trajectory optimization problems with complex terrain features and long time horizons. In contrast, our framework leverages reactive synthesis to generate correct-by-construction controllers at the symbolic level, and mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) for dynamic and physically feasible footstep planning for each symbolic transition. We use a high-level manager to reduce the large state space in synthesis by incorporating local environment information, improving synthesis scalability. To handle specifications that cannot be met due to dynamic infeasibility, and to minimize costly MICP solves, we leverage a symbolic repair process to generate only necessary symbolic transitions. During online execution, re-running the MICP with real-world terrain data, along with runtime symbolic repair, bridges the gap between offline synthesis and online execution. We demonstrate, in simulation, our framework's capabilities to discover missing locomotion skills and react promptly in safety-critical environments, such as scattered stepping stones and rebars.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiNash-PF: A Particle Filtering Approach for Computing Multiple Local Generalized Nash Equilibria in Trajectory Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05554v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern robotic systems frequently engage in complex multi-agent interactions, many of which are inherently multi-modal, meaning they can lead to multiple distinct outcomes. To interact effectively, robots must recognize the possible interaction modes and adapt to the one preferred by other agents. In this work, we propose an efficient algorithm for capturing the multimodality in multi-agent interactions. We leverage a game-theoretic planner to model interaction outcomes as equilibria where \emph{each equilibrium} corresponds to a distinct interaction \emph{mode}. We then develop an efficient algorithm to identify all the equilibria, allowing robots to reason about multiple interaction modes. More specifically, we formulate interactive planning as Constrained Potential Trajectory Games (CPTGs) and model interaction outcomes by local Generalized Nash equilibria (GNEs) of the game. CPTGs are a class of games for which a local GNE can be found by solving a single constrained optimal control problem where a potential function is minimized. We propose to integrate the potential game approach with implicit particle filtering, a sample-efficient method for non-convex trajectory optimization. We utilize implicit particle filtering to identify the coarse estimates of multiple local minimizers of the game's potential function. MultiNash-PF then refines these estimates with optimization solvers, obtaining different local GNEs. We show through numerical simulations that MultiNash-PF reduces computation time by up to 50\% compared to a baseline. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in real-world human-robot interaction scenarios, where it successfully accounts for the multi-modal nature of interactions and resolves potential conflicts in real-time.</p></details> |  |

However, previous Human Trajectory Prediction (HTP) methods leverage the pose cues implicitly, resulting in implausible predictions. To address this, we propose Locomotion Embodiment, a framework that explicitly evaluates the physical plausibility of the predicted trajectory by locomotion generation under the laws of physics. While the plausibility of locomotion is learned with an indifferentiable physics simulator, it is replaced by our differentiable Locomotion Value function to train an HTP network in a data-driven manner. In particular, our proposed Embodied Locomotion loss is beneficial for efficiently training a stochastic HTP network using multiple heads. Furthermore, the Locomotion Value filter is proposed to filter out implausible trajectories at inference. Experiments demonstrate that our method enhances even the state-of-the-art HTP methods across diverse datasets and problem settings.

To date, machine-learned and human-designed approximations suffer from insufficient accuracy, limited scalability, or dependence on costly reference data. To address these issues, we introduce Equivariant Graph Exchange Correlation (EG-XC), a novel non-local XC functional based on equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs). Where previous works relied on semi-local functionals or fixed-size descriptors of the density, we compress the electron density into an SO(3)-equivariant nuclei-centered point cloud for efficient non-local atomic-range interactions. By applying an equivariant GNN on this point cloud, we capture molecular-range interactions in a scalable and accurate manner. To train EG-XC, we differentiate through a self-consistent field solver requiring only energy targets. In our empirical evaluation, we find EG-XC to accurately reconstruct `gold-standard' CCSD(T) energies on MD17. On out-of-distribution conformations of 3BPA, EG-XC reduces the relative MAE by 35% to 50%. Remarkably, EG-XC excels in data efficiency and molecular size extrapolation on QM9, matching force fields trained on 5 times more and larger molecules. On identical training sets, EG-XC yields on average 51% lower MAEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Representation Learning, 2025</p></details> |

Surrogate models offer a viable solution to reduce this overhead, but they are untested in real-world aerodynamic datasets. We present a comparative evaluation of two surrogate modeling approaches for predicting drag on a real-world dataset: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that uses a signed distance field as input and a commercial tool based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) that directly processes a surface mesh. In contrast to previous studies based on datasets created from parameterized geometries, our dataset comprises 343 geometries derived from 32 baseline vehicle geometries across five distinct car projects, reflecting the diverse, free-form modifications encountered in the typical vehicle development process. Our results show that the CNN-based method achieves a mean absolute error of 2.3 drag counts, while the GNN-based method achieves 3.8. Both methods achieve approximately 77% accuracy in predicting the direction of drag change relative to the baseline geometry. While both methods effectively capture the broader trends between baseline groups (set of samples derived from a single baseline geometry), they struggle to varying extents in capturing the finer intra-baseline group variations. In summary, our findings suggest that aerodynamicists can effectively use both methods to predict drag in under two minutes, which is at least 600 times faster than performing a simulation. However, there remains room for improvement in capturing the finer details of the geometry.</p></details> |  |

The deep learning network for this task relies on historical data inputs, yet real-time data can be corrupted by sensor noise, altering its distribution. We model this noise as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian noise and incorporate it into the LargeST traffic volume dataset, resulting in data with both inherent and additive noise components. Our approach involves decomposing the corrupted signal into modes using variational mode decomposition, followed by feeding the data into a learning pipeline for prediction. We integrate a 3D attention mechanism encompassing spatial, temporal, and channel attention. The spatial and temporal attention modules learn their respective correlations, while the channel attention mechanism is used to suppress noise and highlight the significant modes in the spatiotemporal signals. Additionally, a learnable soft thresholding method is implemented to exclude unimportant modes from the feature vector, and a feature reduction method based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is applied. We compare the performance of our approach against baseline models, demonstrating that our method achieves superior long-term prediction accuracy, robustness to noise, and improved performance with mode truncation compared to the baseline models.

However, recent studies reveal that GNNs often fail to outperform simple MLPs on heterophilous graph tasks, where connected nodes may differ in features or labels, challenging the homophily assumption. Existing methods addressing this issue often overlook the importance of information granularity and rarely consider implicit relationships between distant nodes. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Granular and Implicit Graph Network (GRAIN), a novel GNN model specifically designed for heterophilous graphs. GRAIN enhances node embeddings by aggregating multi-view information at various granularity levels and incorporating implicit data from distant, non-neighboring nodes. This approach effectively integrates local and global information, resulting in smoother, more accurate node representations. We also introduce an adaptive graph information aggregator that efficiently combines multi-granularity and implicit data, significantly improving node representation quality, as shown by experiments on 13 datasets covering varying homophily and heterophily. GRAIN consistently outperforms 12 state-of-the-art models, excelling on both homophilous and heterophilous graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Existing attempts of heterophilous GNNs incorporate long-range or global aggregations to distinguish nodes in the graph. However, these aggregations usually require iteratively maintaining and updating full-graph information, which limits their efficiency when applying to large-scale graphs. In this paper, we propose SIGMA, an efficient global heterophilous GNN aggregation integrating the structural similarity measurement SimRank. Our theoretical analysis illustrates that SIGMA inherently captures distant global similarity even under heterophily, that conventional approaches can only achieve after iterative aggregations. Furthermore, it enjoys efficient one-time computation with a complexity only linear to the node set size $\mathcal{O}(n)$. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that SIGMA achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior aggregation and overall efficiency. Notably, it obtains $5\times$ acceleration on the large-scale heterophily dataset pokec with over 30 million edges compared to the best baseline aggregation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Acceptted to ICDE 2025</p></details> |

In particular, we are interested in learning distributed optimal controllers using graph recurrent neural networks (GRNNs). Most of the existing approaches result in centralized optimal controllers with offline training processes. However, as the increasing demand of network resilience, the optimal controllers are further expected to be distributed, and are desirable to be trained in an online distributed fashion, which are also the main contributions of our work. To solve this problem, we first propose a GRNN-based distributed optimal control method, and we cast the problem as a self-supervised learning problem. Then, the distributed online training is achieved via distributed gradient computation, and inspired by the (consensus-based) distributed optimization idea, a distributed online training optimizer is designed. Furthermore, the local closed-loop stability of the linear networked system under our proposed GRNN-based controller is provided by assuming that the nonlinear activation function of the GRNN-based controller is both local sector-bounded and slope-restricted. The effectiveness of our proposed method is illustrated by numerical simulations using a specifically developed simulator.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

Existing methods like low-rank adaptations (LoRA) are efficient but lack flexibility, while Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures enhance model capacity at the cost of more & under-utilized parameters. To address these limitations, we propose Structural Mixture of Residual Experts (S'MoRE), a novel framework that seamlessly integrates the efficiency of LoRA with the flexibility of MoE. Specifically, S'MoRE employs hierarchical low-rank decomposition of expert weights, yielding residuals of varying orders interconnected in a multi-layer structure. By routing input tokens through sub-trees of residuals, S'MoRE emulates the capacity of many experts by instantiating and assembling just a few low-rank matrices. We craft the inter-layer propagation of S'MoRE's residuals as a special type of Graph Neural Network (GNN), and prove that under similar parameter budget, S'MoRE improves "structural flexibility" of traditional MoE (or Mixture-of-LoRA) by exponential order. Comprehensive theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that S'MoRE achieves superior fine-tuning performance, offering a transformative approach for efficient LLM adaptation.</p></details> |  |

Traditional models often rely on parametric kernels, limiting their ability to capture heterogeneous, nonstationary dynamics. Recent innovations integrate deep neural architectures -- either by modeling the conditional intensity function directly or by learning flexible, data-driven influence kernels, substantially broadening their expressive power. This article reviews the development of the deep influence kernel approach, which enjoys statistical explainability, since the influence kernel remains in the model to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of event influence and its impact on future events, while also possessing strong expressive power, thereby benefiting from both worlds. We explain the main components in developing deep kernel point processes, leveraging tools such as functional basis decomposition and graph neural networks to encode complex spatial or network structures, as well as estimation using both likelihood-based and likelihood-free methods, and address computational scalability for large-scale data. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of kernel identifiability. Simulated and real-data examples highlight applications to crime analysis, earthquake aftershock prediction, and sepsis prediction modeling, and we conclude by discussing promising directions for the field.</p></details> |  |

Distilling Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) teachers into Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) students has emerged as an effective approach to achieve strong performance and reducing computational cost by removing graph dependency. However, existing distillation methods only use standard GNNs and overlook alternative teachers such as specialized model for link prediction (GNN4LP) and heuristic methods (e.g., common neighbors). This paper first explores the impact of different teachers in GNN-to-MLP distillation. Surprisingly, we find that stronger teachers do not always produce stronger students: MLPs distilled from GNN4LP can underperform those distilled from simpler GNNs, while weaker heuristic methods can teach MLPs to near-GNN performance with drastically reduced training costs. Building on these insights, we propose Ensemble Heuristic-Distilled MLPs (EHDM), which eliminates graph dependencies while effectively integrating complementary signals via a gating mechanism. Experiments on ten datasets show an average 7.93% improvement over previous GNN-to-MLP approaches with 1.95-3.32 times less training time, indicating EHDM is an efficient and effective link prediction method.</p></details> |  |

Traditional metaheuristics excel at exploring complex solution spaces efficiently, yet they often struggle with scalability. Deep learning has become a viable alternative for quickly generating high-quality solutions, particularly when metaheuristics underperform. In recent years, quantum-inspired approaches such as tensor networks have shown promise in addressing these challenges. Despite these advancements, a thorough comparison of the different paradigms is missing. This study evaluates eight algorithms on Weighted Max-Cut graphs ranging from 10 to 250 nodes. Specifically, we compare a Genetic Algorithm representing metaheuristics, a Graph Neural Network for deep learning, and the Density Matrix Renormalization Group as a tensor network approach. Our analysis focuses on solution quality and computational efficiency (i.e., time and memory usage). Numerical results show that the Genetic Algorithm achieves near-optimal results for small graphs, although its computation time grows significantly with problem size. The Graph Neural Network offers a balanced solution for medium-sized instances with low memory demands and rapid inference, yet it exhibits more significant variability on larger graphs. Meanwhile, the Tensor Network approach consistently yields high approximation ratios and efficient execution on larger graphs, albeit with increased memory consumption.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, paper Submitted to GECCO '25</p></details> |
| **[Graph Federated Learning Based Proactive Content Caching in Edge Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04760v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of mobile data traffic and the increasing prevalence of video streaming, proactive content caching in edge computing has become crucial for reducing latency and alleviating network congestion. However, traditional caching strategies such as FIFO, LRU, and LFU fail to effectively predict future content popularity, while existing proactive caching approaches often require users to upload data to a central server, raising concerns regarding privacy and scalability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Graph Federated Learning-based Proactive Content Caching (GFPCC) scheme that enhances caching efficiency while preserving user privacy. The proposed approach integrates federated learning and graph neural networks, enabling users to locally train Light Graph Convolutional Networks (LightGCN) to capture user-item relationships and predict content popularity. Instead of sharing raw data, only the trained model parameters are transmitted to the central server, where a federated averaging algorithm aggregates updates, refines the global model, and selects the most popular files for proactive caching. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets, such as MovieLens, demonstrate that GFPCC outperforms baseline caching algorithms by achieving higher cache efficiency through more accurate content popularity predictions. Moreover, the federated learning framework strengthens privacy protection while maintaining efficient model training; however, scalability remains a challenge in large-scale networks with dynamic user preferences.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in autonomous driving, traditional pipelines rely on deterministic models that fail to capture the probabilistic nature and inherent uncertainty of real-world driving. To address this, we propose PRIMEDrive-CoT, a novel uncertainty-aware model for object interaction and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in driving scenarios. In particular, our approach combines LiDAR-based 3D object detection with multi-view RGB references to ensure interpretable and reliable scene understanding. Uncertainty and risk assessment, along with object interactions, are modelled using Bayesian Graph Neural Networks (BGNNs) for probabilistic reasoning under ambiguous conditions. Interpretable decisions are facilitated through CoT reasoning, leveraging object dynamics and contextual cues, while Grad-CAM visualizations highlight attention regions. Extensive evaluations on the DriveCoT dataset demonstrate that PRIMEDrive-CoT outperforms state-of-the-art CoT and risk-aware models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2025 - CVPRW</p></details> |
| **[On the Hölder Stability of Multiset and Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06984v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extensive research efforts have been put into characterizing and constructing maximally separating multiset and graph neural networks. However, recent empirical evidence suggests the notion of separation itself doesn't capture several interesting phenomena. On the one hand, the quality of this separation may be very weak, to the extent that the embeddings of "separable" objects might even be considered identical when using fixed finite precision. On the other hand, architectures which aren't capable of separation in theory, somehow achieve separation when taking the network to be wide enough. In this work, we address both of these issues, by proposing a novel pair-wise separation quality analysis framework which is based on an adaptation of Lipschitz and \Holder{} stability to parametric functions. The proposed framework, which we name \emph{\Holder{} in expectation}, allows for separation quality analysis, without restricting the analysis to embeddings that can separate all the input space simultaneously. We prove that common sum-based models are lower-\Holder{} in expectation, with an exponent that decays rapidly with the network's depth . Our analysis leads to adversarial examples of graphs which can be separated by three 1-WL iterations, but cannot be separated in practice by standard maximally powerful Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). To remedy this, we propose two novel MPNNs with improved separation quality, one of which is lower Lipschitz in expectation. We show these MPNNs can easily classify our adversarial examples, and compare favorably with standard MPNNs on standard graph learning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Substructure-Aware Expert Model for Molecular Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05844v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular property prediction is essential for applications such as drug discovery and toxicity assessment. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising results by modeling molecules as molecular graphs, their reliance on data-driven learning limits their ability to generalize, particularly in the presence of data imbalance and diverse molecular substructures. Existing methods often overlook the varying contributions of different substructures to molecular properties, treating them uniformly. To address these challenges, we propose ASE-Mol, a novel GNN-based framework that leverages a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach for molecular property prediction. ASE-Mol incorporates BRICS decomposition and significant substructure awareness to dynamically identify positive and negative substructures. By integrating a MoE architecture, it reduces the adverse impact of negative motifs while improving adaptability to positive motifs. Experimental results on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASE-Mol achieves state-of-the-art performance, with significant improvements in both accuracy and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Graph neural networks excel at learning graph data, the omnipresent non-Euclidean structure, but often lack the generalization capacity. Hence, graph foundation model is drawing increasing attention, and recent efforts have been made to leverage Large Language Models. On the one hand, existing studies primarily focus on text-attributed graphs, while a wider range of real graphs do not contain fruitful textual attributes. On the other hand, the sequential graph description tailored for the Large Language Model neglects the structural complexity, which is a predominant characteristic of the graph. Such limitations motivate an important question: Can we go beyond Large Language Models, and pretrain a universal model to learn the structural knowledge for any graph? The answer in the language or vision domain is a shared vocabulary. We observe the fact that there also exist shared substructures underlying graph domain, and thereby open a new opportunity of graph foundation model with structural vocabulary. The key innovation is the discovery of a simple yet effective structural vocabulary of trees and cycles, and we explore its inherent connection to Riemannian geometry. Herein, we present a universal pretraining model, RiemannGFM. Concretely, we first construct a novel product bundle to incorporate the diverse geometries of the vocabulary. Then, on this constructed space, we stack Riemannian layers where the structural vocabulary, regardless of specific graph, is learned in Riemannian manifold offering cross-domain transferability. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of RiemannGFM on a diversity of real graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

Among all approaches, Functional Connectome (FC) is the most popular method. Computed by the correlation coefficients between ROI time series, FC is a powerful and computationally efficient way to estimate ROI connectivity. However, it is well known for neglecting structural connections and causality in ROI interactions. Also, FC becomes much more noisy in the short spatio-temporal sliding-window subsequences of fMRI. Effective Connectome (EC) is proposed as a directional alternative, but is difficult to accurately estimate. Furthermore, for optimal GNN performance, usually only a small percentage of the strongest connections are selected as sparse edges, resulting in oversimplification of complex brain connections. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Node Attention Graph Neural Network (STNAGNN) as a data-driven alternative that combines sparse predefined FC with dense data-driven spatio-temporal connections, allowing for flexible and spatio-temporal learning of ROI interaction patterns.</p></details> |  |

Ensemble prediction systems provide probabilistic forecasts but exhibit biases and difficulties in capturing extreme weather. While post-processing techniques aim to enhance forecast accuracy, they rarely focus on precipitation, which exhibits complex spatial dependencies and tail behavior. Our novel framework leverages graph neural networks to post-process ensemble forecasts, specifically modeling the extremes of the underlying distribution. This allows to capture spatial dependencies and improves forecast accuracy for extreme events, thus leading to more reliable forecasts and mitigating risks of extreme precipitation and flooding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper at ICLR 2025 - Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning Workshop (https://www.climatechange.ai/events/iclr2025)</p></details> |
| **[GraphPINE: Graph Importance Propagation for Interpretable Drug Response Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05454v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainability is necessary for many tasks in biomedical research. Recent explainability methods have focused on attention, gradient, and Shapley value. These do not handle data with strong associated prior knowledge and fail to constrain explainability results based on known relationships between predictive features. We propose GraphPINE, a graph neural network (GNN) architecture leveraging domain-specific prior knowledge to initialize node importance optimized during training for drug response prediction. Typically, a manual post-prediction step examines literature (i.e., prior knowledge) to understand returned predictive features. While node importance can be obtained for gradient and attention after prediction, node importance from these methods lacks complementary prior knowledge; GraphPINE seeks to overcome this limitation. GraphPINE differs from other GNN gating methods by utilizing an LSTM-like sequential format. We introduce an importance propagation layer that unifies 1) updates for feature matrix and node importance and 2) uses GNN-based graph propagation of feature values. This initialization and updating mechanism allows for informed feature learning and improved graph representation. We apply GraphPINE to cancer drug response prediction using drug screening and gene data collected for over 5,000 gene nodes included in a gene-gene graph with a drug-target interaction (DTI) graph for initial importance. The gene-gene graph and DTIs were obtained from curated sources and weighted by article count discussing relationships between drugs and genes. GraphPINE achieves a PR-AUC of 0.894 and ROC-AUC of 0.796 across 952 drugs. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GraphPINE-40DE.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Approach to Linking Histology Images with DNA Methylation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05403v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that regulates gene expression by adding methyl groups to DNA. Abnormal methylation patterns can disrupt gene expression and have been linked to cancer development. To quantify DNA methylation, specialized assays are typically used. However, these assays are often costly and have lengthy processing times, which limits their widespread availability in routine clinical practice. In contrast, whole slide images (WSIs) for the majority of cancer patients can be more readily available. As such, given the ready availability of WSIs, there is a compelling need to explore the potential relationship between WSIs and DNA methylation patterns. To address this, we propose an end-to-end graph neural network based weakly supervised learning framework to predict the methylation state of gene groups exhibiting coherent patterns across samples. Using data from three cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) - TCGA-LGG (Brain Lower Grade Glioma), TCGA-GBM (Glioblastoma Multiforme) ($n$=729) and TCGA-KIRC (Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma) ($n$=511) - we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significantly higher AUROC scores than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, by more than $20\%$. We conduct gene set enrichment analyses on the gene groups and show that majority of the gene groups are significantly enriched in important hallmarks and pathways. We also generate spatially enriched heatmaps to further investigate links between histological patterns and DNA methylation states. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explores association of spatially resolved histological patterns with gene group methylation states across multiple cancer types using weakly supervised deep learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Coarse-Grained Dynamics on Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09324v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a Graph Neural Network (GNN) non-Markovian modeling framework to identify coarse-grained dynamical systems on graphs. Our main idea is to systematically determine the GNN architecture by inspecting how the leading term of the Mori-Zwanzig memory term depends on the coarse-grained interaction coefficients that encode the graph topology. Based on this analysis, we found that the appropriate GNN architecture that will account for $K$-hop dynamical interactions has to employ a Message Passing (MP) mechanism with at least $2K$ steps. We also deduce that the memory length required for an accurate closure model decreases as a function of the interaction strength under the assumption that the interaction strength exhibits a power law that decays as a function of the hop distance. Supporting numerical demonstrations on two examples, a heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillator model and a power system, suggest that the proposed GNN architecture can predict the coarse-grained dynamics under fixed and time-varying graph topologies.</p></details> | 43 pages, 12 figures |

Traditional compartmental models often struggle to estimate temporally and spatially varying epidemiological parameters, while deep learning models typically overlook disease transmission dynamics and lack interpretability in the epidemiological context. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Causal Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (CSTGNN), a hybrid framework that integrates a Spatio-Contact SIR model with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of epidemics. Inter-regional human mobility exhibits continuous and smooth spatiotemporal patterns, leading to adjacent graph structures that share underlying mobility dynamics. To model these dynamics, we employ an adaptive static connectivity graph to represent the stable components of human mobility and utilize a temporal dynamics model to capture fluctuations within these patterns. By integrating the adaptive static connectivity graph with the temporal dynamics graph, we construct a dynamic graph that encapsulates the comprehensive properties of human mobility networks. Additionally, to capture temporal trends and variations in infectious disease spread, we introduce a temporal decomposition model to handle temporal dependence. This model is then integrated with a dynamic graph convolutional network for epidemic forecasting. We validate our model using real-world datasets at the provincial level in China and the state level in Germany. Extensive studies demonstrate that our method effectively models the spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious diseases, providing a valuable tool for forecasting and intervention strategies. Furthermore, analysis of the learned parameters offers insights into disease transmission mechanisms, enhancing the interpretability and practical applicability of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 12 figures.

| **[AsyReC: A Multimodal Graph-based Framework for Spatio-Temporal Asymmetric Dyadic Relationship Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05030v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dyadic social relationships, which refer to relationships between two individuals who know each other through repeated interactions (or not), are shaped by shared spatial and temporal experiences. Current computational methods for modeling these relationships face three major challenges: (1) the failure to model asymmetric relationships, e.g., one individual may perceive the other as a friend while the other perceives them as an acquaintance, (2) the disruption of continuous interactions by discrete frame sampling, which segments the temporal continuity of interaction in real-world scenarios, and (3) the limitation to consider periodic behavioral cues, such as rhythmic vocalizations or recurrent gestures, which are crucial for inferring the evolution of dyadic relationships. To address these challenges, we propose AsyReC, a multimodal graph-based framework for asymmetric dyadic relationship classification, with three core innovations: (i) a triplet graph neural network with node-edge dual attention that dynamically weights multimodal cues to capture interaction asymmetries (addressing challenge 1); (ii) a clip-level relationship learning architecture that preserves temporal continuity, enabling fine-grained modeling of real-world interaction dynamics (addressing challenge 2); and (iii) a periodic temporal encoder that projects time indices onto sine/cosine waveforms to model recurrent behavioral patterns (addressing challenge 3). Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, while ablation studies validate the critical role of asymmetric interaction modeling and periodic temporal encoding in improving the robustness of dyadic relationship classification in real-world scenarios.

| **[STREAK: Streaming Network for Continual Learning of Object Relocations under Household Context Drifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05549v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world settings, robots are expected to assist humans across diverse tasks and still continuously adapt to dynamic changes over time. For example, in domestic environments, robots can proactively help users by fetching needed objects based on learned routines, which they infer by observing how objects move over time. However, data from these interactions are inherently non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-i.i.d.), e.g., a robot assisting multiple users may encounter varying data distributions as individuals follow distinct habits. This creates a challenge: integrating new knowledge without catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose STREAK (Spatio Temporal RElocation with Adaptive Knowledge retention), a continual learning framework for real-world robotic learning. It leverages a streaming graph neural network with regularization and rehearsal techniques to mitigate context drifts while retaining past knowledge. Our method is time- and memory-efficient, enabling long-term learning without retraining on all past data, which becomes infeasible as data grows in real-world interactions. We evaluate STREAK on the task of incrementally predicting human routines over 50+ days across different households. Results show that it effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting while maintaining generalization, making it a scalable solution for long-term human-robot interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contextualized Messages Boost Graph Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12529v4)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant attention in recent years for their ability to process data that may be represented as graphs. This has prompted several studies to explore their representational capability based on the graph isomorphism task. Notably, these works inherently assume a countable node feature representation, potentially limiting their applicability. Interestingly, only a few study GNNs with uncountable node feature representation. In the paper, a new perspective on the representational capability of GNNs is investigated across all levels$\unicode{x2014}$node-level, neighborhood-level, and graph-level$\unicode{x2014}$when the space of node feature representation is uncountable. Specifically, the injective and metric requirements of previous works are softly relaxed by employing a pseudometric distance on the space of input to create a soft-injective function such that distinct inputs may produce similar outputs if and only if the pseudometric deems the inputs to be sufficiently similar on some representation. As a consequence, a simple and computationally efficient soft-isomorphic relational graph convolution network (SIR-GCN) that emphasizes the contextualized transformation of neighborhood feature representations via anisotropic and dynamic message functions is proposed. Furthermore, a mathematical discussion on the relationship between SIR-GCN and key GNNs in literature is laid out to put the contribution into context, establishing SIR-GCN as a generalization of classical GNN methodologies. To close, experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate the relative superiority of SIR-GCN, outperforming comparable models in node and graph property prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research</p></details> |
| **[Boosting Relational Deep Learning with Pretrained Tabular Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04934v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational databases, organized into tables connected by primary-foreign key relationships, are a common format for organizing data. Making predictions on relational data often involves transforming them into a flat tabular format through table joins and feature engineering, which serve as input to tabular methods. However, designing features that fully capture complex relational patterns remains challenging. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a compelling alternative by inherently modeling these relationships, but their time overhead during inference limits their applicability for real-time scenarios. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by leveraging existing feature engineering efforts to enhance the efficiency of GNNs in relational databases. Specifically, we use GNNs to capture complex relationships within relational databases, patterns that are difficult to featurize, while employing engineered features to encode temporal information, thereby avoiding the need to retain the entire historical graph and enabling the use of smaller, more efficient graphs. Our \textsc{LightRDL} approach not only improves efficiency, but also outperforms existing models. Experimental results on the RelBench benchmark demonstrate that our framework achieves up to $33\%$ performance improvement and a $526\times$ inference speedup compared to GNNs, making it highly suitable for real-time inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attentional Graph Meta-Learning for Indoor Localization Using Extremely Sparse Fingerprints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04829v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fingerprint-based indoor localization is often labor-intensive due to the need for dense grids and repeated measurements across time and space. Maintaining high localization accuracy with extremely sparse fingerprints remains a persistent challenge. Existing benchmark methods primarily rely on the measured fingerprints, while neglecting valuable spatial and environmental characteristics. In this paper, we propose a systematic integration of an Attentional Graph Neural Network (AGNN) model, capable of learning spatial adjacency relationships and aggregating information from neighboring fingerprints, and a meta-learning framework that utilizes datasets with similar environmental characteristics to enhance model training. To minimize the labor required for fingerprint collection, we introduce two novel data augmentation strategies: 1) unlabeled fingerprint augmentation using moving platforms, which enables the semi-supervised AGNN model to incorporate information from unlabeled fingerprints, and 2) synthetic labeled fingerprint augmentation through environmental digital twins, which enhances the meta-learning framework through a practical distribution alignment, which can minimize the feature discrepancy between synthetic and real-world fingerprints effectively. By integrating these novel modules, we propose the Attentional Graph Meta-Learning (AGML) model. This novel model combines the strengths of the AGNN model and the meta-learning framework to address the challenges posed by extremely sparse fingerprints. To validate our approach, we collected multiple datasets from both consumer-grade WiFi devices and professional equipment across diverse environments. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the AGML model-based localization method consistently outperforms all baseline methods using sparse fingerprints across all evaluated metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attentional Graph Neural Network Is All You Need for Robust Massive Network Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16856v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we design Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with attention mechanisms to tackle an important yet challenging nonlinear regression problem: massive network localization. We first review our previous network localization method based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), which can exhibit state-of-the-art localization accuracy, even under severe Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) conditions, by carefully preselecting a constant threshold for determining adjacency. As an extension, we propose a specially designed Attentional GNN (AGNN) model to resolve the sensitive thresholding issue of the GCN-based method and enhance the underlying model capacity. The AGNN comprises an Adjacency Learning Module (ALM) and Multiple Graph Attention Layers (MGAL), employing distinct attention architectures to systematically address the demerits of the GCN-based method, rendering it more practical for real-world applications. Comprehensive analyses are conducted to explain the superior performance of these methods, including a theoretical analysis of the AGNN's dynamic attention property and computational complexity, along with a systematic discussion of their robust characteristic against NLOS measurements. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the GCN-based and AGNN-based network localization methods. Notably, integrating attention mechanisms into the AGNN yields substantial improvements in localization accuracy, approaching the fundamental lower bound and showing approximately 37\% to 53\% reduction in localization error compared to the vanilla GCN-based method across various NLOS noise configurations. Both methods outperform all competing approaches by far in terms of localization accuracy, robustness, and computational time, especially for considerably large network sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bidirectional Hierarchical Protein Multi-Modal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04770v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Protein representation learning is critical for numerous biological tasks. Recently, large transformer-based protein language models (pLMs) pretrained on large scale protein sequences have demonstrated significant success in sequence-based tasks. However, pLMs lack structural information. Conversely, graph neural networks (GNNs) designed to leverage 3D structural information have shown promising generalization in protein-related prediction tasks, but their effectiveness is often constrained by the scarcity of labeled structural data. Recognizing that sequence and structural representations are complementary perspectives of the same protein entity, we propose a multimodal bidirectional hierarchical fusion framework to effectively merge these modalities. Our framework employs attention and gating mechanisms to enable effective interaction between pLMs-generated sequential representations and GNN-extracted structural features, improving information exchange and enhancement across layers of the neural network. Based on the framework, we further introduce local Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with gating and global Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with multihead self-attention approaches. Through extensive experiments on a diverse set of protein-related tasks, our method demonstrates consistent improvements over strong baselines and existing fusion techniques in a variety of protein representation learning benchmarks, including react (enzyme/EC classification), model quality assessment (MQA), protein-ligand binding affinity prediction (LBA), protein-protein binding site prediction (PPBS), and B cell epitopes prediction (BCEs). Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art for multimodal protein representation learning, emphasizing the efficacy of BIHIERARCHICAL FUSION in bridging sequence and structural modalities.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional statistical methods struggle with nonlinear effects, while machine learning models often fail to capture geographical (nearby areas being more similar) and topological (unequal connectivity between places) effects in an interpretable way. To address this, we propose MedGNN, a spatio-topologically explicit framework that constructs a 2-hop spatial graph, integrating positional and locational node embeddings with urban characteristics in a graph neural network. Applied to MEDSAT, a comprehensive dataset covering over 150 environmental and socio-demographic factors and six prescription outcomes (depression, anxiety, diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and opioids) across 4,835 Greater London neighborhoods, MedGNN improved predictions by over 25% on average compared to baseline methods. Using depression prescriptions as a case study, we analyzed graph embeddings via geographical principal component analysis, identifying findings that: align with prior research (e.g., higher antidepressant prescriptions among older and White populations), contribute to ongoing debates (e.g., greenery linked to higher and NO2 to lower prescriptions), and warrant further study (e.g., canopy evaporation correlated with fewer prescriptions). These results demonstrate MedGNN's potential, and more broadly, of carefully applied machine learning, to advance transdisciplinary public health research.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages' main content.

| **[Sparsity-Aware Communication for Distributed Graph Neural Network Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04673v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a computationally efficient method to learn embeddings and classifications on graph data. However, GNN training has low computational intensity, making communication costs the bottleneck for scalability. Sparse-matrix dense-matrix multiplication (SpMM) is the core computational operation in full-graph training of GNNs. Previous work parallelizing this operation focused on sparsity-oblivious algorithms, where matrix elements are communicated regardless of the sparsity pattern. This leads to a predictable communication pattern that can be overlapped with computation and enables the use of collective communication operations at the expense of wasting significant bandwidth by communicating unnecessary data. We develop sparsity-aware algorithms that tackle the communication bottlenecks in GNN training with three novel approaches. First, we communicate only the necessary matrix elements. Second, we utilize a graph partitioning model to reorder the matrix and drastically reduce the amount of communicated elements. Finally, we address the high load imbalance in communication with a tailored partitioning model, which minimizes both the total communication volume and the maximum sending volume. We further couple these sparsity-exploiting approaches with a communication-avoiding approach (1.5D parallel SpMM) in which submatrices are replicated to reduce communication. We explore the tradeoffs of these combined optimizations and show up to 14X improvement on 256 GPUs and on some instances reducing communication to almost zero resulting in a communication-free parallel training relative to a popular GNN framework based on communication-oblivious SpMM.</p></details> |  |

Traditional track reconstruction algorithms scale poorly with the number of particles within the accelerator. The Exa.TrkX project, to alleviate this computational burden, introduces a pipeline that reduces particle track reconstruction to edge classification on a graph, and uses graph neural networks (GNNs) to produce particle tracks. However, this GNN-based approach is memory-prohibitive and skips graphs that would exceed GPU memory. We introduce improvements to the Exa.TrkX pipeline to train on samples of input particle graphs, and show that these improvements generalize to higher precision and recall. In addition, we adapt performance optimizations, introduced for GNN training, to fit our augmented Exa.TrkX pipeline. These optimizations provide a $2\times$ speedup over our baseline implementation in PyTorch Geometric.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Network (GNN) execution involves both compute-intensive and memory-intensive kernels, the latter dominates the total time, being significantly bottlenecked by data movement between memory and processors. Processing-In-Memory (PIM) systems can alleviate this data movement bottleneck by placing simple processors near or inside to memory arrays. In this work, we introduce PyGim, an efficient ML library that accelerates GNNs on real PIM systems. We propose intelligent parallelization techniques for memory-intensive kernels of GNNs tailored for real PIM systems, and develop handy Python API for them. We provide hybrid GNN execution, in which the compute-intensive and memory-intensive kernels are executed in processor-centric and memory-centric computing systems, respectively. We extensively evaluate PyGim on a real-world PIM system with 1992 PIM cores using emerging GNN models, and demonstrate that it outperforms its state-of-the-art CPU counterpart on Intel Xeon by on average 3.04x, and achieves higher resource utilization than CPU and GPU systems.

Most solutions to this problem remain confined to the task of node classification. In this article, we focus on the valuable task of link prediction under heterophily, an interesting problem for recommendation systems, social network analysis, and other applications. GNNs like GRAFF have improved node classification under heterophily by incorporating physics biases in the architecture. Similarly, we propose GRAFF-LP, an extension of GRAFF for link prediction. We show that GRAFF-LP effectively discriminates existing from non-existing edges by learning implicitly to separate the edge gradients. Based on this information, we propose a new readout function inspired by physics. Remarkably, this new function not only enhances the performance of GRAFF-LP but also improves that of other baseline models, leading us to reconsider how every link prediction experiment has been conducted so far. Finally, we provide evidence that even simple GNNs did not experience greater difficulty in predicting heterophilic links compared to homophilic ones.

| **[Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems with Decentralized Baseband Processing: Integrating Local Reconstruction with Global Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17059v3)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation problem for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems with a hybrid analog-digital architecture, implemented within a decentralized baseband processing (DBP) framework with a star topology. Existing centralized and fully decentralized channel estimation methods face limitations due to excessive computational complexity or degraded performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage channel estimation scheme that integrates local sparse reconstruction with global fusion and refinement. Specifically, in the first stage, by exploiting the sparsity of channels in the angular-delay domain, the local reconstruction task is formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem. To solve it, we develop a graph neural networks-enhanced sparse Bayesian learning (SBL-GNNs) algorithm, which effectively captures dependencies among channel coefficients, significantly improving estimation accuracy. In the second stage, the local estimates from the local processing units (LPUs) are aligned into a global angular domain for fusion at the central processing unit (CPU). Based on the aggregated observations, the channel refinement is modeled as a Bayesian denoising problem. To efficiently solve it, we devise a variational message passing algorithm that incorporates a Markov chain-based hierarchical sparse prior, effectively leveraging both the sparsity and the correlations of the channels in the global angular-delay domain. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SBL-GNNs algorithm over existing methods, demonstrating improved estimation performance and reduced computational complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE journal for possible publication.

However, they struggle with long-range dependencies in fluid flows, particularly in refined mesh regions. This challenge, known as the 'over-squashing' problem, hinders information propagation. While existing graph rewiring methods address this issue to some extent, they only consider graph topology, overlooking the underlying physical phenomena. We propose Physics-Informed Ollivier-Ricci Flow (PIORF), a novel rewiring method that combines physical correlations with graph topology. PIORF uses Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC) to identify bottleneck regions and connects these areas with nodes in high-velocity gradient nodes, enabling long-range interactions and mitigating over-squashing. Our approach is computationally efficient in rewiring edges and can scale to larger simulations. Experimental results on 3 fluid dynamics benchmark datasets show that PIORF consistently outperforms baseline models and existing rewiring methods, achieving up to 26.2 improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

Traditional CNNs excel at extracting rich spatial features from images but lack the inherent capability to model inter-object relationships. Conversely, conventional GNNs typically rely on flattened node features, thereby discarding vital spatial details. TGraphX overcomes these limitations by employing CNNs to generate multi-dimensional node features (e.g., (3*128*128) tensors) that preserve local spatial semantics. These spatially aware nodes participate in a graph where message passing is performed using 1*1 convolutions, which fuse adjacent features while maintaining their structure. Furthermore, a deep CNN aggregator with residual connections is used to robustly refine the fused messages, ensuring stable gradient flow and end-to-end trainability. Our approach not only bridges the gap between spatial feature extraction and relational reasoning but also demonstrates significant improvements in object detection refinement and ensemble reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to arXiv.

Current strategies for processing point clouds typically downsample the scene or divide it into smaller parts for separate analysis. However, both approaches risk losing key local details or global contextual information. In this paper, we introduce PerLA, a 3D language assistant designed to be more perceptive to both details and context, making visual representations more informative for the LLM. PerLA captures high-resolution (local) details in parallel from different point cloud areas and integrates them with (global) context obtained from a lower-resolution whole point cloud. We present a novel algorithm that preserves point cloud locality through the Hilbert curve and effectively aggregates local-to-global information via cross-attention and a graph neural network. Lastly, we introduce a novel loss for local representation consensus to promote training stability. PerLA outperforms state-of-the-art 3D language assistants, with gains of up to +1.34 CiDEr on ScanQA for question answering, and +4.22 on ScanRefer and +3.88 on Nr3D for dense captioning. https://gfmei.github.io/PerLA/</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

For this reason, reducing the number of two-qubit gates is of paramount importance on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. To advance towards more reliable quantum computing, we introduce a framework based on ZX calculus, graph-neural networks and reinforcement learning for quantum circuit optimization. By combining reinforcement learning and tree search, our method addresses the challenge of selecting optimal sequences of ZX calculus rewrite rules. Instead of relying on existing heuristic rules for minimizing circuits, our method trains a novel reinforcement learning policy that directly operates on ZX-graphs, therefore allowing us to search through the space of all possible circuit transformations to find a circuit significantly minimizing the number of CNOT gates. This way we can scale beyond hard-coded rules towards discovering arbitrary optimization rules. We demonstrate our method's competetiveness with state-of-the-art circuit optimizers and generalization capabilities on large sets of diverse random circuits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proximal Policy Optimization with Graph Neural Networks for Optimal Power Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12470v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is a very traditional research area within the power systems field that seeks for the optimal operation point of electric power plants, and which needs to be solved every few minutes in real-world scenarios. However, due to the nonconvexities that arise in power generation systems, there is not yet a fast, robust solution technique for the full Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF). In the last decades, power grids have evolved into a typical dynamic, non-linear and large-scale control system, known as the power system, so searching for better and faster ACOPF solutions is becoming crucial. Appearance of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) has allowed the natural use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms on graph data, such as power networks. On the other hand, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is known for its powerful capability to solve complex decision-making problems. Although solutions that use these two methods separately are beginning to appear in the literature, none has yet combined the advantages of both. We propose a novel architecture based on the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm with Graph Neural Networks to solve the Optimal Power Flow. The objective is to design an architecture that learns how to solve the optimization problem and that is at the same time able to generalize to unseen scenarios. We compare our solution with the DCOPF in terms of cost after having trained our DRL agent on IEEE 30 bus system and then computing the OPF on that base network with topology changes</p></details> |  |
| **[Certified Defense on the Fairness of Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02757v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a prominent graph learning model in various graph-based tasks over the years. Nevertheless, due to the vulnerabilities of GNNs, it has been empirically proved that malicious attackers could easily corrupt the fairness level of their predictions by adding perturbations to the input graph data. In this paper, we take crucial steps to study a novel problem of certifiable defense on the fairness level of GNNs. Specifically, we propose a principled framework named ELEGANT and present a detailed theoretical certification analysis for the fairness of GNNs. ELEGANT takes any GNNs as its backbone, and the fairness level of such a backbone is theoretically impossible to be corrupted under certain perturbation budgets for attackers. Notably, ELEGANT does not have any assumption over the GNN structure or parameters, and does not require re-training the GNNs to realize certification. Hence it can serve as a plug-and-play framework for any optimized GNNs ready to be deployed. We verify the satisfactory effectiveness of ELEGANT in practice through extensive experiments on real-world datasets across different backbones of GNNs, where ELEGANT is also demonstrated to be beneficial for GNN debiasing.

Despite these advancements, the performance of GNNs on heterogeneous graphs often remains complex, with networks generally underperforming compared to their homogeneous counterparts. This work benchmarks various GNN architectures to identify the most effective methods for heterogeneous graphs, with a particular focus on node classification and link prediction. Our findings reveal that graph attention networks excel in these tasks. As a main contribution, we explore enhancements to these attention networks by integrating positional encodings for node embeddings. This involves utilizing the full Laplacian spectrum to accurately capture both the relative and absolute positions of each node within the graph, further enhancing performance on downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

We apply the proposed MI-HGNN to two contact perception problems, and conduct extensive experiments using both real-world and simulated data collected using two quadruped robots. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of effectiveness, generalization ability, model efficiency, and sample efficiency. Our MI-HGNN improved the performance of a state-of-the-art model that leverages robot morphological symmetry by 8.4% with only 0.21% of its parameters.

| **[A Hybrid Similarity-Aware Graph Neural Network with Transformer for Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02615v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node classification has gained significant importance in graph deep learning with real-world applications such as recommendation systems, drug discovery, and citation networks. Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Transformers have achieved superior performance in node classification tasks. However, the key concern with Graph Convolutional Networks is over-squashing, which limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies in the network. Additionally, Graph Transformers face scalability challenges, making it difficult to process large graphs efficiently. To address this, we propose a novel framework, A Hybrid SImilarity-Aware Graph Neural Network with Transformer for Node Classification (SIGNNet), which capitalizes on local and global structural information, enhances the model's capability to effectively capture fine-grained relationships and broader contextual patterns within the graph structure. The proposed method leverages Graph Convolutional Networks alongside a score-based mechanism to effectively capture local and global node interactions while addressing the limitations of over-squashing. Our proposed method employs a novel Personalized PageRank-based node sampling method to address scalability issues by generating subgraphs of nodes. Additionally, SIGNNet incorporates a novel attention mechanism, Structure-Aware Multi-Head Attention (SA-MHA), which integrates node structural information for informed attention weighting, enabling the model to prioritize nodes based on topological significance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant improvements achieved by the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art methods, with average accuracy gains of 6.03%, 5.47%, 4.78%, 19.10%, 19.61%, 7.22%, 19.54%, and 14.94% on Cora, Citeseer, CS, Wisconsin, Texas, Actor, Cornell and Chameleon datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward General and Robust LLM-enhanced Text-attributed Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02343v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and the proliferation of Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) across various domains have positioned LLM-enhanced TAG learning as a critical research area. By utilizing rich graph descriptions, this paradigm leverages LLMs to generate high-quality embeddings, thereby enhancing the representational capacity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, the field faces significant challenges: (1) the absence of a unified framework to systematize the diverse optimization perspectives arising from the complex interactions between LLMs and GNNs, and (2) the lack of a robust method capable of handling real-world TAGs, which often suffer from texts and edge sparsity, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose UltraTAG, a unified pipeline for LLM-enhanced TAG learning. UltraTAG provides a unified comprehensive and domain-adaptive framework that not only organizes existing methodologies but also paves the way for future advancements in the field. Building on this framework, we propose UltraTAG-S, a robust instantiation of UltraTAG designed to tackle the inherent sparsity issues in real-world TAGs. UltraTAG-S employs LLM-based text propagation and text augmentation to mitigate text sparsity, while leveraging LLM-augmented node selection techniques based on PageRank and edge reconfiguration strategies to address edge sparsity. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraTAG-S significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving improvements of 2.12\% and 17.47\% in ideal and sparse settings, respectively. Moreover, as the data sparsity ratio increases, the performance improvement of UltraTAG-S also rises, which underscores the effectiveness and robustness of UltraTAG-S.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Customer Contact Efficiency with Graph Neural Networks in Credit Card Fraud Detection Workflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02275v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Credit card fraud has been a persistent issue since the last century, causing significant financial losses to the industry. The most effective way to prevent fraud is by contacting customers to verify suspicious transactions. However, while these systems are designed to detect fraudulent activity, they often mistakenly flag legitimate transactions, leading to unnecessary declines that disrupt the user experience and erode customer trust. Frequent false positives can frustrate customers, resulting in dissatisfaction, increased complaints, and a diminished sense of security. To address these limitations, we propose a fraud detection framework incorporating Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (RGCN) to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of identifying fraudulent transactions. By leveraging the relational structure of transaction data, our model reduces the need for direct customer confirmation while maintaining high detection performance. Our experiments are conducted using the IBM credit card transaction dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach.</p></details> |  |

While user-written comments provide explicit insights about preferences, merging these textual representations from large language models (LLMs) with graph-based embeddings of user actions remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose a framework that employs both a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based model and an LLM to produce review-aware representations, preserving review semantics while mitigating textual noise. Our approach utilizes a hybrid objective that balances user-item interactions against text-derived features, ensuring that user's both behavioral and linguistic signals are effectively captured. We evaluate this method on multiple datasets from diverse application domains, demonstrating consistent improvements over a baseline GNN-based recommender model. Notably, our model achieves significant gains in recommendation accuracy when review data is sparse or unevenly distributed. These findings highlight the importance of integrating LLM-driven textual feedback with GNN-derived user behavioral patterns to develop robust, context-aware recommender systems.</p></details> | Under Review |

Hierarchical variants offer a distinct advantage by analysing the time series across multiple resolutions, making them particularly effective in tasks like global weather forecasting, where low-resolution variable interactions are significant. A critical challenge in hierarchical models is information loss during forward or backward passes through the hierarchy. We propose the Hierarchical Graph Flow (HiGFlow) network, which introduces a memory buffer variable of dynamic size to store previously seen information across variable resolutions. We theoretically show two key results: HiGFlow reduces smoothness when mapping onto new feature spaces in the hierarchy and non-strictly enhances the utility of message-passing by improving Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) expressivity. Empirical results demonstrate that HiGFlow outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including transformer models, by at least an average of 6.1% in MAE and 6.2% in RMSE.

These systems evolve under influences such as age, sex, diet, environmental exposures, and diseases, making them challenging to decode given the involvement of tens of thousands of genes and proteins. Recently, hundreds of millions of single-cell omics data have provided a robust foundation for understanding these signaling networks within various cell subpopulations and conditions. Inspired by the success of large foundation models (for example, large language models and large vision models) pre-trained on massive datasets, we introduce OmniCellTOSG, the first dataset of cell text-omic signaling graphs (TOSGs). Each TOSG represents the signaling network of an individual or meta-cell and is labeled with information such as organ, disease, sex, age, and cell subtype. OmniCellTOSG offers two key contributions. First, it introduces a novel graph model that integrates human-readable annotations -- such as biological functions, cellular locations, signaling pathways, related diseases, and drugs -- with quantitative gene and protein abundance data, enabling graph reasoning to decode cell signaling. This approach calls for new joint models combining large language models and graph neural networks. Second, the dataset is built from single-cell RNA sequencing data of approximately 120 million cells from diverse tissues and conditions (healthy and diseased) and is fully compatible with PyTorch. This facilitates the development of innovative cell signaling models that could transform research in life sciences, healthcare, and precision medicine. The OmniCellTOSG dataset is continuously expanding and will be updated regularly. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/FuhaiLiAiLab/OmniCellTOSG.</p></details> |  |

Current methods often struggle with sparse or noisy data and rely on static graphs, limiting their ability to capture dynamic changes between nodes and relationships. This paper introduces LL4G, a self-supervised framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to optimize graph neural networks (GNNs). LLMs extract rich semantic features to generate node representations and to infer explicit and implicit relationships. The graph structure adaptively adds nodes and edges based on input data, continuously optimizing itself. The GNN then uses these optimized representations for joint training on node reconstruction, edge prediction, and contrastive learning tasks. This integration of semantic and structural information generates robust personality profiles. Experimental results on Kaggle and Pandora datasets show LL4G outperforms state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Text to Graph: Leveraging Graph Neural Networks for Enhanced Explainability in NLP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02064v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers have relegated natural language processing tasks to Transformer-type models, particularly generative models, because these models exhibit high versatility when performing generation and classification tasks. As the size of these models increases, they achieve outstanding results. Given their widespread use, many explainability techniques are developed based on these models. However, this process becomes computationally expensive due to the large size of the models. Additionally, transformers interpret input information through tokens that fragment input words into sequences lacking inherent semantic meaning, complicating the explanation of the model from the very beginning. This study proposes a novel methodology to achieve explainability in natural language processing tasks by automatically converting sentences into graphs and maintaining semantics through nodes and relations that express fundamental linguistic concepts. It also allows the subsequent exploitation of this knowledge in subsequent tasks, making it possible to obtain trends and understand how the model associates the different elements inside the text with the explained task. The experiments delivered promising results in determining the most critical components within the text structure for a given classification.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Abusive Language Detection (ALD) models often overlook this context, which can lead to unreliable performance metrics. Recent Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods that integrate conversational context often depend on limited and simplified representations, and report inconsistent results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that utilize graph neural networks (GNNs) to model social media conversations as graphs, where nodes represent comments, and edges capture reply structures. We systematically investigate various graph representations and context windows to identify the optimal configuration for ALD. Our GNN model outperform both context-agnostic baselines and linear context-aware methods, achieving significant improvements in F1 scores. These findings demonstrate the critical role of structured conversational context and establish GNNs as a robust framework for advancing context-aware abusive language detection.</p></details> |  |

We train them to predict spatial position of points in a discrete 2D grid from a set of constraints that uniquely describe hidden figures containing these points. Both models are able to predict the position of points and interestingly, they form the hidden figures described by the input constraints in the embedding space during the reasoning process. Our analysis shows that both models recover the grid structure during training so that the embeddings corresponding to the points within the grid organize themselves in a 2D subspace and reflect the neighborhood structure of the grid. We also show that the Graph Neural Network we design for the task performs significantly better than the Transformer and is also easier to scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Representation Learning via Causal Diffusion for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00490v4)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based recommendation algorithms typically assume that training and testing data are drawn from independent and identically distributed (IID) spaces. However, this assumption often fails in the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, resulting in significant performance degradation. In this study, we construct a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to analyze interaction data, revealing that environmental confounders (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) lead to unstable correlations in GNN-based models, thus impairing their generalization to OOD data. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, graph representation learning via causal diffusion (CausalDiffRec) for OOD recommendation. This method enhances the model's generalization on OOD data by eliminating environmental confounding factors and learning invariant graph representations. Specifically, we use backdoor adjustment and variational inference to infer the real environmental distribution, thereby eliminating the impact of environmental confounders. This inferred distribution is then used as prior knowledge to guide the representation learning in the reverse phase of the diffusion process to learn the invariant representation. In addition, we provide a theoretical derivation that proves optimizing the objective function of CausalDiffRec can encourage the model to learn environment-invariant graph representations, thereby achieving excellent generalization performance in recommendations under distribution shifts. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CausalDiffRec in improving the generalization of OOD data, and the average improvement is up to 10.69% on Food, 18.83% on KuaiRec, 22.41% on Yelp2018, and 11.65% on Douban datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, accepted by WWW2025</p></details> |

In recent years, various studies in the vision domain have made notable advancements in this area. However, the varying topological structures and non-grid nature of graph data render the methods from the vision domain ineffective. Building upon prior research into differentiable methods for graph neural networks, we propose a fast and high-quality data-free knowledge distillation approach in this paper. Without compromising distillation quality, the proposed graph-free KD method (ACGKD) significantly reduces the spatial complexity of pseudo-graphs by leveraging the Binary Concrete distribution to model the graph structure and introducing a spatial complexity tuning parameter. This approach enables efficient gradient computation for the graph structure, thereby accelerating the overall distillation process. Additionally, ACGKD eliminates the dimensional ambiguity between the student and teacher models by increasing the student's dimensions and reusing the teacher's classifier. Moreover, it equips graph knowledge distillation with a CL-based strategy to ensure the student learns graph structures progressively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACGKD achieves state-of-the-art performance in distilling knowledge from GNNs without training data.</p></details> |  |

The conventional approaches extended from optimization perspectives are usually quite involved, especially when jointly considering factors in different scales such as deployment and transmission in UAV-related scenarios. In this paper, we address the UAV-enabled multi-user secure communications by proposing a deep graph reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we reinterpret the security beamforming as a graph neural network (GNN) learning task, where mutual interference among users is managed through the message-passing mechanism. Then, the UAV deployment is obtained through soft actor-critic reinforcement learning, where the GNN-based security beamforming is exploited to guide the deployment strategy update. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal security performance and significantly enhances the efficiency of strategy determination. Moreover, the deep graph reinforcement learning framework offers a scalable solution, adaptable to various network scenarios and configurations, establishing a robust basis for information security in UAV-enabled communications.</p></details> | Accepted at IEEE TMC |

Most existing methods feed textual descriptions of the graph structure or neighbouring nodes' text directly into LLMs. However, these approaches often cause LLMs to treat structural information simply as general contextual text, thus limiting their effectiveness in graph-related tasks. In this paper, we introduce LanSAGNN (Language Semantic Anisotropic Graph Neural Network), a framework that extends the concept of anisotropic GNNs to the natural language level. This model leverages LLMs to extract tailor-made semantic information for node pairs, effectively capturing the unique interactions within node relationships. In addition, we propose an efficient dual-layer LLMs finetuning architecture to better align LLMs' outputs with graph tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that LanSAGNN significantly enhances existing LLM-based methods without increasing complexity while also exhibiting strong robustness against interference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICME 2025</p></details> |
| **[HCAF-DTA: drug-target binding affinity prediction with cross-attention fused hypergraph neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02014v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of the binding affinity between drugs and target proteins is a core task in computer-aided drug design. Existing deep learning methods tend to ignore the information of internal sub-structural features of drug molecules and drug-target interactions, resulting in limited prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a drug-target association prediction model HCAF-DTA based on cross-attention fusion hypergraph neural network. The model innovatively introduces hypergraph representation in the feature extraction stage: drug molecule hypergraphs are constructed based on the tree decomposition algorithm, and the sub-structural and global features extracted by fusing the hypergraph neural network with the graphical neural network through hopping connections, in which the hyper edges can efficiently characterise the functional functional groups and other key chemical features; for the protein feature extraction, a weighted graph is constructed based on the residues predicted by the ESM model contact maps to construct weighted graphs, and multilayer graph neural networks were used to capture spatial dependencies. In the prediction stage, a bidirectional multi-head cross-attention mechanism is designed to model intermolecular interactions from the dual viewpoints of atoms and amino acids, and cross-modal features with correlated information are fused by attention. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as Davis and KIBA show that HCAF-DTA outperforms state of the arts in all three performance evaluation metrics, with the MSE metrics reaching 0.198 and 0.122, respectively, with an improvement of up to 4% from the optimal baseline.</p></details> |  |

It leads to a decline in memory, reasoning ability, and behavior, especially in older people. The cause of Alzheimer's Disease is still under exploration and there is no all-inclusive theory that can explain the pathologies in each individual patient. Nevertheless, early intervention has been found to be effective in managing symptoms and slowing down the disease's progression. Recent research has utilized electroencephalography (EEG) data to identify biomarkers that distinguish Alzheimer's Disease patients from healthy individuals. Prior studies have used various machine learning methods, including deep learning and graph neural networks, to examine electroencephalography-based signals for identifying Alzheimer's Disease patients. In our research, we proposed a Flexible and Explainable Gated Graph Convolutional Network (GGCN) with Multi-Objective Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator (MOTPE) hyperparameter tuning. This provides a flexible solution that efficiently identifies the optimal number of GGCN blocks to achieve the optimized precision, specificity, and recall outcomes, as well as the optimized area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC). Our findings demonstrated a high efficacy with an over 0.9 Receiver Operating Characteristic score, alongside precision, specificity, and recall scores in distinguishing health control with Alzheimer's Disease patients in Moderate to Severe Dementia using the power spectrum density (PSD) of electroencephalography signals across various frequency bands. Moreover, our research enhanced the interpretability of the embedded adjacency matrices, revealing connectivity differences in frontal and parietal brain regions between Alzheimer's patients and healthy individuals.</p></details> |  |

Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently emerged as leading models in geometric deep learning, outperforming Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in various graph learning tasks. However, the development of tokenizers for graphs has lagged behind other modalities. To address this, we introduce GQT (\textbf{G}raph \textbf{Q}uantized \textbf{T}okenizer), which decouples tokenizer training from Transformer training by leveraging multi-task graph self-supervised learning, yielding robust and generalizable graph tokens. Furthermore, the GQT utilizes Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) to learn hierarchical discrete tokens, resulting in significantly reduced memory requirements and improved generalization capabilities. By combining the GQT with token modulation, a Transformer encoder achieves state-of-the-art performance on 20 out of 22 benchmarks, including large-scale homophilic and heterophilic datasets.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

However, GNNs may produce biased predictions against certain demographic subgroups due to node attributes and neighbors surrounding a node. Most current research on GNN fairness focuses predominantly on debiasing GNNs using oversimplified fairness evaluation metrics, which can give a misleading impression of fairness. Understanding the potential evaluation paradoxes due to the complicated nature of the graph structure is crucial for developing effective GNN debiasing mechanisms. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of current GNN debiasing methods in terms of unfairness evaluation. Specifically, we introduce a community-level strategy to measure bias in GNNs and evaluate debiasing methods at this level. Further, We introduce ComFairGNN, a novel framework designed to mitigate community-level bias in GNNs. Our approach employs a learnable coreset-based debiasing function that addresses bias arising from diverse local neighborhood distributions during GNNs neighborhood aggregation. Comprehensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate our model's effectiveness in both accuracy and fairness metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at PAKDD 2025</p></details> |

We introduce several training improvements, particularly a novel closest assignment supervision method that dynamically adapts to the model's current state, significantly enhancing performance on problems with larger solution spaces. Our experiments demonstrate the suitability of variable-clause graph representations with recurrent neural network updates, which achieve good accuracy on SAT assignment prediction while reducing computational demands. We extend the base graph neural network into a diffusion model that facilitates incremental sampling and can be effectively combined with classical techniques like unit propagation. Through analysis of embedding space patterns and optimization trajectories, we show how these networks implicitly perform a process very similar to continuous relaxations of MaxSAT, offering an interpretable view of their reasoning process. This understanding guides our design choices and explains the ability of recurrent architectures to scale effectively at inference time beyond their training distribution, which we demonstrate with test-time scaling experiments.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, our method yields a modest speedup of approximately 17% over conventional simulation techniques. These results indicate that the integration of deep learning with traditional physical simulation methods offers a promising pathway to significantly enhance computational efficiency without compromising accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, accepted in conference MAEB 2025 (more info at https://www.uik.eus/es/curso/xvi-congreso-espanol-metaheuristicas-algoritmos-evolutivos-bioinspirados)</p></details> |

Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have shown promise in modeling brain connectivity for AD diagnosis, yet their reliance on linear transformations limits their ability to capture intricate nonlinear patterns in neuroimaging data. To address this, we propose GCN-KAN, a novel single-modal framework that integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) into GCNs to enhance both diagnostic accuracy and interpretability. Leveraging structural MRI data, our model employs learnable spline-based transformations to better represent brain region interactions. Evaluated on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, GCN-KAN outperforms traditional GCNs by 4-8% in classification accuracy while providing interpretable insights into key brain regions associated with AD.

Although graph neural networks have achieved remarkable progress in functional network analysis, challenges such as data scarcity and insufficient supervision persist. To address the limitations of limited training data and inadequate supervision, this paper proposes a novel model named PHGCL-DDGformer that integrates graph contrastive learning with graph transformers, effectively enhancing the representation learning capability for brain network classification tasks. To overcome the constraints of existing graph contrastive learning methods in brain network feature extraction, an adaptive graph augmentation strategy combining attribute masking and edge perturbation is implemented for data enhancement. Subsequently, a dual-domain graph transformer (DDGformer) module is constructed to integrate local and global information, where graph convolutional networks aggregate neighborhood features to capture local patterns while attention mechanisms extract global dependencies. Finally, a graph contrastive learning framework is established to maximize the consistency between positive and negative pairs, thereby obtaining high-quality graph representations. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the PHGCL-DDGformer model outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in brain network classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, uses tikz.sty</p></details> |

Although biomedical research benefits from extensive datasets and established benchmarks, agrochemical data remain scarce, particularly with respect to species-specific toxicity. This work focuses on ApisTox, the most comprehensive dataset of experimentally validated chemical toxicity to the honey bee (Apis mellifera), an ecologically vital pollinator. We evaluate ApisTox using a diverse suite of machine learning approaches, including molecular fingerprints, graph kernels, and graph neural networks, as well as pretrained models. Comparative analysis with medicinal datasets from the MoleculeNet benchmark reveals that ApisTox represents a distinct chemical space. Performance degradation on non-medicinal datasets, such as ApisTox, demonstrates their limited generalizability of current state-of-the-art algorithms trained solely on biomedical data. Our study highlights the need for more diverse datasets and for targeted model development geared toward the agrochemical domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Designing Heterogeneous GNNs with Desired Permutation Properties for Wireless Resource Allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03906v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been designed for learning a variety of wireless policies, i.e., the mappings from environment parameters to decision variables, thanks to their superior performance, and the potential in enabling scalability and size generalizability. These merits are rooted in leveraging permutation prior, i.e., satisfying the permutation property of the policy to be learned (referred to as desired permutation property). Many wireless policies are with complicated permutation properties. To satisfy these properties, heterogeneous GNNs (HetGNNs) should be used to learn such policies. There are two critical factors that enable a HetGNN to satisfy a desired permutation property: constructing an appropriate heterogeneous graph and judiciously designing the architecture of the HetGNN. However, both the graph and the HetGNN are designed heuristically so far. In this paper, we strive to provide a systematic approach for the design to satisfy the desired permutation property. We first propose a method for constructing a graph for a policy, where the edges and their types are defined for the sake of satisfying complicated permutation properties. Then, we provide and prove three sufficient conditions to design a HetGNN such that it can satisfy the desired permutation property when learning over an appropriate graph. These conditions suggest a method of designing the HetGNN with desired permutation property by sharing the processing, combining, and pooling functions according to the types of vertices and edges of the graph. We take power allocation and hybrid precoding policies as examples for demonstrating how to apply the proposed methods and validating the impact of the permutation prior by simulations.</p></details> |  |

Graphs from real-world datasets often evolve over time, with newly emerging edges and dynamically changing node properties, posing a significant challenge for this problem. In response, temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) have been developed to predict dynamic node properties from a stream of emerging edges. However, our analysis reveals that most TGNN-based methods are (a) far less effective without proper node features and, due to their complex model architectures, (b) vulnerable to distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose SPLASH, a simple yet powerful method for predicting node properties on edge streams under distribution shifts. Our key contributions are as follows: (1) we propose feature augmentation methods and an automatic feature selection method for edge streams, which improve the effectiveness of TGNNs, (2) we propose a lightweight MLP-based TGNN architecture that is highly efficient and robust under distribution shifts, and (3) we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the accuracy, efficiency, generalization, and qualitative performance of the proposed method and its competitors on dynamic node classification, dynamic anomaly detection, and node affinity prediction tasks across seven real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures, To Appear in ICDE 2025</p></details> |

Existing GNNs primarily operate in Euclidean spaces, which can limit their ability to capture hierarchical and multi-relational structures inherent to complex graphs. LGIN addresses this by incorporating curvature-aware aggregation functions that preserve the Lorentzian metric tensor, ensuring embeddings remain constrained within the hyperbolic space by proposing a new update rule that effectively captures both local neighborhood interactions and global structural properties, enabling LGIN to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs with expressiveness at least as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Through extensive evaluation across nine benchmark datasets, including molecular and protein structures, LGIN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art GNNs, demonstrating its robustness and efficacy in modeling complex graph structures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to extend the concept of a powerful graph neural network to Riemannian manifolds, paving the way for future advancements in hyperbolic graph learning.

Therefore, they need to constantly monitor vast amounts of incoming and outgoing transactions. A particular challenge in detecting money laundering is that money launderers continuously adapt their tactics to evade detection. Hence, detection methods need constant fine-tuning. Traditional machine learning models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuning the model on new data, thereby limiting their effectiveness in dynamic environments. Continual learning methods may address this issue and enhance current anti-money laundering (AML) practices, by allowing models to incorporate new information while retaining prior knowledge. Research on continual graph learning for AML, however, is still scarce. In this review, we critically evaluate state-of-the-art continual graph learning approaches for AML applications. We categorise methods into replay-based, regularization-based, and architecture-based strategies within the graph neural network (GNN) framework, and we provide in-depth experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world AML data sets that showcase the effect of the different hyperparameters. Our analysis demonstrates that continual learning improves model adaptability and robustness in the face of extreme class imbalances and evolving fraud patterns. Finally, we outline key challenges and propose directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

To address the scalability issue of traditional TE algorithms, learning-based approaches have been proposed, showing potential of significant efficiency improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Nevertheless, the intrinsic limitations of existing learning-based methods hinder their practical application: they are not generalizable across diverse topologies and network conditions, incur excessive training overhead, and do not respect link capacities by default. This paper proposes TELGEN, a novel TE algorithm that learns to solve TE problems efficiently in large-scale networks, while achieving superior generalizability across diverse network conditions. TELGEN is based on the novel idea of transforming the problem of "predicting the optimal TE solution" into "predicting the optimal TE algorithm", which enables TELGEN to learn and efficiently approximate the end-to-end solving process of classical optimal TE algorithms. The learned algorithm is agnostic to the exact network topology or traffic patterns, and can efficiently solve TE problems given arbitrary inputs and generalize well to unseen topologies and demands. We trained and evaluated TELGEN on random and real-world networks with up to 5000 nodes and 106 links. TELGEN achieved less than 3% optimality gap while ensuring feasibility in all cases, even when the test network had up to 20x more nodes than the largest in training. It also saved up to 84% solving time than classical optimal solver, and could reduce training time per epoch and solving time by 2-4 orders of magnitude than latest learning algorithms on the largest networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Backdoor Graph Condensation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11025v4)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph condensation has recently emerged as a prevalent technique to improve the training efficiency for graph neural networks (GNNs). It condenses a large graph into a small one such that a GNN trained on this small synthetic graph can achieve comparable performance to a GNN trained on the large graph. However, while existing graph condensation studies mainly focus on the best trade-off between graph size and the GNNs' performance (model utility), they overlook the security issues of graph condensation. To bridge this gap, we first explore backdoor attack against the GNNs trained on the condensed graphs. We introduce an effective backdoor attack against graph condensation, termed BGC. This attack aims to (1) preserve the condensed graph quality despite trigger injection, and (2) ensure trigger efficacy through the condensation process, achieving a high attack success rate. Specifically, BGC consistently updates triggers during condensation and targets representative nodes for poisoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack. BGC achieves a high attack success rate (close to 1.0) and good model utility in all cases. Furthermore, the results against multiple defense methods demonstrate BGC's resilience under their defenses. Finally, we analyze the key hyperparameters that influence the attack performance. Our code is available at: https://github.com/JiahaoWuGit/BGC.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICDE ...</summary><p>ICDE 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> |

The latter consists of spray-based printing of cementitious plaster on a wall and is facilitated with the use of a robotic arm. The predictions are computed using the robotic arm trajectory features, such as position, velocity and direction, as well as the printing process parameters. The proposed approach, based on a particle representation of the wall domain and the end effector, allows for the adoption of a graph-based solution. The GNN model consists of an encoder-processor-decoder architecture and is trained using data from laboratory tests, while the hyperparameters are optimized by means of a Bayesian scheme. The aim of this model is to act as a simulator of the printing process, and ultimately used for the generation of the robotic arm trajectory and the optimization of the printing parameters, towards the materialization of an autonomous plastering process. The performance of the proposed model is assessed in terms of the prediction error against unseen ground truth data, which shows its generality in varied scenarios, as well as in comparison with the performance of an existing benchmark model. The results demonstrate a significant improvement over the benchmark model, with notably better performance and enhanced error scaling across prediction steps.</p></details> |  |

While classical Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are renowned for their scalability and robustness, existing QGNNs often lack flexibility due to graph-specific quantum circuit designs, limiting their applicability to a narrower range of graph-structured problems, falling short of real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a versatile QGNN framework inspired by the classical GraphSAGE approach, utilizing quantum models as aggregators. In this work, we integrate established techniques for inductive representation learning on graphs with parametrized quantum convolutional and pooling layers, effectively bridging classical and quantum paradigms. The convolutional layer is flexible, enabling tailored designs for specific problems. Benchmarked on a node regression task with the QM9 dataset, we demonstrate that our framework successfully models a non-trivial molecular dataset, achieving performance comparable to classical GNNs. In particular, we show that our quantum approach exhibits robust generalization across molecules with varying numbers of atoms without requiring circuit modifications, slightly outperforming classical GNNs. Furthermore, we numerically investigate the scalability of the QGNN framework. Specifically, we demonstrate the absence of barren plateaus in our architecture as the number of qubits increases, suggesting that the proposed quantum model can be extended to handle larger and more complex graph-based problems effectively.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

However, optimizing donor-acceptor (D-A) combinations to achieve high power conversion efficiency (PCE) remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a framework that integrates large-scale pretraining of graph neural networks (GNNs) with a GPT-2 (Generative Pretrained Transformer 2)-based reinforcement learning (RL) strategy to design OPV molecules with potentially high PCE. This approach produces candidate molecules with predicted efficiencies approaching 21\%, although further experimental validation is required. Moreover, we conducted a preliminary fragment-level analysis to identify structural motifs recognized by the RL model that may contribute to enhanced PCE, thus providing design guidelines for the broader research community. To facilitate continued discovery, we are building the largest open-source OPV dataset to date, expected to include nearly 3,000 donor-acceptor pairs.

Traditional influence maximization strategies often fail to keep up with rapidly evolving relationships and structures, leading to missed opportunities and inefficiencies. To address this, we propose a novel learning-based approach integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) models. This hybrid framework captures both structural and temporal dynamics, enabling accurate prediction of candidate nodes for seed set selection. The bidirectional nature of BiLSTM allows our model to analyze patterns from both past and future network states, ensuring adaptability to changes over time. By dynamically adapting to graph evolution at each time snapshot, our approach improves seed set calculation efficiency, achieving an average of 90% accuracy in predicting potential seed nodes across diverse networks. This significantly reduces computational overhead by optimizing the number of nodes evaluated for seed selection. Our method is particularly effective in fields like viral marketing and social network analysis, where understanding temporal dynamics is crucial.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, Accepted in AAAI25 to AI4TS Workshop@AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Addressing the OOD generalization gap is crucial when models are deployed in environments significantly different from the training set, such as applying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) trained on small graphs to large, real-world graphs. One promising approach for achieving robust OOD generalization is the framework of neural algorithmic alignment, which incorporates ideas from classical algorithms by designing neural architectures that resemble specific algorithmic paradigms (e.g. dynamic programming). The hope is that trained models of this form would have superior OOD capabilities, in much the same way that classical algorithms work for all instances. We rigorously analyze the role of algorithmic alignment in achieving OOD generalization, focusing on graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to the canonical shortest path problem. We prove that GNNs, trained to minimize a sparsity-regularized loss over a small set of shortest path instances, exactly implement the Bellman-Ford (BF) algorithm for shortest paths. In fact, if a GNN minimizes this loss within an error of $\epsilon$, it implements the BF algorithm with an error of $O(\epsilon)$. Consequently, despite limited training data, these GNNs are guaranteed to extrapolate to arbitrary shortest-path problems, including instances of any size. Our empirical results support our theory by showing that NNs trained by gradient descent are able to minimize this loss and extrapolate in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical graph sampling based minibatch learning with chain preservation and variance reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00860v5)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph sampling based Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) decouple the sampling from the forward and backward propagation during minibatch training, which exhibit good scalability in terms of layer depth and graph size. We propose HIS_GCNs, a hierarchical importance graph sampling based learning method. By constructing minibatches using sampled subgraphs, HIS_GCNs gives attention to the importance of both core and periphery nodes/edges in a scale-free training graph. Specifically, it preserves the centrum of the core to most minibatches, which maintains connectivity between periphery nodes, and samples periphery edges without core node interference, in order to keep more long chains composed entirely of low-degree nodes in the same minibatch. HIS_GCNs can maximize the discrete Ricci curvature (i.e., Ollivier-Ricci curvatures) of the edges in a subgraph that enables the preservation of important chains for information propagation, and can achieve a low node embedding variance and a high convergence speed. Diverse experiments on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with node classification tasks confirm superior performance of HIS_GCNs in both accuracy and training time.

| **[Simple Feedfoward Neural Networks are Almost All You Need for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23621v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data are everywhere -- from finance to healthcare -- and each domain brings its own unique complexities and structures. While advanced models like Transformers and graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained popularity in time series forecasting, largely due to their success in tasks like language modeling, their added complexity is not always necessary. In our work, we show that simple feedforward neural networks (SFNNs) can achieve performance on par with, or even exceeding, these state-of-the-art models, while being simpler, smaller, faster, and more robust. Our analysis indicates that, in many cases, univariate SFNNs are sufficient, implying that modeling interactions between multiple series may offer only marginal benefits. Even when inter-series relationships are strong, a basic multivariate SFNN still delivers competitive results. We also examine some key design choices and offer guidelines on making informed decisions. Additionally, we critique existing benchmarking practices and propose an improved evaluation protocol. Although SFNNs may not be optimal for every situation (hence the ``almost'' in our title) they serve as a strong baseline that future time series forecasting methods should always be compared against.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-Eq: Discovering Mathematical Equations using Graph Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23617v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to discover meaningful, accurate, and concise mathematical equations that describe datasets is valuable across various domains. Equations offer explicit relationships between variables, enabling deeper insights into underlying data patterns. Most existing equation discovery methods rely on genetic programming, which iteratively searches the equation space but is often slow and prone to overfitting. By representing equations as directed acyclic graphs, we leverage the use of graph neural networks to learn the underlying semantics of equations, and generate new, previously unseen equations. Although graph generative models have been shown to be successful in discovering new types of graphs in many fields, there application in discovering equations remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose Graph-EQ, a deep graph generative model designed for efficient equation discovery. Graph-EQ uses a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to learn a rich latent representation of the equation space by training it on a large corpus of equations in an unsupervised manner. Instead of directly searching the equation space, we employ Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore this learned latent space. We show that the encoder-decoder architecture of Graph-Eq is able to accurately reconstruct input equations. Moreover, we show that the learned latent representation can be sampled and decoded into valid equations, including new and previously unseen equations in the training data. Finally, we assess Graph-Eq's ability to discover equations that best fit a dataset by exploring the latent space using Bayesian optimization. Latent space exploration is done on 20 dataset with known ground-truth equations, and Graph-Eq is shown to successfully discover the grountruth equation in the majority of datasets.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Krait: A Backdoor Attack Against Graph Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13068v2)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph prompt tuning has emerged as a promising paradigm to effectively transfer general graph knowledge from pre-trained models to various downstream tasks, particularly in few-shot contexts. However, its susceptibility to backdoor attacks, where adversaries insert triggers to manipulate outcomes, raises a critical concern. We conduct the first study to investigate such vulnerability, revealing that backdoors can disguise benign graph prompts, thus evading detection. We introduce Krait, a novel graph prompt backdoor. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective model-agnostic metric called label non-uniformity homophily to select poisoned candidates, significantly reducing computational complexity. To accommodate diverse attack scenarios and advanced attack types, we design three customizable trigger generation methods to craft prompts as triggers. We propose a novel centroid similarity-based loss function to optimize prompt tuning for attack effectiveness and stealthiness. Experiments on four real-world graphs demonstrate that Krait can efficiently embed triggers to merely 0.15% to 2% of training nodes, achieving high attack success rates without sacrificing clean accuracy. Notably, in one-to-one and all-to-one attacks, Krait can achieve 100% attack success rates by poisoning as few as 2 and 22 nodes, respectively. Our experiments further show that Krait remains potent across different transfer cases, attack types, and graph neural network backbones. Additionally, Krait can be successfully extended to the black-box setting, posing more severe threats. Finally, we analyze why Krait can evade both classical and state-of-the-art defenses, and provide practical insights for detecting and mitigating this class of attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SaTML'2025</p></details> |
| **[Question-Aware Knowledge Graph Prompting for Enhancing Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23523v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with tasks requiring external knowledge, such as knowledge-intensive Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA). Integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can enhance reasoning; however, existing methods typically demand costly fine-tuning or retrieve noisy KG information. Recent approaches leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generate KG-based input embedding prefixes as soft prompts for LLMs but fail to account for question relevance, resulting in noisy prompts. Moreover, in MCQA tasks, the absence of relevant KG knowledge for certain answer options remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose Question-Aware Knowledge Graph Prompting (QAP), which incorporates question embeddings into GNN aggregation to dynamically assess KG relevance. QAP employs global attention to capture inter-option relationships, enriching soft prompts with inferred knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that QAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, highlighting its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[POINT$^{2}$: A Polymer Informatics Training and Testing Database](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23491v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of polymer informatics has been significantly propelled by the integration of machine learning (ML) techniques, enabling the rapid prediction of polymer properties and expediting the discovery of high-performance polymeric materials. However, the field lacks a standardized workflow that encompasses prediction accuracy, uncertainty quantification, ML interpretability, and polymer synthesizability. In this study, we introduce POINT$^{2}$ (POlymer INformatics Training and Testing), a comprehensive benchmark database and protocol designed to address these critical challenges. Leveraging the existing labeled datasets and the unlabeled PI1M dataset, a collection of approximately one million virtual polymers generated via a recurrent neural network trained on the realistic polymers, we develop an ensemble of ML models, including Quantile Random Forests, Multilayer Perceptrons with dropout, Graph Neural Networks, and pretrained large language models. These models are coupled with diverse polymer representations such as Morgan, MACCS, RDKit, Topological, Atom Pair fingerprints, and graph-based descriptors to achieve property predictions, uncertainty estimations, model interpretability, and template-based polymerization synthesizability across a spectrum of properties, including gas permeability, thermal conductivity, glass transition temperature, melting temperature, fractional free volume, and density. The POINT$^{2}$ database can serve as a valuable resource for the polymer informatics community for polymer discovery and optimization.</p></details> |  |

| **[TouchUp-G: Improving Feature Representation through Graph-Centric Finetuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13885v2)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can we enhance the node features acquired from Pretrained Models (PMs) to better suit downstream graph learning tasks? Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the state-of-the-art approach for many high-impact, real-world graph applications. For feature-rich graphs, a prevalent practice involves utilizing a PM directly to generate features, without incorporating any domain adaptation techniques. Nevertheless, this practice is suboptimal because the node features extracted from PM are graph-agnostic and prevent GNNs from fully utilizing the potential correlations between the graph structure and node features, leading to a decline in GNNs performance. In this work, we seek to improve the node features obtained from a PM for downstream graph tasks and introduce TOUCHUP-G, which has several advantages. It is (a) General: applicable to any downstream graph task, including link prediction which is often employed in recommender systems; (b) Multi-modal: able to improve raw features of any modality (e.g. images, texts, audio); (c) Principled: it is closely related to a novel metric, feature homophily, which we propose to quantify the potential correlations between the graph structure and node features and we show that TOUCHUP-G can effectively shrink the discrepancy between the graph structure and node features; (d) Effective: achieving state-of-the-art results on four real-world datasets spanning different tasks and modalities.</p></details> | SIGIR 2024 |
| **[A QUBO Framework for Team Formation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23209v1)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The team formation problem assumes a set of experts and a task, where each expert has a set of skills and the task requires some skills. The objective is to find a set of experts that maximizes coverage of the required skills while simultaneously minimizing the costs associated with the experts. Different definitions of cost have traditionally led to distinct problem formulations and algorithmic solutions. We introduce the unified TeamFormation formulation that captures all cost definitions for team formation problems that balance task coverage and expert cost. Specifically, we formulate three TeamFormation variants with different cost functions using quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and we evaluate two distinct general-purpose solution methods. We show that solutions based on the QUBO formulations of TeamFormation problems are at least as good as those produced by established baselines. Furthermore, we show that QUBO-based solutions leveraging graph neural networks can effectively learn representations of experts and skills to enable transfer learning, allowing node embeddings from one problem instance to be efficiently applied to another.</p></details> |  |
