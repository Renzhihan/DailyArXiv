| **[Deconfounding Multi-Cause Latent Confounders: A Factor-Model Approach to Climate Model Bias Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12063v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global Climate Models (GCMs) are crucial for predicting future climate changes by simulating the Earth systems. However, the GCM Outputs exhibit systematic biases due to model uncertainties, parameterization simplifications, and inadequate representation of complex climate phenomena. Traditional bias correction methods, which rely on historical observation data and statistical techniques, often neglect unobserved confounders, leading to biased results. This paper proposes a novel bias correction approach to utilize both GCM and observational data to learn a factor model that captures multi-cause latent confounders. Inspired by recent advances in causality based time series deconfounding, our method first constructs a factor model to learn latent confounders from historical data and then applies them to enhance the bias correction process using advanced time series forecasting models. The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in the accuracy of precipitation outputs. By addressing unobserved confounders, our approach offers a robust and theoretically grounded solution for climate model bias correction.</p></details> | IJCAI 2025 Accepted |
| **[A Novel Large-scale Crop Dataset and Dual-stream Transformer Method for Fine-grained Hierarchical Crop Classification from Integrated Hyperspectral EnMAP Data and Multispectral Sentinel-2 Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06155v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained crop classification is crucial for precision agriculture and food security monitoring. It requires simultaneous capture of both phenological dynamics (obtained from multi-temporal satellite data like Sentinel-2) and subtle spectral variations (demanding nanometer-scale spectral resolution from hyperspectral imagery). Research combining these two modalities remains scarce currently due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and crop types annotation costs. To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical hyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP hyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series. With over one million annotated field parcels organized in a four-tier crop taxonomy, H2Crop establishes a vital benchmark for fine-grained agricultural crop classification and hyperspectral image processing. We propose a dual-stream Transformer architecture that synergistically processes these modalities. It coordinates two specialized pathways: a spectral-spatial Transformer extracts fine-grained signatures from hyperspectral EnMAP data, while a temporal Swin Transformer extracts crop growth patterns from Sentinel-2 time series. The designed hierarchy classification heads with hierarchical fusion then simultaneously delivers multi-level classification across all taxonomic tiers. Experiments demonstrate that adding hyperspectral EnMAP data to Sentinel-2 time series yields a 4.2% average F1-scores improvement (peaking at 6.3%). Extensive comparisons also confirming our method's higher accuracy over existing deep learning approaches for crop type classification and the consistent benefits of hyperspectral data across varying temporal windows and crop change scenarios. Codes and dataset will be available at https://github.com/flyakon/H2Crop and www.glass.hku.hk Keywords: Crop type classification, precision agriculture, remote sensing, deep learning, hyperspectral data, Sentinel-2 time series, fine-grained crops</p></details> | 28 pages, 12 figures |
| **[VisionTS: Visual Masked Autoencoders Are Free-Lunch Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17253v4)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have emerged as a promising approach in time series forecasting (TSF). Existing approaches either repurpose large language models (LLMs) or build large-scale time series datasets to develop TSF foundation models for universal forecasting. However, these methods face challenges due to the severe cross-domain gap or in-domain heterogeneity. This paper explores a new road to building a TSF foundation model from rich, high-quality natural images. Our key insight is that a visual masked autoencoder, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, can naturally be a numeric series forecaster. By reformulating TSF as an image reconstruction task, we bridge the gap between image pre-training and TSF downstream tasks. Surprisingly, without further adaptation in the time series domain, the proposed VisionTS could achieve better zero-shot forecast performance than existing TSF foundation models. With fine-tuning for one epoch, VisionTS could further improve the forecasting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in most cases. Extensive experiments reveal intrinsic similarities between images and real-world time series, suggesting that visual models may offer a "free lunch" for TSF and highlight the potential for future cross-modality research. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Keytoyze/VisionTS.</p></details> | <details><summary>v4: a...</summary><p>v4: accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Marchenko-Pastur laws for Daniell smoothed periodograms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14618v5)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a sample $X_0,...,X_{n-1}$ from a $d$-dimensional stationary time series $(X_t)_{t \in \mathbb{Z}}$, the most commonly used estimator for the spectral density matrix $F(\theta)$ at a given frequency $\theta \in [0,2\pi)$ is the Daniell smoothed periodogram $$S(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m+1} \sum\limits_{j=-m}^m I\Big( \theta + \frac{2\pi j}{n} \Big) \ ,$$ which is an average over $2m+1$ many periodograms at slightly perturbed frequencies. We prove that the Marchenko-Pastur law holds for the eigenvalues of $S(\theta)$ uniformly in $\theta \in [0,2\pi)$, when $d$ and $m$ grow with $n$ such that $\frac{d}{m} \rightarrow c>0$ and $d\asymp n^{\alpha}$ for some $\alpha \in (0,1)$. This demonstrates that high-dimensional effects can cause $S(\theta)$ to become inconsistent, even when the dimension $d$ is much smaller than the sample size $n$. Notably, we do not assume independence of the $d$ components of the time series. The Marchenko-Pastur law thus holds for Daniell smoothed periodograms, even when it does not necessarily hold for sample auto-covariance matrices of the same processes.</p></details> | 53 pages |
| **[SDE Matching: Scalable and Simulation-Free Training of Latent Stochastic Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02472v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Latent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) is a powerful tool for time series and sequence modeling. However, training Latent SDEs typically relies on adjoint sensitivity methods, which depend on simulation and backpropagation through approximate SDE solutions, which limit scalability. In this work, we propose SDE Matching, a new simulation-free method for training Latent SDEs. Inspired by modern Score- and Flow Matching algorithms for learning generative dynamics, we extend these ideas to the domain of stochastic dynamics for time series and sequence modeling, eliminating the need for costly numerical simulations. Our results demonstrate that SDE Matching achieves performance comparable to adjoint sensitivity methods while drastically reducing computational complexity.</p></details> |  |

This study investigates the temporal and spatial similarities in their service demands to assess potential for routine cross-agency collaboration. Time series analysis revealed aligned demand peaks in summer, on Fridays, during daytime hours, and were highly sensitive to high temperature weather conditions. Bivariate mapping and Moran I indicated significant spatial overlaps in central London and Hillingdon. Geographically Weighted Regression, GWR, examined the influence of socioeconomic factors, while Comap analysis uncovered spatiotemporal heterogeneity across fire service types. The findings highlight opportunities for targeted collaboration in high-overlap areas and peak periods, offering practical insights to enhance emergency service resilience and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[LightGTS: A Lightweight General Time Series Forecasting Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06005v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing works on general time series forecasting build foundation models with heavy model parameters through large-scale multi-source pre-training. These models achieve superior generalization ability across various datasets at the cost of significant computational burdens and limitations in resource-constrained scenarios. This paper introduces LightGTS, a lightweight general time series forecasting model designed from the perspective of consistent periodical modeling. To handle diverse scales and intrinsic periods in multi-source pre-training, we introduce Periodical Tokenization, which extracts consistent periodic patterns across different datasets with varying scales. To better utilize the periodicity in the decoding process, we further introduce Periodical Parallel Decoding, which leverages historical tokens to improve forecasting. Based on the two techniques above which fully leverage the inductive bias of periods inherent in time series, LightGTS uses a lightweight model to achieve outstanding performance on general time series forecasting. It achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance on 9 real-world benchmarks in both zero-shot and full-shot settings with much better efficiency compared with existing time series foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 42th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Graph Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15978v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph deep learning methods have become popular tools to process collections of correlated time series. Unlike traditional multivariate forecasting methods, graph-based predictors leverage pairwise relationships by conditioning forecasts on graphs spanning the time series collection. The conditioning takes the form of architectural inductive biases on the forecasting architecture, resulting in a family of models called spatiotemporal graph neural networks. These biases allow for training global forecasting models on large collections of time series while localizing predictions w.r.t. each element in the set (nodes) by accounting for correlations among them (edges). Recent advances in graph neural networks and deep learning for time series forecasting make the adoption of such processing framework appealing and timely. However, most studies focus on refining existing architectures by exploiting modern deep-learning practices. Conversely, foundational and methodological aspects have not been subject to systematic investigation. To fill this void, this tutorial paper aims to introduce a comprehensive methodological framework formalizing the forecasting problem and providing design principles for graph-based predictors, as well as methods to assess their performance. In addition, together with an overview of the field, we provide design guidelines and best practices, as well as an in-depth discussion of open challenges and future directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a tutorial paper in ACM Computing Surveys</p></details> |
| **[Yule-Walker Estimation for Functional Time Series in Hilbert Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05922v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in data collection technologies have led to the widespread availability of functional data observed over time, often exhibiting strong temporal dependence. However, existing methodologies typically assume independence across functions or impose restrictive low-order dependence structures, limiting their ability to capture the full dynamics of functional time series. To address this gap, we investigate higher-order functional autoregressive (FAR) models in Hilbert spaces, focusing on the statistical challenges introduced by infinite dimensionality. A fundamental challenge arises from the ill-posedness of estimating autoregressive operators, which stems from the compactness of the autocovariance operator and the consequent unboundedness of its inverse. We propose a regularized Yule-Walker-type estimation procedure, grounded in Tikhonov regularization, to stabilize the estimation. Specializing to $L^2$ spaces, we derive explicit and computationally feasible estimators that parallel classical finite-dimensional methods. Within a unified theoretical framework, we study the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and predictors. Notably, while the regularized predictors attain asymptotic normality, the corresponding estimators of the autoregressive operators fail to converge weakly in distribution under the operator norm topology, due to the compactness of the autocovariance operator. We further analyze the mean squared prediction error (MSPE), decomposing it into components attributable to regularization bias, truncation, and estimation variance. This decomposition reveals the advantages of our approach over traditional linear truncation schemes. Extensive simulations and an application to high-frequency wearable sensor data demonstrate the practical utility and robustness of the proposed methodology in capturing complex temporal structures in functional time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeviceScope: An Interactive App to Detect and Localize Appliance Patterns in Electricity Consumption Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05912v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, electricity suppliers have installed millions of smart meters worldwide to improve the management of the smart grid system. These meters collect a large amount of electrical consumption data to produce valuable information to help consumers reduce their electricity footprint. However, having non-expert users (e.g., consumers or sales advisors) understand these data and derive usage patterns for different appliances has become a significant challenge for electricity suppliers because these data record the aggregated behavior of all appliances. At the same time, ground-truth labels (which could train appliance detection and localization models) are expensive to collect and extremely scarce in practice. This paper introduces DeviceScope, an interactive tool designed to facilitate understanding smart meter data by detecting and localizing individual appliance patterns within a given time period. Our system is based on CamAL (Class Activation Map-based Appliance Localization), a novel weakly supervised approach for appliance localization that only requires the knowledge of the existence of an appliance in a household to be trained.

| **[Infinite-Dimensional Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10130v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have had a profound impact on many application areas, including those where data are intrinsically infinite-dimensional, such as images or time series. The standard approach is first to discretize and then to apply diffusion models to the discretized data. While such approaches are practically appealing, the performance of the resulting algorithms typically deteriorates as discretization parameters are refined. In this paper, we instead directly formulate diffusion-based generative models in infinite dimensions and apply them to the generative modelling of functions. We prove that our formulations are well posed in the infinite-dimensional setting and provide dimension-independent distance bounds from the sample to the target measure. Using our theory, we also develop guidelines for the design of infinite-dimensional diffusion models. For image distributions, these guidelines are in line with current canonical choices. For other distributions, however, we can improve upon these canonical choices. We demonstrate these results both theoretically and empirically, by applying the algorithms to data distributions on manifolds and to distributions arising in Bayesian inverse problems or simulation-based inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wavelet-based Disentangled Adaptive Normalization for Non-stationary Times Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05857v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting non-stationary time series is a challenging task because their statistical properties often change over time, making it hard for deep models to generalize well. Instance-level normalization techniques can help address shifts in temporal distribution. However, most existing methods overlook the multi-component nature of time series, where different components exhibit distinct non-stationary behaviors. In this paper, we propose Wavelet-based Disentangled Adaptive Normalization (WDAN), a model-agnostic framework designed to address non-stationarity in time series forecasting. WDAN uses discrete wavelet transforms to break down the input into low-frequency trends and high-frequency fluctuations. It then applies tailored normalization strategies to each part. For trend components that exhibit strong non-stationarity, we apply first-order differencing to extract stable features used for predicting normalization parameters. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that WDAN consistently improves forecasting accuracy across various backbone model. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/MonBG/WDAN.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Reliable Framework for Human-in-the-Loop Anomaly Detection in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03234v3)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection is a critical machine learning task for numerous applications, such as finance, healthcare, and industrial systems. However, even high-performing models may exhibit potential issues such as biases, leading to unreliable outcomes and misplaced confidence. While model explanation techniques, particularly visual explanations, offer valuable insights by elucidating model attributions of their decision, many limitations still exist -- They are primarily instance-based and not scalable across the dataset, and they provide one-directional information from the model to the human side, lacking a mechanism for users to address detected issues. To fulfill these gaps, we introduce HILAD, a novel framework designed to foster a dynamic and bidirectional collaboration between humans and AI for enhancing anomaly detection models in time series. Through our visual interface, HILAD empowers domain experts to detect, interpret, and correct unexpected model behaviors at scale. Our evaluation through user studies with two models and three time series datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of HILAD, which fosters a deeper model understanding, immediate corrective actions, and model reliability enhancement.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript is currently under review</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Representations and Interventions in Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12915v5)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models (TSFMs) promise to be powerful tools for a wide range of applications. However, their internal representations and learned concepts are still not well understood. In this study, we investigate the structure and redundancy of representations across various TSFMs, examining the self-similarity of model layers within and across different model sizes. This analysis reveals block-like redundancy in the representations, which can be utilized for informed pruning to improve inference speed and efficiency. Additionally, we explore the concepts learned by these models - such as periodicity and trends - and how these can be manipulated through latent space steering to influence model behavior. Our experiments show that steering interventions can introduce new features, e.g., adding periodicity or trends to signals that initially lacked them. These findings underscore the value of representational analysis for optimizing models and demonstrate how conceptual steering offers new possibilities for more controlled and efficient time series analysis with TSFMs.</p></details> | Accepted at ICML'25 |
| **[FaCTR: Factorized Channel-Temporal Representation Transformers for Efficient Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05597v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Transformers excel in language and vision-where inputs are semantically rich and exhibit univariate dependency structures-their architectural complexity leads to diminishing returns in time series forecasting. Time series data is characterized by low per-timestep information density and complex dependencies across channels and covariates, requiring conditioning on structured variable interactions. To address this mismatch and overparameterization, we propose FaCTR, a lightweight spatiotemporal Transformer with an explicitly structural design. FaCTR injects dynamic, symmetric cross-channel interactions-modeled via a low-rank Factorization Machine into temporally contextualized patch embeddings through a learnable gating mechanism. It further encodes static and dynamic covariates for multivariate conditioning. Despite its compact design, FaCTR achieves state-of-the-art performance on eleven public forecasting benchmarks spanning both short-term and long-term horizons, with its largest variant using close to only 400K parameters-on average 50x smaller than competitive spatiotemporal transformer baselines. In addition, its structured design enables interpretability through cross-channel influence scores-an essential requirement for real-world decision-making. Finally, FaCTR supports self-supervised pretraining, positioning it as a compact yet versatile foundation for downstream time series tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relational Conformal Prediction for Correlated Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09443v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of uncertainty quantification in time series forecasting by exploiting observations at correlated sequences. Relational deep learning methods leveraging graph representations are among the most effective tools for obtaining point estimates from spatiotemporal data and correlated time series. However, the problem of exploiting relational structures to estimate the uncertainty of such predictions has been largely overlooked in the same context. To this end, we propose a novel distribution-free approach based on the conformal prediction framework and quantile regression. Despite the recent applications of conformal prediction to sequential data, existing methods operate independently on each target time series and do not account for relationships among them when constructing the prediction interval. We fill this void by introducing a novel conformal prediction method based on graph deep learning operators. Our approach, named Conformal Relational Prediction (CoRel), does not require the relational structure (graph) to be known a priori and can be applied on top of any pre-trained predictor. Additionally, CoRel includes an adaptive component to handle non-exchangeable data and changes in the input time series. Our approach provides accurate coverage and achieves state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification in relevant benchmarks.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Online Conformal Model Selection for Nonstationary Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05544v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the MPS (Model Prediction Set), a novel framework for online model selection for nonstationary time series. Classical model selection methods, such as information criteria and cross-validation, rely heavily on the stationarity assumption and often fail in dynamic environments which undergo gradual or abrupt changes over time. Yet real-world data are rarely stationary, and model selection under nonstationarity remains a largely open problem. To tackle this challenge, we combine conformal inference with model confidence sets to develop a procedure that adaptively selects models best suited to the evolving dynamics at any given time. Concretely, the MPS updates in real time a confidence set of candidate models that covers the best model for the next time period with a specified long-run probability, while adapting to nonstationarity of unknown forms. Through simulations and real-world data analysis, we demonstrate that MPS reliably and efficiently identifies optimal models under nonstationarity, an essential capability lacking in offline methods. Moreover, MPS frequently produces high-quality sets with small cardinality, whose evolution offers deeper insights into changing dynamics. As a generic framework, MPS accommodates any data-generating process, data structure, model class, training method, and evaluation metric, making it broadly applicable across diverse problem settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Winner-takes-all for Multivariate Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05515v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce TimeMCL, a method leveraging the Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) paradigm to forecast multiple plausible time series futures. Our approach employs a neural network with multiple heads and utilizes the Winner-Takes-All (WTA) loss to promote diversity among predictions. MCL has recently gained attention due to its simplicity and ability to address ill-posed and ambiguous tasks. We propose an adaptation of this framework for time-series forecasting, presenting it as an efficient method to predict diverse futures, which we relate to its implicit quantization objective. We provide insights into our approach using synthetic data and evaluate it on real-world time series, demonstrating its promising performance at a light computational cost.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[The broader spectrum of in-context learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03782v3)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of language models to learn a task from a few examples in context has generated substantial interest. Here, we provide a perspective that situates this type of supervised few-shot learning within a much broader spectrum of meta-learned in-context learning. Indeed, we suggest that any distribution of sequences in which context non-trivially decreases loss on subsequent predictions can be interpreted as eliciting a kind of in-context learning. We suggest that this perspective helps to unify the broad set of in-context abilities that language models exhibit -- such as adapting to tasks from instructions or role play, or extrapolating time series. This perspective also sheds light on potential roots of in-context learning in lower-level processing of linguistic dependencies (e.g. coreference or parallel structures). Finally, taking this perspective highlights the importance of generalization, which we suggest can be studied along several dimensions: not only the ability to learn something novel, but also flexibility in learning from different presentations, and in applying what is learned. We discuss broader connections to past literature in meta-learning and goal-conditioned agents, and other perspectives on learning and adaptation. We close by suggesting that research on in-context learning should consider this broader spectrum of in-context capabilities and types of generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Beyond Experience: Generalizing to Unseen State Space with Reservoir Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05292v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning techniques offer an effective approach to modeling dynamical systems solely from observed data. However, without explicit structural priors -- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing -- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system behavior in entirely unobserved basins.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |
| **[How to Unlock Time Series Editing? Diffusion-Driven Approach with Multi-Grained Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05276v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in time series generation have shown promise, yet controlling properties in generated sequences remains challenging. Time Series Editing (TSE) - making precise modifications while preserving temporal coherence - consider both point-level constraints and segment-level controls that current methods struggle to provide. We introduce the CocktailEdit framework to enable simultaneous, flexible control across different types of constraints. This framework combines two key mechanisms: a confidence-weighted anchor control for point-wise constraints and a classifier-based control for managing statistical properties such as sums and averages over segments. Our methods achieve precise local control during the denoising inference stage while maintaining temporal coherence and integrating seamlessly, with any conditionally trained diffusion-based time series models. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and models demonstrate its effectiveness. Our work bridges the gap between pure generative modeling and real-world time series editing needs, offering a flexible solution for human-in-the-loop time series generation and editing. The code and demo are provided for validation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context is Key: A Benchmark for Forecasting with Essential Textual Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18959v4)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting is a critical task in decision-making across numerous domains. While historical numerical data provide a start, they fail to convey the complete context for reliable and accurate predictions. Human forecasters frequently rely on additional information, such as background knowledge and constraints, which can efficiently be communicated through natural language. However, in spite of recent progress with LLM-based forecasters, their ability to effectively integrate this textual information remains an open question. To address this, we introduce "Context is Key" (CiK), a time-series forecasting benchmark that pairs numerical data with diverse types of carefully crafted textual context, requiring models to integrate both modalities; crucially, every task in CiK requires understanding textual context to be solved successfully. We evaluate a range of approaches, including statistical models, time series foundation models, and LLM-based forecasters, and propose a simple yet effective LLM prompting method that outperforms all other tested methods on our benchmark. Our experiments highlight the importance of incorporating contextual information, demonstrate surprising performance when using LLM-based forecasting models, and also reveal some of their critical shortcomings. This benchmark aims to advance multimodal forecasting by promoting models that are both accurate and accessible to decision-makers with varied technical expertise. The benchmark can be visualized at https://servicenow.github.io/context-is-key-forecasting/v0/.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025.

| **[Learning long range dependencies through time reversal symmetry breaking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05259v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep State Space Models (SSMs) reignite physics-grounded compute paradigms, as RNNs could natively be embodied into dynamical systems. This calls for dedicated learning algorithms obeying to core physical principles, with efficient techniques to simulate these systems and guide their design. We propose Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning (RHEL), an algorithm which provably computes loss gradients as finite differences of physical trajectories of non-dissipative, Hamiltonian systems. In ML terms, RHEL only requires three "forward passes" irrespective of model size, without explicit Jacobian computation, nor incurring any variance in the gradient estimation. Motivated by the physical realization of our algorithm, we first introduce RHEL in continuous time and demonstrate its formal equivalence with the continuous adjoint state method. To facilitate the simulation of Hamiltonian systems trained by RHEL, we propose a discrete-time version of RHEL which is equivalent to Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when applied to a class of recurrent modules which we call Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs). This setting allows us to demonstrate the scalability of RHEL by generalizing these results to hierarchies of HRUs, which we call Hamiltonian SSMs (HSSMs). We apply RHEL to train HSSMs with linear and nonlinear dynamics on a variety of time-series tasks ranging from mid-range to long-range classification and regression with sequence length reaching $\sim 50k$. We show that RHEL consistently matches the performance of BPTT across all models and tasks. This work opens new doors for the design of scalable, energy-efficient physical systems endowed with self-learning capabilities for sequence modelling.</p></details> | 45 pages |
| **[Robust Moment Identification for Nonlinear PDEs via a Neural ODE Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05245v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a data-driven framework for learning reduced-order moment dynamics from PDE-governed systems using Neural ODEs. In contrast to derivative-based methods like SINDy, which necessitate densely sampled data and are sensitive to noise, our approach based on Neural ODEs directly models moment trajectories, enabling robust learning from sparse and potentially irregular time series. Using as an application platform the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the framework accurately recovers governing moment dynamics when closure is available, even with limited and irregular observations. For systems without analytical closure, we introduce a data-driven coordinate transformation strategy based on Stiefel manifold optimization, enabling the discovery of low-dimensional representations in which the moment dynamics become closed, facilitating interpretable and reliable modeling. We also explore cases where a closure model is not known, such as a Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion system. Here we demonstrate that Neural ODEs can still effectively approximate the unclosed moment dynamics and achieve superior extrapolation accuracy compared to physical-expert-derived ODE models. This advantage remains robust even under sparse and irregular sampling, highlighting the method's robustness in data-limited settings. Our results highlight the Neural ODE framework as a powerful and flexible tool for learning interpretable, low-dimensional moment dynamics in complex PDE-governed systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Timing is Important: Risk-aware Fund Allocation based on Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24835v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fund allocation has been an increasingly important problem in the financial domain. In reality, we aim to allocate the funds to buy certain assets within a certain future period. Naive solutions such as prediction-only or Predict-then-Optimize approaches suffer from goal mismatch. Additionally, the introduction of the SOTA time series forecasting model inevitably introduces additional uncertainty in the predicted result. To solve both problems mentioned above, we introduce a Risk-aware Time-Series Predict-and-Allocate (RTS-PnO) framework, which holds no prior assumption on the forecasting models. Such a framework contains three features: (i) end-to-end training with objective alignment measurement, (ii) adaptive forecasting uncertainty calibration, and (iii) agnostic towards forecasting models.

| **[Causal Discovery from Conditionally Stationary Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06257v4)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery, i.e., inferring underlying causal relationships from observational data, is highly challenging for AI systems. In a time series modeling context, traditional causal discovery methods mainly consider constrained scenarios with fully observed variables and/or data from stationary time-series. We develop a causal discovery approach to handle a wide class of nonstationary time series that are conditionally stationary, where the nonstationary behaviour is modeled as stationarity conditioned on a set of latent state variables. Named State-Dependent Causal Inference (SDCI), our approach is able to recover the underlying causal dependencies, with provable identifiablity for the state-dependent causal structures. Empirical experiments on nonlinear particle interaction data and gene regulatory networks demonstrate SDCI's superior performance over baseline causal discovery methods. Improved results over non-causal RNNs on modeling NBA player movements demonstrate the potential of our method and motivate the use of causality-driven methods for forecasting.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

This progress has inspired a series of innovative studies that explore the adaptation of PLMs to time series analysis, intending to create a unified foundation model that addresses various time series analytical tasks. However, these efforts predominantly focus on Regularly Sampled Time Series (RSTS), neglecting the unique challenges posed by Irregularly Sampled Time Series (ISTS), which are characterized by uneven sampling intervals and prevalent missing data. To bridge this gap, this work takes the first step in exploring the potential of PLMs for ISTS analysis. We begin by investigating the effect of various methods for representing ISTS, aiming to maximize the efficacy of PLMs in the analysis. Furthermore, we propose a unified PLM-based framework, named ISTS-PLM, to address diverse ISTS analytical tasks. It integrates novel time-aware and variable-aware PLMs tailored to tackle the intractable intra- and inter-time series modeling in ISTS. Finally, extensive experiments on a comprehensive benchmark demonstrate that the ISTS-PLM, utilizing a structured and effective series-based representation for ISTS, consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across various analytical tasks, such as classification, interpolation, extrapolation, few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios, spanning scientific domains like healthcare, biomechanics, and climate science.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD'25 |
| **[Goal-Oriented Time-Series Forecasting: Foundation Framework Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17493v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional time-series forecasting often focuses only on minimizing prediction errors, ignoring the specific requirements of real-world applications that employ them. This paper presents a new training methodology, which allows a forecasting model to dynamically adjust its focus based on the importance of forecast ranges specified by the end application. Unlike previous methods that fix these ranges beforehand, our training approach breaks down predictions over the entire signal range into smaller segments, which are then dynamically weighted and combined to produce accurate forecasts within a region of interest. We tested our method on standard datasets, including a new wireless communication dataset, and found that not only it improves prediction accuracy but also enhances the performance of end application employing the forecasting model. This research provides a basis for creating forecasting systems that better connect prediction and decision-making in various practical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, critical values strongly depend on the noise distribution, and we argue that existing methods are either statistically infeasible, or asymptotically sub-optimal. To address this methodological challenge, we show how to develop a feasible multiscale test via weak convergence arguments, by replacing the additive multiscale penalty with a multiplicative weighting. This new theoretical foundation preserves the optimal detection properties of multiscale tests and extends their applicability to nonstationary nonlinear time series via a tailored bootstrap scheme. Inference for signal discovery, goodness-of-fit testing of regression functions, and multiple changepoint detection is studied in detail, and we apply the new methodology to analyze the April 2025 power blackout on the Iberian peninsula. Our methodology is enabled by a novel functional central limit in H\"older spaces with critical modulus of continuity, where Donsker's theorem fails to hold due to lack of tightness. Probabilistically, we discover a novel form of thresholded weak convergence that holds only in the upper support of the distribution.</p></details> | 41 pages, 4 figures |

Our analysis shows that conventional Integrated Gradients (IG) effectively capture critical points with both positive and negative impacts on predictions. However, current evaluation metrics fail to assess this capability, as they inadvertently cancel out opposing feature contributions. To address this limitation, we propose novel evaluation metrics-Cumulative Prediction Difference (CPD) and Cumulative Prediction Preservation (CPP)-to systematically assess whether attribution methods accurately identify significant positive and negative points in time series XAI. Under these metrics, conventional IG outperforms recent counterparts. However, directly applying IG to time series data may lead to suboptimal outcomes, as generated paths ignore temporal relationships and introduce out-of-distribution samples. To overcome these challenges, we introduce TIMING, which enhances IG by incorporating temporal awareness while maintaining its theoretical properties. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series benchmarks demonstrate that TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines.

Recent advances in deep learning and large scale language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in capturing sentiment and other qualitative signals, thereby enhancing the accuracy of financial time series predictions. Despite these advances, most existing datasets consist solely of price series and news text, are confined to a single market, and remain limited in scale. In this paper, we introduce FinMultiTime, the first large scale, multimodal financial time series dataset. FinMultiTime temporally aligns four distinct modalities financial news, structured financial tables, K-line technical charts, and stock price time series across both the S&P 500 and HS 300 universes. Covering 5,105 stocks from 2009 to 2025 in the United States and China, the dataset totals 112.6 GB and provides minute-level, daily, and quarterly resolutions, thus capturing short, medium, and long term market signals with high fidelity. Our experiments demonstrate that (1) scale and data quality markedly boost prediction accuracy; (2) multimodal fusion yields moderate gains in Transformer models; and (3) a fully reproducible pipeline enables seamless dataset updates.</p></details> | Under review |

Token merging has emerged as a solution to increase computational efficiency in computer vision architectures. In this work, we perform the first investigations of token merging in time series analysis on both transformers and state-space models. We further introduce local merging, a domain-specific token merging algorithm that selectively combines tokens within a local neighborhood, achieving two major benefits: a) Local merging can adjust its computational complexity from quadratic to linear based on the neighborhood size to effectively scale to long sequences; b) Local merging is the first causal merging scheme enabling token merging in transformer decoders. Further, we identify spectral properties of the input data that reliably predict the potential benefits of local merging without requiring evaluation on downstream tasks. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that local merging offers substantial efficiency gains with minimal impact on accuracy, achieving up to 5400% acceleration on the recently proposed Chronos foundation model.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages in total, 20 figures</p></details> |

Learning parameters from time series data is one of the few available options to obtain improved impedance models. This paper presents an approach that combines statistical learning concepts with the exploitation of domain knowledge, in the form of Carson's equations, through nonlinear mathematical optimization. The proposed approach derives impedance matrices for up-to-four-wire systems, using measurement data like those obtained from smart meters. Despite the lack of phasor measurements, the low signal-to-noise ratio of smart meter measurements, and the inherent existence of multiple equivalent solutions, our method produces good quality impedance models that are fit for power system calculations, significantly improving on our previous work both in terms of accuracy and computational time.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Open Source Validation System for Continuous Arterial Blood Pressure Measuring Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07973v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Measuring the blood pressure waveform is becoming a more frequently studied area. The development of sensor technologies opens many new ways to be able to measure high-quality signals. The development of such an aim-specific sensor can be time-consuming, expensive, and difficult to test or validate with known and consistent waveforms. In this paper, we present an open source blood pressure waveform simulator with an open source Python validation package to reduce development costs for early-stage sensor development and research. The simulator mainly consists of 3D printed parts which technology has become a widely available and cheap solution. The core part of the simulator is a 3D printed cam that can be generated based on real blood pressure waveforms. The validation framework can create a detailed comparison between the signal waveform used to design the cam and the measured time series from the sensor being validated. The presented simulator proved to be robust and accurate in short- and long-term use, as it produced the signal waveform consistently and accurately. To validate this solution, a 3D force sensor was used, which was proven earlier to be able to measure high-quality blood pressure waveforms on the radial artery at the wrist. The results showed high similarity between the measured and the nominal waveforms, meaning that comparing the normalized signals, the RMSE value ranged from $0.0276 \pm 0.0047$ to $0.0212 \pm 0.0023$, and the Pearson correlation ranged from $0.9933 \pm 0.0027$ to $0.9978 \pm 0.0005$.

Although increasingly capable TSF methods occur, many of them require domain-specific data collection and model training and do not generalize well when applied in other domains. Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) that are pre-trained on massive heterogeneous time series data aim to overcome these limitations. The prospects for generalizability have spurred the development of a new generation of TSFMs. This study proposes a benchmark, TSFM-Bench, to facilitate comprehensive and unified evaluation of TSFMs. TSFM-Bench covers a wide range of TSFMs, including those based on large language models and those pre-trained on time series data. TSFM-Bench supports multiple forecasting scenarios, including zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot, enabling assessment across the full range of adaptation strategies. TSFM-Bench also provides a standardized experimental protocols for critical evaluation processes such as dataset splitting, loading, normalization, and few-shot sampling, facilitating consistency and fairness. We report on an extensive evaluation of TSFMs across a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and exhibiting varied statistical characteristics. Specifically, we identify pros and cons and inherent limitations of existing TSFMs, and we propose potential directions for new model designs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Event Classification of Accelerometer Data for Industrial Package Monitoring with Embedded Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05435v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Package monitoring is an important topic in industrial applications, with significant implications for operational efficiency and ecological sustainability. In this study, we propose an approach that employs an embedded system, placed on reusable packages, to detect their state (on a Forklift, in a Truck, or in an undetermined location). We aim to design a system with a lifespan of several years, corresponding to the lifespan of reusable packages. Our analysis demonstrates that maximizing device lifespan requires minimizing wake time. We propose a pipeline that includes data processing, training, and evaluation of the deep learning model designed for imbalanced, multiclass time series data collected from an embedded sensor. The method uses a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network architecture to classify accelerometer data from the IoT device. Before training, two data augmentation techniques are tested to solve the imbalance problem of the dataset: the Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique and the ADAptive SYNthetic sampling approach. After training, compression techniques are implemented to have a small model size. On the considered twoclass problem, the methodology yields a precision of 94.54% for the first class and 95.83% for the second class, while compression techniques reduce the model size by a factor of four. The trained model is deployed on the IoT device, where it operates with a power consumption of 316 mW during inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed lag non-linear models with Laplacian-P-splines for analysis of spatially structured time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04814v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM) have gained popularity for modeling nonlinear lagged relationships between exposures and outcomes. When applied to spatially referenced data, these models must account for spatial dependence, a challenge that has yet to be thoroughly explored within the penalized DLNM framework. This gap is mainly due to the complex model structure and high computational demands, particularly when dealing with large spatio-temporal datasets. To address this, we propose a novel Bayesian DLNM-Laplacian-P-splines (DLNM-LPS) approach that incorporates spatial dependence using conditional autoregressive (CAR) priors, a method commonly applied in disease mapping. Our approach offers a flexible framework for capturing nonlinear associations while accounting for spatial dependence. It uses the Laplace approximation to approximate the conditional posterior distribution of the regression parameters, eliminating the need for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, often used in Bayesian inference, thus improving computational efficiency. The methodology is evaluated through simulation studies and applied to analyze the relationship between temperature and mortality in London.</p></details> |  |
| **[Augmented Invertible Koopman Autoencoder for long-term time series forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12930v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Following the introduction of Dynamic Mode Decomposition and its numerous extensions, many neural autoencoder-based implementations of the Koopman operator have recently been proposed. This class of methods appears to be of interest for modeling dynamical systems, either through direct long-term prediction of the evolution of the state or as a powerful embedding for downstream methods. In particular, a recent line of work has developed invertible Koopman autoencoders (IKAEs), which provide an exact reconstruction of the input state thanks to their analytically invertible encoder, based on coupling layer normalizing flow models. We identify that the conservation of the dimension imposed by the normalizing flows is a limitation for the IKAE models, and thus we propose to augment the latent state with a second, non-invertible encoder network. This results in our new model: the Augmented Invertible Koopman AutoEncoder (AIKAE). We demonstrate the relevance of the AIKAE through a series of long-term time series forecasting experiments, on satellite image time series as well as on a benchmark involving predictions based on a large lookback window of observations.</p></details> |  |

To asses it, we evaluated ten base models and eight ensemble configurations across two large-scale retail datasets (M5 and VN1), considering both point and probabilistic accuracy under varying retraining frequencies. We showed that ensembles consistently improve forecasting performance, particularly in probabilistic settings. However, these gains come at a substantial computational cost, especially for larger, accuracy-driven ensembles. We found that reducing retraining frequency significantly lowers costs, with minimal impact on accuracy, particularly for point forecasts. Moreover, efficiency-driven ensembles offer a strong balance, achieving competitive accuracy with considerably lower costs compared to accuracy-optimized combinations. Most importantly, small ensembles of two or three models are often sufficient to achieve near-optimal results. These findings provide practical guidelines for deploying scalable and cost-efficient forecasting systems, supporting the broader goals of sustainable AI in forecasting. Overall, this work shows that careful ensemble design and retraining strategy selection can yield accurate, robust, and cost-effective forecasts suitable for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proactive Model Adaptation Against Concept Drift for Online Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08435v4)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting always faces the challenge of concept drift, where data distributions evolve over time, leading to a decline in forecast model performance. Existing solutions are based on online learning, which continually organize recent time series observations as new training samples and update model parameters according to the forecasting feedback on recent data. However, they overlook a critical issue: obtaining ground-truth future values of each sample should be delayed until after the forecast horizon. This delay creates a temporal gap between the training samples and the test sample. Our empirical analysis reveals that the gap can introduce concept drift, causing forecast models to adapt to outdated concepts. In this paper, we present Proceed, a novel proactive model adaptation framework for online time series forecasting. Proceed first estimates the concept drift between the recently used training samples and the current test sample. It then employs an adaptation generator to efficiently translate the estimated drift into parameter adjustments, proactively adapting the model to the test sample. To enhance the generalization capability of the framework, Proceed is trained on synthetic diverse concept drifts. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets across various forecast models demonstrate that Proceed brings more performance improvements than the state-of-the-art online learning methods, significantly facilitating forecast models' resilience against concept drifts.

| **[Foundation Models Knowledge Distillation For Battery Capacity Degradation Forecast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08151v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimation of lithium-ion battery capacity degradation is critical for enhancing the reliability and safety of battery operations. Traditional expert models, tailored to specific scenarios, provide isolated estimations. With the rapid advancement of data-driven techniques, a series of general-purpose time-series foundation models have been developed. However, foundation models specifically designed for battery capacity degradation remain largely unexplored. To enable zero-shot generalization in battery degradation prediction using large model technology, this study proposes a degradation-aware fine-tuning strategy for time-series foundation models. We apply this strategy to fine-tune the Timer model on approximately 10 GB of open-source battery charge discharge data. Validation on our released CycleLife-SJTUIE dataset demonstrates that the fine-tuned Battery-Timer possesses strong zero-shot generalization capability in capacity degradation forecasting. To address the computational challenges of deploying large models, we further propose a knowledge distillation framework that transfers the knowledge of pre-trained foundation models into compact expert models. Distillation results across several state-of-the-art time-series expert models confirm that foundation model knowledge significantly improves the multi-condition generalization of expert models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural MJD: Neural Non-Stationary Merton Jump Diffusion for Time Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04542v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While deep learning methods have achieved strong performance in time series prediction, their black-box nature and inability to explicitly model underlying stochastic processes often limit their generalization to non-stationary data, especially in the presence of abrupt changes. In this work, we introduce Neural MJD, a neural network based non-stationary Merton jump diffusion (MJD) model. Our model explicitly formulates forecasting as a stochastic differential equation (SDE) simulation problem, combining a time-inhomogeneous It\^o diffusion to capture non-stationary stochastic dynamics with a time-inhomogeneous compound Poisson process to model abrupt jumps. To enable tractable learning, we introduce a likelihood truncation mechanism that caps the number of jumps within small time intervals and provide a theoretical error bound for this approximation. Additionally, we propose an Euler-Maruyama with restart solver, which achieves a provably lower error bound in estimating expected states and reduced variance compared to the standard solver. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Neural MJD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical learning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing parameter identifiability of a hemodynamics PDE model using spectral surrogates and dimension reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04538v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational inverse problems for biomedical simulators suffer from limited data and relatively high parameter dimensionality. This often requires sensitivity analysis, where parameters of the model are ranked based on their influence on the specific quantities of interest. This is especially important for simulators used to build medical digital twins, as the amount of data is typically limited. For expensive models, such as blood flow models, emulation is employed to expedite the simulation time. Parameter ranking and fixing using sensitivity analysis are often heuristic, though, and vary with the specific application or simulator used. The present study provides an innovative solution to this problem by leveraging polynomial chaos expansions (PCEs) for both multioutput global sensitivity analysis and formal parameter identifiability. For the former, we use dimension reduction to efficiently quantify time-series sensitivity of a one-dimensional pulmonary hemodynamics model. We consider both Windkessel and structured tree boundary conditions. We then use PCEs to construct profile-likelihood confidence intervals to formally assess parameter identifiability, and show how changes in experimental design improve identifiability. Our work presents a novel approach to determining parameter identifiability and leverages a common emulation strategy for enabling profile-likelihood analysis in problems governed by partial differential equations.</p></details> | 30 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Smoothing Variances Across Time: Adaptive Stochastic Volatility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11315v4)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel Bayesian framework for estimating time-varying volatility by extending the Random Walk Stochastic Volatility (RWSV) model with Dynamic Shrinkage Processes (DSP) in log-variances. Unlike the classical Stochastic Volatility (SV) or GARCH-type models with restrictive parametric stationarity assumptions, our proposed Adaptive Stochastic Volatility (ASV) model provides smooth yet dynamically adaptive estimates of evolving volatility and its uncertainty. We further enhance the model by incorporating a nugget effect, allowing it to flexibly capture small-scale variability while preserving smoothness elsewhere. We derive the theoretical properties of the global-local shrinkage prior DSP. Through simulation studies, we show that ASV exhibits remarkable misspecification resilience and low prediction error across various data-generating processes. Furthermore, ASV's capacity to yield locally smooth and interpretable estimates facilitates a clearer understanding of the underlying patterns and trends in volatility. As an extension, we develop the Bayesian Trend Filter with ASV (BTF-ASV) which allows joint modeling of the mean and volatility with abrupt changes. Finally, our proposed models are applied to time series data from finance, econometrics, and environmental science, highlighting their flexibility and broad applicability.</p></details> |  |

Each process may correspond to a spatial location for field data, or to an experimental ecosystem in a designed experiment. Statistical models for ecological panel data should capture the high levels of nonlinearity, stochasticity, and measurement uncertainty inherent in ecological systems. Furthermore, the system dynamics may depend on unobservable variables. This study applies iterated particle filtering techniques to explore new possibilities for likelihood-based statistical analysis of these complex systems. We analyze data from a mesocosm experiment in which two species of the freshwater planktonic crustacean genus, {\it Daphnia}, coexist with an alga and a fungal parasite. Time series data were collected on replicated mesocosms under six treatment conditions. Iterated filtering enables maximization of the likelihood for scientifically motivated nonlinear partially observed Markov process models, providing access to standard likelihood-based methods for parameter estimation, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, model selection and diagnostics. This toolbox allows scientists to propose and evaluate scientifically motivated stochastic dynamic models for panel data, constrained only by the requirement to write code to simulate from the model and to specify a measurement distribution describing how the system state is observed.</p></details> | 35 pages, 4 figures |

The goal is to introduce a method that avoids premature or delayed detection, which can lead to inaccurate or inefficient performance analysis. The proposed approach adapts techniques from the chemical reactors domain, detecting steady states online through the combination of kernel-based step detection and statistical methods. By using a window-based approach, it provides detailed information and improves the accuracy of identifying phase transitions, even in noisy or irregular time series. Results show that the new approach reduces total error by 14.5% compared to the state-of-the-art method. It offers more reliable detection of the steady-state onset, delivering greater precision for benchmarking tasks. For users, the new approach enhances the accuracy and stability of performance benchmarking, efficiently handling diverse time series data. Its robustness and adaptability make it a valuable tool for real-world performance evaluation, ensuring consistent and reproducible results.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is under review by Future Generation Computer Systems</p></details> |

CatNet employs the derivative of SHAP values to quantify the feature importance, and constructs a vector-formed mirror statistic for FDR control with the Gaussian Mirror algorithm. To avoid instability due to nonlinear or temporal correlations among features, we also propose a new kernel-based independence measure. CatNet performs robustly on different model settings with both simulated and real-world data, which reduces overfitting and improves interpretability of the model. Our framework that introduces SHAP for feature importance in FDR control algorithms and improves Gaussian Mirror can be naturally extended to other time-series or sequential deep learning models.</p></details> |  |

These inputs are useful for diverse remote sensing tasks, such as crop mapping and flood detection. However, learning shared representations of remote sensing data is challenging, given the diversity of relevant data modalities, and because objects of interest vary massively in scale, from small boats (1-2 pixels and fast) to glaciers (thousands of pixels and slow). We present a novel self-supervised learning algorithm that extracts multi-scale features across a flexible set of input modalities through masked modeling. Our dual global and local contrastive losses differ in their targets (deep representations vs. shallow input projections) and masking strategies (structured vs. not). Our Galileo is a single generalist model that outperforms SoTA specialist models for satellite images and pixel time series across eleven benchmarks and multiple tasks.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes Causality-Aware contrastive learning for RObust multivariate Time-Series (CAROTS), a novel MTSAD pipeline that incorporates the notion of causality into contrastive learning. CAROTS employs two data augmentors to obtain causality-preserving and -disturbing samples that serve as a wide range of normal variations and synthetic anomalies, respectively. With causality-preserving and -disturbing samples as positives and negatives, CAROTS performs contrastive learning to train an encoder whose latent space separates normal and abnormal samples based on causality. Moreover, CAROTS introduces a similarity-filtered one-class contrastive loss that encourages the contrastive learning process to gradually incorporate more semantically diverse samples with common causal relationships. Extensive experiments on five real-world and two synthetic datasets validate that the integration of causal relationships endows CAROTS with improved MTSAD capabilities.

The dimension of the temporal measurement vector is lower than that of the temporal state vector to be estimated, leading to an under-determined inverse problem. The underlying dynamical model of the state's evolution is unknown for a 'model-free process.' Hence, it is difficult to use traditional model-driven methods, for example, Kalman and particle filters. Instead, we consider data-driven methods. We experimentally show that two existing unsupervised learning-based data-driven methods fail to address the BSCM problem in a model-free process. The methods are -- data-driven nonlinear state estimation (DANSE) and deep Markov model (DMM). While DANSE provides good predictive/forecasting performance to model the temporal measurement data as a time series, its unsupervised learning lacks suitable regularization for tackling the BSCM task. We then propose a semi-supervised learning approach and develop a semi-supervised learning-based DANSE method, referred to as SemiDANSE. In SemiDANSE, we use a large amount of unlabelled data along with a limited amount of labelled data, i.e., pairwise measurement-and-state data, which provides the desired regularization. Using three benchmark dynamical systems, we empirically show that the data-driven SemiDANSE provides competitive state estimation performance for BSCM using a handful of different measurement systems, against a hybrid method called KalmanNet and two model-driven methods (extended Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter) that know the dynamical models exactly.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 12 figures, under review in IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</p></details> |

Unfortunately they work for small data only. In turn they are not attractive to offer reasons for events, e.g., tracking causal changes over multiple time steps, or a behavioral component that involves feedback loops through actions of an agent. To this end, we generalize SCEs to a (recursive) formulation of explanation trees to capture the temporal interactions between reasons. We show the benefits of this more general SCE algorithm on synthetic time-series data and a 2D grid game, and further compare it to the base SCE and other existing methods for causal explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main paper: 9 pages, References: 2 pages, Supplementary: 9 pages.

Although knowledge graphs offer a powerful means to contextualize these data, existing approaches to integrating knowledge graphs with time series data lack a concept to model the continuous temporal values inherent in CPSs. This gap can make expressing computations on the sensor data cumbersome. In this work, we propose the integration of knowledge graphs and signals, a proven concept for modeling temporal values. By treating signals as first-class citizens in query languages, we can enable seamless querying over knowledge graphs and signals. While the knowledge graph captures information on the CPS, signals represent its run-time data from sensors. We discuss the implications of such an approach and propose SigSPARQL, an extension to the SPARQL query language, to demonstrate these concepts. Furthermore, we evaluate the feasibility of implementing SigSPARQL with a prototype and demonstrate the applicability of the query language for a monitoring use case within a CPS.</p></details> |  |

While the standard self attention only makes use of the inner product of queries and keys, it is demonstrated that the keys, queries and softmax are not necessary for obtaining the attention score required to capture long-term dependencies in temporal sequences. Through the singular-value decomposition (SVD) on the softmax attention score, we further observe that self attention compresses the contributions from both queries and keys in the space spanned by the attention score. Therefore, our proposed easy-attention method directly treats the attention scores as learnable parameters. This approach produces excellent results when reconstructing and predicting the temporal dynamics of chaotic systems exhibiting more robustness and less complexity than self attention or the widely-used long short-term memory (LSTM) network. We show the improved performance of the easy-attention method in the Lorenz system, a turbulence shear flow and a model of a nuclear reactor.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages and 6 figures</p></details> |

Hence, spatial-aware pretext tasks have been actively explored in self-supervised learning. Existing works commonly start from a grid structure, where the goal of the pretext task involves predicting the absolute position index of patches within a fixed grid. However, grid-based approaches fall short of capturing the fluid and continuous nature of real-world object compositions. We introduce PART, a self-supervised learning approach that leverages continuous relative transformations between off-grid patches to overcome these limitations. By modeling how parts relate to each other in a continuous space, PART learns the relative composition of images-an off-grid structural relative positioning process that generalizes beyond occlusions and deformations. In tasks requiring precise spatial understanding such as object detection and time series prediction, PART outperforms strong grid-based methods like MAE and DropPos, while also maintaining competitive performance on global classification tasks with minimal hyperparameter tuning. By breaking free from grid constraints, PART opens up an exciting new trajectory for universal self-supervised pretraining across diverse datatypes-from natural images to EEG signals-with promising potential in video, medical imaging, and audio.</p></details> |  |
| **[SF$^2$Bench: Evaluating Data-Driven Models for Compound Flood Forecasting in South Florida](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04281v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting compound floods presents a significant challenge due to the intricate interplay of meteorological, hydrological, and oceanographic factors. Analyzing compound floods has become more critical as the global climate increases flood risks. Traditional physics-based methods, such as the Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System, are often time-inefficient. Machine learning has recently demonstrated promise in both modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the scarcity of comprehensive datasets currently hinders systematic analysis. Existing water-related datasets are often limited by a sparse network of monitoring stations and incomplete coverage of relevant factors. To address this challenge, we introduce SF2Bench, a comprehensive time series collection on compound floods in South Florida, which integrates four key factors: tide, rainfall, groundwater, and human management activities (gate and pump controlling). This integration allows for a more detailed analysis of the individual contributions of these drivers to compound flooding and informs the development of improved flood forecasting approaches. To comprehensively evaluate the potential of various modeling paradigms, we assess the performance of six categories of methods, encompassing Multilayer Perceptrons, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Graph Neural Networks, Transformers, and Large Language Models. We verified the impact of different key features on flood forecasting through experiments. Our analysis examines temporal and spatial aspects, providing insights into the influence of historical data and spatial dependencies. The varying performance across these approaches underscores the diverse capabilities of each in capturing complex temporal and spatial dependencies inherent in compound floods.</p></details> | 60 Pages |

Recently, there has been initial exploration of applying diffusion models to time series tasks. However, existing studies still face challenges in multi-scale feature alignment and generative capabilities across different entities and long-time scales. In this paper, we propose CHIME, a conditional hallucination and integrated multi-scale enhancement framework for time series diffusion models. By employing multi-scale decomposition and adaptive integration, CHIME captures the decomposed features of time series, achieving in-domain distribution alignment between generated and original samples. In addition, we introduce a feature hallucination module in the conditional denoising process, enabling the transfer of temporal features through the training of category-independent transformation layers. Experimental results on publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that CHIME achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits excellent generative generalization capabilities in few-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce VISTA (Vision-Language Inference for Stock Time-series Analysis), a novel, training-free framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-modal stock forecasting. VISTA prompts a VLM with both textual representations of historical stock prices and their corresponding line charts to predict future price values. By combining numerical and visual modalities in a zero-shot setting and using carefully designed chain-of-thought prompts, VISTA captures complementary patterns that unimodal approaches often miss. We benchmark VISTA against standard baselines, including ARIMA and text-only LLM-based prompting methods. Experimental results show that VISTA outperforms these baselines by up to 89.83%, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal inference for stock time-series analysis and highlighting the potential of VLMs in financial forecasting tasks without requiring task-specific training.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches using NDRE often detect stress only after visible symptoms appear or require labeled datasets, limiting scalability. This study introduces EigenCL, a novel unsupervised contrastive learning framework guided by temporal NDRE dynamics and biologically grounded eigen decomposition. Using over 10,000 Sentinel-2 NDRE image patches from drought-affected Iowa cornfields, we constructed five-point NDRE time series per patch and derived an RBF similarity matrix. The principal eigenvector explaining 76% of the variance and strongly correlated (r = 0.95) with raw NDRE values was used to define stress-aware similarity for contrastive embedding learning. Unlike existing methods that rely on visual augmentations, EigenCL pulls embeddings together based on biologically similar stress trajectories and pushes apart divergent ones. The learned embeddings formed physiologically meaningful clusters, achieving superior clustering metrics (Silhouette: 0.748, DBI: 0.35) and enabling 76% early stress detection up to 12 days before conventional NDRE thresholds. Downstream classification yielded 95% k-NN and 91% logistic regression accuracy. Validation on an independent 2023 Nebraska dataset confirmed generalizability without retraining. EigenCL offers a label-free, scalable approach for early stress detection that aligns with underlying plant physiology and is suitable for real-world deployment in data-scarce agricultural environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Necessity of Multi-Domain Explanation: An Uncertainty Principle Approach for Deep Time Series Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03267v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A prevailing approach to explain time series models is to generate attribution in time domain. A recent development in time series XAI is the concept of explanation spaces, where any model trained in the time domain can be interpreted with any existing XAI method in alternative domains, such as frequency. The prevailing approach is to present XAI attributions either in the time domain or in the domain where the attribution is most sparse. In this paper, we demonstrate that in certain cases, XAI methods can generate attributions that highlight fundamentally different features in the time and frequency domains that are not direct counterparts of one another. This suggests that both domains' attributions should be presented to achieve a more comprehensive interpretation. Thus it shows the necessity of multi-domain explanation. To quantify when such cases arise, we introduce the uncertainty principle (UP), originally developed in quantum mechanics and later studied in harmonic analysis and signal processing, to the XAI literature. This principle establishes a lower bound on how much a signal can be simultaneously localized in both the time and frequency domains. By leveraging this concept, we assess whether attributions in the time and frequency domains violate this bound, indicating that they emphasize distinct features. In other words, UP provides a sufficient condition that the time and frequency domain explanations do not match and, hence, should be both presented to the end user. We validate the effectiveness of this approach across various deep learning models, XAI methods, and a wide range of classification and forecasting datasets. The frequent occurrence of UP violations across various datasets and XAI methods highlights the limitations of existing approaches that focus solely on time-domain explanations. This underscores the need for multi-domain explanations as a new paradigm.</p></details> |  |

However, existing pretrained models either do not support covariates or fail to incorporate them effectively. We introduce COSMIC, a zero-shot forecasting model that utilizes covariates via in-context learning. To address the challenge of data scarcity, we propose Informative Covariate Augmentation, which enables the training of COSMIC without requiring any datasets that include covariates. COSMIC achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot forecasting, both with and without covariates. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis demonstrates that COSMIC effectively leverages covariates in zero-shot forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was written at the end of 2024</p></details> |

However, the plethora of model formulations, the inconsistent use of terminology, and the various inferential approaches and software packages can be overwhelming to practitioners, especially when they are new to this area. With this review-like paper, we thus aim to provide guidance for both statisticians and practitioners working with latent Markov models by offering a unifying view on what otherwise are often considered separate model classes, from hidden Markov models over state-space models to Markov-modulated Poisson processes. In particular, we provide a roadmap for identifying a suitable latent Markov model formulation given the data to be analysed. Furthermore, we emphasise that it is key to applied work with any of these model classes to understand how recursive techniques exploiting the models' dependence structure can be used for inference. The R package LaMa adapts this unified view and provides an easy-to-use framework for very fast (C++ based) numerical maximum likelihood estimation of any of the models discussed in this paper, allowing users to tailor a latent Markov model to their data using a Lego-type approach.</p></details> | 52 pages, 7 figures |

Firstly, the basic information and transaction data of popular NFTs on the Solana chain are collected using the Selenium tool. Secondly, the transaction records of the Magic Eden trading market are thoroughly analyzed by combining them with the Scrapy framework to examine the price fluctuations and market trends of NFTs. In terms of data analysis, this paper employs time series analysis to examine the dynamics of the NFT market and seeks to identify potential price patterns. In addition, the risk and return of different NFTs are evaluated using the mean-variance optimization model, taking into account their characteristics, such as illiquidity and market volatility, to provide investors with data-driven portfolio recommendations. The experimental results show that the combination of crawler technology and financial analytics can effectively analyze NFT data on the Solana blockchain and provide timely market insights and investment strategies. This study provides a reference for further exploration in the field of digital currencies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Binary Cumulative Encoding meets Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24595v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies in time series forecasting have explored formulating regression via classification task. By discretizing the continuous target space into bins and predicting over a fixed set of classes, these approaches benefit from stable training, robust uncertainty modeling, and compatibility with modern deep learning architectures. However, most existing methods rely on one-hot encoding that ignores the inherent ordinal structure of the underlying values. As a result, they fail to provide information about the relative distance between predicted and true values during training. In this paper, we propose to address this limitation by introducing binary cumulative encoding (BCE), that represents scalar targets into monotonic binary vectors. This encoding implicitly preserves order and magnitude information, allowing the model to learn distance-aware representations while still operating within a classification framework. We propose a convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed for BCE, incorporating residual and dilated convolutions to enable fast and expressive temporal modeling. Through extensive experiments on benchmark forecasting datasets, we show that our approach outperforms widely used methods in both point and probabilistic forecasting, while requiring fewer parameters and enabling faster training.</p></details> |  |

Due to the time-intensive nature of shapelet discovery, existing shapelet-based methods mainly focus on selecting discriminative shapes while discarding others to achieve candidate subsequence sparsification. However, this approach may exclude beneficial shapes and overlook the varying contributions of shapelets to classification performance. To this end, we propose a Soft sparse Shapes (SoftShape) model for efficient time series classification. Our approach mainly introduces soft shape sparsification and soft shape learning blocks. The former transforms shapes into soft representations based on classification contribution scores, merging lower-scored ones into a single shape to retain and differentiate all subsequence information. The latter facilitates intra- and inter-shape temporal pattern learning, improving model efficiency by using sparsified soft shapes as inputs. Specifically, we employ a learnable router to activate a subset of class-specific expert networks for intra-shape pattern learning. Meanwhile, a shared expert network learns inter-shape patterns by converting sparsified shapes into sequences. Extensive experiments show that SoftShape outperforms state-of-the-art methods and produces interpretable results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICML 2025</p></details> |

These models leverage the self-attention mechanism to capture long-term temporal or variate dependencies in sequences. Existing methods can be divided into two approaches: (1) reducing computational cost of attention by making the calculations sparse, and (2) reshaping the input data to aggregate temporal features. However, existing attention mechanisms may not adequately capture inherent nonlinear dependencies present in time series data, leaving room for improvement. In this study, we propose a novel attention mechanism based on Chatterjee's rank correlation coefficient, which measures nonlinear dependencies between variables. Specifically, we replace the matrix multiplication in standard attention mechanisms with this rank coefficient to measure the query-key relationship. Since computing Chatterjee's correlation coefficient involves sorting and ranking operations, we introduce a differentiable approximation employing SoftSort and SoftRank. Our proposed mechanism, ``XicorAttention,'' integrates it into several state-of-the-art Transformer models. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that incorporating nonlinear correlation into the attention improves forecasting accuracy by up to approximately 9.1\% compared to existing models.</p></details> |  |

However, rapid changes in land surface dynamics necessitate frequent updates, quickly rendering previously collected samples obsolete and imposing significant labor demands for continuous manual updates. In this study, we aim to address this problem by dynamic sample generation using existing single-date static labeled samples. We introduce TasGen, a two-stage automated framework to automatically generate dynamic samples, designed to simultaneously model spectral and temporal dependencies in time-series remote sensing imagery via temporal-spectral embedding, capturing land surface changes without additional manual annotations.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing approaches struggle to fully capture the complex and structured dependencies inherent in time series data. In this work, we identify and formally define three critical dependencies that are fundamental to forecasting accuracy: order dependency and semantic dependency along the temporal dimension, as well as cross-variate dependency across the feature dimension. These dependencies are often treated in isolation, and improper handling can introduce noise and degrade forecasting performance. To bridge this gap, we investigate the potential of State Space Models (SSMs) for LTSF and emphasize their inherent advantages in capturing these essential dependencies. Additionally, we empirically observe that excessive nonlinearity in conventional SSMs introduce redundancy when applied to semantically sparse time series data. Motivated by this insight, we propose SDE (Simplified and Disentangled Dependency Encoding), a novel framework designed to enhance the capability of SSMs for LTSF. Specifically, we first eliminate unnecessary nonlinearities in vanilla SSMs, thereby improving the suitability for time series forecasting. Building on this foundation, we introduce a disentangled encoding strategy, which empowers SSMs to efficiently model cross-variate dependencies while mitigating interference between the temporal and feature dimensions. Furthermore, we provide rigorous theoretical justifications to substantiate our design choices. Extensive experiments on nine real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that SDE-enhanced SSMs consistently outperform state-of-the-art time series forecasting models.Our code is available at https://github.com/YukinoAsuna/SAMBA.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

Forecasting them is important in multiple fields, including investing and econometrics. While statistical and contemporary machine learning methods have been applied to many time series tasks, there is a lack of comparison of these approaches on this particularly challenging data regime. To this end, we try to bridge this gap and thoroughly evaluate the theoretical properties and practical performance of 24 deterministic and probabilistic company fundamentals forecasting models on real company data. We observe that deep learning models provide superior forecasting performance to classical models, in particular when considering uncertainty estimation. To validate the findings, we compare them to human analyst expectations and find that their accuracy is comparable to the automatic forecasts. We further show how these high-quality forecasts can benefit automated stock allocation.

Despite rigorous examination, labeling errors are inevitable and can significantly impede accurate predictions of patient outcome. To address this challenge, we propose an \textbf{A}ttention-based Learning Framework with Dynamic \textbf{C}alibration and Augmentation for \textbf{T}ime series Noisy \textbf{L}abel \textbf{L}earning (ACTLL). This framework leverages a two-component Beta mixture model to identify the certain and uncertain sets of instances based on the fitness distribution of each class, and it captures global temporal dynamics while dynamically calibrating labels from the uncertain set or augmenting confident instances from the certain set. Experimental results on large-scale EHR datasets eICU and MIMIC-IV-ED, and several benchmark datasets from the UCR and UEA repositories, demonstrate that our model ACTLL has achieved state-of-the-art performance, especially under high noise levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering Latent Causal Graphs from Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05331v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many important phenomena in scientific fields like climate, neuroscience, and epidemiology are naturally represented as spatiotemporal gridded data with complex interactions. Inferring causal relationships from these data is a challenging problem compounded by the high dimensionality of such data and the correlations between spatially proximate points. We present SPACY (SPAtiotemporal Causal discoverY), a novel framework based on variational inference, designed to model latent time series and their causal relationships from spatiotemporal data. SPACY alleviates the high-dimensional challenge by discovering causal structures in the latent space. To aggregate spatially proximate, correlated grid points, we use \change{spatial factors, parametrized by spatial kernel functions}, to map observational time series to latent representations. \change{Theoretically, we generalize the problem to a continuous spatial domain and establish identifiability when the observations arise from a nonlinear, invertible function of the product of latent series and spatial factors. Using this approach, we avoid assumptions that are often unverifiable, including those about instantaneous effects or sufficient variability.} Empirically, SPACY outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic data, even in challenging settings where existing methods struggle, while remaining scalable for large grids. SPACY also identifies key known phenomena from real-world climate data.</p></details> |  |

Despite its significance, IOH prediction is hindered by event sparsity and the challenge of integrating static and dynamic data across diverse patients. In this paper, we propose \textbf{IOHFuseLM}, a multimodal language model framework. To accurately identify and differentiate sparse hypotensive events, we leverage a two-stage training strategy. The first stage involves domain adaptive pretraining on IOH physiological time series augmented through diffusion methods, thereby enhancing the model sensitivity to patterns associated with hypotension. Subsequently, task fine-tuning is performed on the original clinical dataset to further enhance the ability to distinguish normotensive from hypotensive states. To enable multimodal fusion for each patient, we align structured clinical descriptions with the corresponding physiological time series at the token level. Such alignment enables the model to capture individualized temporal patterns alongside their corresponding clinical semantics. In addition, we convert static patient attributes into structured text to enrich personalized information. Experimental evaluations on two intraoperative datasets demonstrate that IOHFuseLM outperforms established baselines in accurately identifying IOH events, highlighting its applicability in clinical decision support scenarios. Our code is publicly available to promote reproducibility at https://github.com/zjt-gpu/IOHFuseLM.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness in handling complex, noisy, and multivariate time-series data remains underexplored. To address this, we propose LLMPred which enhances LLM-based time-series prediction by converting time-series sequences into text and feeding them to LLMs for zero shot prediction along with two main data pre-processing techniques. First, we apply time-series sequence decomposition to facilitate accurate prediction on complex and noisy univariate sequences. Second, we extend this univariate prediction capability to multivariate data using a lightweight prompt-processing strategy. Extensive experiments with smaller LLMs such as Llama 2 7B, Llama 3.2 3B, GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek 7B demonstrate that LLMPred achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, a thorough ablation study highlights the importance of the key components proposed in LLMPred.</p></details> |  |

Paris, France during late the spring and summer months is the major focus. Predictors and responses are drawn from the Paris-Montsouris weather station for the years 2018 through 2024. Q(.95) values are used because of interest in summer heat that is statistically rare and extreme. The data are curated as a multiple time series for each year. Predictors include seven routinely collected indicators of weather conditions. They each are lagged by 14 days such that temperature and heat index forecasts are provided two weeks in advance. Forecasting uncertainty is addressed with conformal prediction regions. Forecasting accuracy is promising. Cairo, Egypt is a second location using data from the weather station at the Cairo Internal Airport over the same years and months. Cairo is a more challenging setting for temperature forecasting because its desert climate can create abrupt and erratic temperature changes. Yet, there is some progress forecasting record-setting hot days.</p></details> | 10 figures |

However, many real-world environmental datasets, such as those collected by spacecraft monitoring the solar wind, contain gaps, which inevitably corrupt the statistics. The nature of this corruption for structure functions remains poorly understood - indeed, often overlooked. Here we simulate gaps in a large set of magnetic field intervals from Parker Solar Probe in order to characterize the behaviour of the structure function of a sparse time series of solar wind turbulence. We quantify the resultant error with regards to the overall shape of the structure function, and its slope in the inertial range. Noting the consistent underestimation of the true curve when using linear interpolation, we demonstrate the ability of an empirical correction factor to de-bias these estimates. This correction, "learnt" from the data from a single spacecraft, is shown to generalize well to data from a solar wind regime elsewhere in the heliosphere, producing smaller errors, on average, for missing fractions >25%. Given this success, we apply the correction to gap-affected Voyager intervals from the inner heliosheath and local interstellar medium, obtaining spectral indices similar to those from previous studies.

Many real-life scenarios, such as public health, economics, and social applications, involve feedback loops where predictions can influence the predicted outcome, subsequently altering the target variable's distribution. This phenomenon, known as performativity, introduces the potential for 'self-negating' or 'self-fulfilling' predictions. Despite extensive studies in classification problems across domains, performativity remains largely unexplored in the context of time-series forecasting from a machine-learning perspective. In this paper, we formalize performative time-series forecasting (PeTS), addressing the challenge of accurate predictions when performativity-induced distribution shifts are possible. We propose a novel approach, Feature Performative-Shifting (FPS), which leverages the concept of delayed response to anticipate distribution shifts and subsequently predicts targets accordingly. We provide theoretical insights suggesting that FPS can potentially lead to reduced generalization error. We conduct comprehensive experiments using multiple time-series models on COVID-19 and traffic forecasting tasks. The results demonstrate that FPS consistently outperforms conventional time-series forecasting methods, highlighting its efficacy in handling performativity-induced challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages (8 main text, 1 reference, 3 appendix), 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Models for Tabular Data Imputation and Synthetic Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02549v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data imputation and data generation have important applications for many domains, like healthcare and finance, where incomplete or missing data can hinder accurate analysis and decision-making. Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models capable of capturing complex data distributions across various data modalities such as image, audio, and time series data. Recently, they have been also adapted to generate tabular data. In this paper, we propose a diffusion model for tabular data that introduces three key enhancements: (1) a conditioning attention mechanism, (2) an encoder-decoder transformer as the denoising network, and (3) dynamic masking. The conditioning attention mechanism is designed to improve the model's ability to capture the relationship between the condition and synthetic data. The transformer layers help model interactions within the condition (encoder) or synthetic data (decoder), while dynamic masking enables our model to efficiently handle both missing data imputation and synthetic data generation tasks within a unified framework. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation by comparing the performance of diffusion models with transformer conditioning against state-of-the-art techniques, such as Variational Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models, on benchmark datasets. Our evaluation focuses on the assessment of the generated samples with respect to three important criteria, namely: (1) Machine Learning efficiency, (2) statistical similarity, and (3) privacy risk mitigation. For the task of data imputation, we consider the efficiency of the generated samples across different levels of missing features.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

| **[Early Detection of Patient Deterioration from Real-Time Wearable Monitoring System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01305v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early detection of patient deterioration is crucial for reducing mortality rates. Heart rate data has shown promise in assessing patient health, and wearable devices offer a cost-effective solution for real-time monitoring. However, extracting meaningful insights from diverse heart rate data and handling missing values in wearable device data remain key challenges. To address these challenges, we propose TARL, an innovative approach that models the structural relationships of representative subsequences, known as shapelets, in heart rate time series. TARL creates a shapelet-transition knowledge graph to model shapelet dynamics in heart rate time series, indicating illness progression and potential future changes. We further introduce a transition-aware knowledge embedding to reinforce relationships among shapelets and quantify the impact of missing values, enabling the formulation of comprehensive heart rate representations. These representations capture explanatory structures and predict future heart rate trends, aiding early illness detection. We collaborate with physicians and nurses to gather ICU patient heart rate data from wearables and diagnostic metrics assessing illness severity for evaluating deterioration. Experiments on real-world ICU data demonstrate that TARL achieves both high reliability and early detection. A case study further showcases TARL's explainable detection process, highlighting its potential as an AI-driven tool to assist clinicians in recognizing early signs of patient deterioration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-time respiratory motion forecasting with online learning of recurrent neural networks for accurate targeting in externally guided radiotherapy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01607v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In lung radiotherapy, infrared cameras can track reflective objects on the chest to estimate tumor motion due to breathing, but treatment system latencies hinder radiation beam precision. Real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) is a potential solution that can learn patterns within non-stationary respiratory data but has high complexity. This study assesses the capabilities of resource-efficient online RNN algorithms, namely unbiased online recurrent optimization (UORO), sparse-1 step approximation (SnAp-1), and decoupled neural interfaces (DNI) to forecast respiratory motion during radiotherapy treatment accurately. We use time series containing the 3D positions of external markers on the chest of healthy subjects. We propose efficient implementations for SnAp-1 and DNI that compress the influence and immediate Jacobian matrices and accurately update the linear coefficients used in credit assignment estimation, respectively. Data was originally sampled at 10Hz; we resampled it at 3.33Hz and 30Hz to analyze the effect of the sampling rate on performance. We use UORO, SnAp-1, and DNI to forecast each marker's 3D position with horizons h<=2.1s (the time interval in advance for which the prediction is made) and compare them with RTRL, least mean squares, kernel support vector regression, and linear regression. RNNs trained online achieved similar or better accuracy than most previous works using larger training databases and deep learning, even though we used only the first minute of each sequence to predict motion within that exact sequence. SnAp-1 had the lowest normalized root mean square errors (nRMSEs) averaged over the horizon values considered, equal to 0.335 and 0.157, at 3.33Hz and 10.0Hz, respectively. Similarly, UORO had the lowest nRMSE at 30Hz, equal to 0.086. DNI's inference time (6.8ms per time step at 30Hz, Intel Core i7-13700 CPU) was the lowest among the RNN methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 18 figures, accepted manuscript version</p></details> |
| **[Stock Market Telepathy: Graph Neural Networks Predicting the Secret Conversations between MINT and G7 Countries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01945v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emerging economies, particularly the MINT countries (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria, and T\"urkiye), are gaining influence in global stock markets, although they remain susceptible to the economic conditions of developed countries like the G7 (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States). This interconnectedness and sensitivity of financial markets make understanding these relationships crucial for investors and policymakers to predict stock price movements accurately. To this end, we examined the main stock market indices of G7 and MINT countries from 2012 to 2024, using a recent graph neural network (GNN) algorithm called multivariate time series forecasting with graph neural network (MTGNN). This method allows for considering complex spatio-temporal connections in multivariate time series. In the implementations, MTGNN revealed that the US and Canada are the most influential G7 countries regarding stock indices in the forecasting process, and Indonesia and T\"urkiye are the most influential MINT countries. Additionally, our results showed that MTGNN outperformed traditional methods in forecasting the prices of stock market indices for MINT and G7 countries. Consequently, the study offers valuable insights into economic blocks' markets and presents a compelling empirical approach to analyzing global stock market dynamics using MTGNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trojan Horse Hunt in Time Series Forecasting for Space Operations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01849v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This competition hosted on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/trojan-horse-hunt-in-space) is the first part of a series of follow-up competitions and hackathons related to the "Assurance for Space Domain AI Applications" project funded by the European Space Agency (https://assurance-ai.space-codev.org/). The competition idea is based on one of the real-life AI security threats identified within the project -- the adversarial poisoning of continuously fine-tuned satellite telemetry forecasting models. The task is to develop methods for finding and reconstructing triggers (trojans) in advanced models for satellite telemetry forecasting used in safety-critical space operations. Participants are provided with 1) a large public dataset of real-life multivariate satellite telemetry (without triggers), 2) a reference model trained on the clean data, 3) a set of poisoned neural hierarchical interpolation (N-HiTS) models for time series forecasting trained on the dataset with injected triggers, and 4) Jupyter notebook with the training pipeline and baseline algorithm (the latter will be published in the last month of the competition). The main task of the competition is to reconstruct a set of 45 triggers (i.e., short multivariate time series segments) injected into the training data of the corresponding set of 45 poisoned models. The exact characteristics (i.e., shape, amplitude, and duration) of these triggers must be identified by participants. The popular Neural Cleanse method is adopted as a baseline, but it is not designed for time series analysis and new approaches are necessary for the task. The impact of the competition is not limited to the space domain, but also to many other safety-critical applications of advanced time series analysis where model poisoning may lead to serious consequences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ergodic Network Stochastic Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17779v3)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework for Network Stochastic Differential Equations (N-SDE), where each node in a network is governed by an SDE influenced by interactions with its neighbors. The evolution of each node is driven by the interplay of three key components: the node's intrinsic dynamics (\emph{momentum effect}), feedback from neighboring nodes (\emph{network effect}), and a \emph{stochastic volatility} term modeled by Brownian motion. Our primary objective is to estimate the parameters of the N-SDE system from high-frequency discrete-time observations. The motivation behind this model lies in its ability to analyze very high-dimensional time series by leveraging the inherent sparsity of the underlying network graph. We consider two distinct scenarios: \textit{i) known network structure}: the graph is fully specified, and we establish conditions under which the parameters can be identified, considering the linear growth of the parameter space with the number of edges. \textit{ii) unknown network structure}: the graph must be inferred from the data. For this, we develop an iterative procedure using adaptive Lasso, tailored to a specific subclass of N-SDE models. In this work, we assume the network graph is oriented, paving the way for novel applications of SDEs in causal inference, enabling the study of cause-effect relationships in dynamic systems. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate the performance of our estimators across various graph topologies in high-dimensional settings. We also showcase the framework's applicability to real-world datasets, highlighting its potential for advancing the analysis of complex networked systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Gaussian Mixture Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01780v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces FedGenGMM, a novel one-shot federated learning approach for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) tailored for unsupervised learning scenarios. In federated learning (FL), where multiple decentralized clients collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, significant challenges include statistical heterogeneity, high communication costs, and privacy concerns. FedGenGMM addresses these issues by allowing local GMM models, trained independently on client devices, to be aggregated through a single communication round. This approach leverages the generative property of GMMs, enabling the creation of a synthetic dataset on the server side to train a global model efficiently. Evaluation across diverse datasets covering image, tabular, and time series data demonstrates that FedGenGMM consistently achieves performance comparable to non-federated and iterative federated methods, even under significant data heterogeneity. Additionally, FedGenGMM significantly reduces communication overhead, maintains robust performance in anomaly detection tasks, and offers flexibility in local model complexities, making it particularly suitable for edge computing environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Data Augmentation for Time-Series Classification: An Extensive Empirical Study and Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10060v7)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data Augmentation (DA) has become a critical approach in Time Series Classification (TSC), primarily for its capacity to expand training datasets, enhance model robustness, introduce diversity, and reduce overfitting. However, the current landscape of DA in TSC is plagued with fragmented literature reviews, nebulous methodological taxonomies, inadequate evaluative measures, and a dearth of accessible and user-oriented tools. This study addresses these challenges through a comprehensive examination of DA methodologies within the TSC domain.Our research began with an extensive literature review spanning a decade, revealing significant gaps in existing surveys and necessitating a detailed analysis of over 100 scholarly articles to identify more than 60 distinct DA techniques. This rigorous review led to the development of a novel taxonomy tailored to the specific needs of DA in TSC, categorizing techniques into five primary categories: Transformation-Based, Pattern-Based, Generative, Decomposition-Based, and Automated Data Augmentation. This taxonomy is intended to guide researchers in selecting appropriate methods with greater clarity. In response to the lack of comprehensive evaluations of foundational DA techniques, we conducted a thorough empirical study, testing nearly 20 DA strategies across 15 diverse datasets representing all types within the UCR time-series repository. Using ResNet and LSTM architectures, we employed a multifaceted evaluation approach, including metrics such as Accuracy, Method Ranking, and Residual Analysis, resulting in a benchmark accuracy of 84.98 +- 16.41% in ResNet and 82.41 +- 18.71% in LSTM. Our investigation underscored the inconsistent efficacies of DA techniques, for instance, methods like RGWs and Random Permutation significantly improved model performance, whereas others, like EMD, were less effective.</p></details> |  |

Such characteristics align closely with the demands of ubiquitous computing systems, which often operate on resource-constrained devices while continuously monitoring and processing time-series sensor data. Despite their unique and promising features, SNNs have received limited attention and remain underexplored (or at least, under-adopted) within the ubiquitous computing community. To address this gap, this paper first introduces the core components of SNNs, both in terms of models and training mechanisms. It then presents a systematic survey of 76 SNN-based studies focused on time-series data analysis, categorizing them into six key application domains. For each domain, we summarize relevant works and subsequent advancements, distill core insights, and highlight key takeaways for researchers and practitioners. To facilitate hands-on experimentation, we also provide a comprehensive review of current software frameworks and neuromorphic hardware platforms, detailing their capabilities and specifications, and then offering tailored recommendations for selecting development tools based on specific application needs. Finally, we identify prevailing challenges within each application domain and propose future research directions that need be explored in ubiquitous community. Our survey highlights the transformative potential of SNNs in enabling energy-efficient ubiquitous sensing across diverse application domains, while also serving as an essential introduction for researchers looking to enter this emerging field.</p></details> | 50 pages |

These methods learn the parameters of parametric policies via stochastic gradient ascent, typically using on-policy trajectory data to estimate the policy gradient. However, such reliance on fresh data makes them sample-inefficient. Indeed, vanilla PG methods require $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ trajectories to reach an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point. A common strategy to improve efficiency is to reuse off-policy information from past iterations, such as previous gradients or trajectories. While gradient reuse has received substantial theoretical attention, leading to improved rates of $O(\epsilon^{-3/2})$, the reuse of past trajectories remains largely unexplored from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we provide the first rigorous theoretical evidence that extensive reuse of past off-policy trajectories can significantly accelerate convergence in PG methods. We introduce a power mean correction to the multiple importance weighting estimator and propose RPG (Retrospective Policy Gradient), a PG algorithm that combines old and new trajectories for policy updates. Through a novel analysis, we show that, under established assumptions, RPG achieves a sample complexity of $\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$, the best known rate in the literature. We further validate empirically our approach against PG methods with state-of-the-art rates.</p></details> |  |

To provide an optimized solution, we propose a cooperative trajectory optimization and task allocation framework leveraging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). This study integrates a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for efficient task allocation among multiple UAVs and UGVs, and employs an informed-RRT* (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star) algorithm for collision-free trajectory generation. Further optimization of task sequencing and path efficiency is conducted using Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). Simulation experiments conducted in a realistic post-disaster environment demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly improves the overall efficiency of medical rescue operations compared to traditional strategies, showing substantial reductions in total mission completion time and traveled distance. Additionally, the cooperative utilization of UAVs and UGVs effectively balances their complementary advantages, highlighting the system' s scalability and practicality for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multidimensional Adaptive Coefficient for Inference Trajectory Optimization in Flow and Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14161v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow and diffusion models have demonstrated strong performance and training stability across various tasks but lack two critical properties of simulation-based methods: freedom of dimensionality and adaptability to different inference trajectories. To address this limitation, we propose the Multidimensional Adaptive Coefficient (MAC), a plug-in module for flow and diffusion models that extends conventional unidimensional coefficients to multidimensional ones and enables inference trajectory-wise adaptation. MAC is trained via simulation-based feedback through adversarial refinement. Empirical results across diverse frameworks and datasets demonstrate that MAC enhances generative quality with high training efficiency. Consequently, our work offers a new perspective on inference trajectory optimality, encouraging future research to move beyond vector field design and to leverage training-efficient, simulation-based optimization.</p></details> | ICML 2025 Paper |
| **[Trajectory Optimization for UAV-Based Medical Delivery with Temporal Logic Constraints and Convex Feasible Set Collision Avoidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06038v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of trajectory optimization for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) performing time-sensitive medical deliveries in urban environments. Specifically, we consider a single UAV with 3 degree-of-freedom dynamics tasked with delivering blood packages to multiple hospitals, each with a predefined time window and priority. Mission objectives are encoded using Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enabling the formal specification of spatial-temporal constraints. To ensure safety, city buildings are modeled as 3D convex obstacles, and obstacle avoidance is handled through a Convex Feasible Set (CFS) method. The entire planning problem-combining UAV dynamics, STL satisfaction, and collision avoidance-is formulated as a convex optimization problem that ensures tractability and can be solved efficiently using standard convex programming techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method generates dynamically feasible, collision-free trajectories that satisfy temporal mission goals, providing a scalable and reliable approach for autonomous UAV-based medical logistics.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Enhanced Trust Region Sequential Convex Optimization for Multi-Drone Thermal Screening Trajectory Planning in Urban Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06012v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid detection of abnormal body temperatures in urban populations is essential for managing public health risks, especially during outbreaks of infectious diseases. Multi-drone thermal screening systems offer promising solutions for fast, large-scale, and non-intrusive human temperature monitoring. However, trajectory planning for multiple drones in complex urban environments poses significant challenges, including collision avoidance, coverage efficiency, and constrained flight environments. In this study, we propose an enhanced trust region sequential convex optimization (TR-SCO) algorithm for optimal trajectory planning of multiple drones performing thermal screening tasks. Our improved algorithm integrates a refined convex optimization formulation within a trust region framework, effectively balancing trajectory smoothness, obstacle avoidance, altitude constraints, and maximum screening coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves trajectory optimality and computational efficiency compared to conventional convex optimization methods. This research provides critical insights and practical contributions toward deploying efficient multi-drone systems for real-time thermal screening in urban areas.

| **[State-Covering Trajectory Stitching for Diffusion Planners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00895v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models are emerging as powerful tools for long-horizon planning in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly with offline datasets. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality and diversity of training data. This often restricts their generalization to tasks outside their training distribution or longer planning horizons. To overcome this challenge, we propose State-Covering Trajectory Stitching (SCoTS), a novel reward-free trajectory augmentation method that incrementally stitches together short trajectory segments, systematically generating diverse and extended trajectories. SCoTS first learns a temporal distance-preserving latent representation that captures the underlying temporal structure of the environment, then iteratively stitches trajectory segments guided by directional exploration and novelty to effectively cover and expand this latent space. We demonstrate that SCoTS significantly improves the performance and generalization capabilities of diffusion planners on offline goal-conditioned benchmarks requiring stitching and long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, augmented trajectories generated by SCoTS significantly improve the performance of widely used offline goal-conditioned RL algorithms across diverse environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Entropy: Modeling Game State Stability from Multimodality Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05810v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex interactions among agents present a significant challenge for autonomous driving in real-world scenarios. Recently, a promising approach has emerged, which formulates the interactions of agents as a level-k game framework. It effectively decouples agent policies by hierarchical game levels. However, this framework ignores both the varying driving complexities among agents and the dynamic changes in agent states across game levels, instead treating them uniformly. Consequently, redundant and error-prone computations are introduced into this framework. To tackle the issue, this paper proposes a metric, termed as Trajectory Entropy, to reveal the game status of agents within the level-k game framework. The key insight stems from recognizing the inherit relationship between agent policy uncertainty and the associated driving complexity. Specifically, Trajectory Entropy extracts statistical signals representing uncertainty from the multimodality trajectory prediction results of agents in the game. Then, the signal-to-noise ratio of this signal is utilized to quantify the game status of agents. Based on the proposed Trajectory Entropy, we refine the current level-k game framework through a simple gating mechanism, significantly improving overall accuracy while reducing computational costs. Our method is evaluated on the Waymo and nuPlan datasets, in terms of trajectory prediction, open-loop and closed-loop planning tasks. The results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method, with precision improved by up to 19.89% for prediction and up to 16.48% for planning.</p></details> | 10 pages |

| **[BiTrajDiff: Bidirectional Trajectory Generation with Diffusion Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05762v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we analyze the anonymized Yjmob100k dataset, which captures the trajectories of 100,000 users in Japan, and demonstrate how existing anonymization techniques fail to protect their sensitive attributes. We leverage population density patterns, structural correlations, and temporal activity profiles to re-identify the dataset's real-world location and timing. Our results reveal that the anonymization process carried out for Yjmob100k is inefficient and preserves enough spatial and temporal structure to enable re-identification. This work underscores the limitations of current trajectory anonymization methods and calls for more robust privacy mechanisms in the publication of mobility data.</p></details> |  |

It is expected to be the next-gen video technology and a prevalent use case for 5G and beyond wireless communication. Considering that each user typically only watches a section of the volumetric video, known as the viewport, it is essential to have precise viewport prediction for optimal performance. However, research on this topic is still in its infancy. In the end, this paper presents and proposes a novel approach, named Saliency and Trajectory Viewport Prediction (STVP), which aims to improve the precision of viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. The STVP extensively utilizes video saliency information and viewport trajectory. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. In particular, we introduce a novel sampling method, Uniform Random Sampling (URS), to reduce computational complexity while still preserving video features in an efficient manner. Then we present a saliency detection technique that incorporates both spatial and temporal information for detecting static, dynamic geometric, and color salient regions. Finally, we intelligently fuse saliency and trajectory information to achieve more accurate viewport prediction. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed viewport prediction methods using state-of-the-art volumetric video sequences. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method over existing schemes. The dataset and source code will be publicly accessible after acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a structured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model, EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models, while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories, inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs, lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and personalized healthcare.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a novel model predictive control (MPC) method for MS-AGV trajectory tracking that takes tire wear minimization consideration in the objective function. To speed up the problem-solving process, we propose a hierarchical controller design and simplify the dynamic model by integrating the \textit{magic formula tire model} and \textit{simplified tire wear model}. In the experiment, the proposed method can be solved by simulated annealing in real-time on a normal personal computer and by incorporating tire wear into the objective function, tire wear is reduced by 19.19\% while maintaining the tracking accuracy in curve-tracking experiments. In the more challenging scene: the desired trajectory is offset by 60 degrees from the vehicle's heading, the reduction in tire wear increased to 65.20\% compared to the kinematic model without considering the tire wear optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Journal of Automation and Intelligence</p></details> |

Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos offers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and simplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While imitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert demonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements, learning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios. To address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with Equivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models expert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the stochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual representation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a diffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and sampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization. Additionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric symmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process. To address state mismatches, we develop a forward-process guided action inference strategy for conditional sampling. Using an ESD video dataset of nearly 2000 clips, experimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, both explicit and implicit, in trajectory prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of imitation learning to surgical skill development for dissection trajectory prediction.</p></details> |  |

The proposed approach incorporates a modular architecture that integrates state estimation, vehicle dynamics modeling, and optimization to ensure real-time performance. The state-space equations are formulated in a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) form, and a curvature-based tuning method is introduced to optimize weight matrices for varying trajectories. The MPC framework is implemented using the Robot Operating System (ROS) for parallel execution of state estimation and control optimization, ensuring scalability and minimal latency. Extensive simulations and real-time experiments were conducted on multiple predefined trajectories, demonstrating high accuracy with minimal cross-track and orientation errors, even under aggressive maneuvers and high-speed conditions. The results highlight the robustness and adaptability of the proposed system, achieving seamless alignment between simulated and real-world performance. This work lays the foundation for dynamic weight tuning and integration into cooperative autonomous navigation systems, paving the way for enhanced safety and efficiency in autonomous driving applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating 6DoF Object Manipulation Trajectories from Action Description in Egocentric Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03605v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning to use tools or objects in common scenes, particularly handling them in various ways as instructed, is a key challenge for developing interactive robots. Training models to generate such manipulation trajectories requires a large and diverse collection of detailed manipulation demonstrations for various objects, which is nearly unfeasible to gather at scale. In this paper, we propose a framework that leverages large-scale ego- and exo-centric video datasets -- constructed globally with substantial effort -- of Exo-Ego4D to extract diverse manipulation trajectories at scale. From these extracted trajectories with the associated textual action description, we develop trajectory generation models based on visual and point cloud-based language models. In the recently proposed egocentric vision-based in-a-quality trajectory dataset of HOT3D, we confirmed that our models successfully generate valid object trajectories, establishing a training dataset and baseline models for the novel task of generating 6DoF manipulation trajectories from action descriptions in egocentric vision.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

In contrast to prior methods that address these motion types through separate modules or task-specific designs, our approach offers a cohesive solution by projecting user-defined trajectories into the latent space of pre-trained image-to-video generation models via a lightweight motion injector. Users can specify keypoints and their motion paths to control localized deformations, entire object motion, virtual camera dynamics, or combinations of these. The injected trajectory signals guide the generative process to produce temporally consistent and semantically aligned motion sequences. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple video motion control tasks, including stylized motion effects (e.g., motion brushes), dynamic viewpoint changes, and precise local motion manipulation. Experiments show that our method provides significantly better controllability and visual quality compared to prior approaches and commercial solutions, while remaining broadly compatible with various state-of-the-art video generation backbones.

| **[Urban Visibility Hotspots: Quantifying Building Vertex Visibility from Connected Vehicle Trajectories using Spatial Indexing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03365v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective placement of Out-of-Home advertising and street furniture requires accurate identification of locations offering maximum visual exposure to target audiences, particularly vehicular traffic. Traditional site selection methods often rely on static traffic counts or subjective assessments. This research introduces a data-driven methodology to objectively quantify location visibility by analyzing large-scale connected vehicle trajectory data (sourced from Compass IoT) within urban environments. We model the dynamic driver field-of-view using a forward-projected visibility area for each vehicle position derived from interpolated trajectories. By integrating this with building vertex locations extracted from OpenStreetMap, we quantify the cumulative visual exposure, or ``visibility count'', for thousands of potential points of interest near roadways. The analysis reveals that visibility is highly concentrated, identifying specific ``visual hotspots'' that receive disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. The core technical contribution involves the construction of a BallTree spatial index over building vertices. This enables highly efficient (O(logN) complexity) radius queries to determine which vertices fall within the viewing circles of millions of trajectory points across numerous trips, significantly outperforming brute-force geometric checks. Analysis reveals two key findings: 1) Visibility is highly concentrated, identifying distinct 'visual hotspots' receiving disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. 2) The aggregated visibility counts across vertices conform to a Log-Normal distribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Trajectory Stitching with Flow Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07802v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have shown great promise as trajectory planners, given their affinity to modeling complex distributions and guidable inference process. Previous works have successfully applied these in the context of robotic manipulation but perform poorly when the required solution does not exist as a complete trajectory within the training set. We identify that this is a result of being unable to plan via stitching, and subsequently address the architectural and dataset choices needed to remedy this. On top of this, we propose a novel addition to the training and inference procedures to both stabilize and enhance these capabilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by generating plans with out of distribution boundary conditions and performing obstacle avoidance on the Franka Panda in simulation and on real hardware. In both of these tasks our method performs significantly better than the baselines and is able to avoid obstacles up to four times as large.</p></details> |  |
| **[TO-GATE: Clarifying Questions and Summarizing Responses with Trajectory Optimization for Eliciting Human Preference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02827v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can effectively elicit human preferences through multi-turn dialogue. Complex tasks can be accomplished through iterative clarifying questions and final responses generated by an LLM acting as a questioner (STaR-GATE; Andukuri et al., 2024}). However, existing approaches based on self-taught reasoning struggle to identify optimal dialogue trajectories and avoid irrelevant questions to the tasks. To address this limitation, we propose TO-GATE, a novel framework that enhances question generation through trajectory optimization, which consists of two key components: a clarification resolver that generates optimal questioning trajectories, and a summarizer that ensures task-aligned final responses. The trajectory optimization enables the model to produce effective elicitation questions and summary responses tailored to specific tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that TO-GATE significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving a 9.32% improvement on standard preference elicitation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controllable Sequence Editing for Biological and Clinical Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03569v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional generation models for longitudinal sequences can generate new or modified trajectories given a conditioning input. While effective at generating entire sequences, these models typically lack control over the timing and scope of the edits. Most existing approaches either operate on univariate sequences or assume that the condition affects all variables and time steps. However, many scientific and clinical applications require more precise interventions, where a condition takes effect only after a specific time and influences only a subset of variables. We introduce CLEF, a controllable sequence editing model for conditional generation of immediate and delayed effects in multivariate longitudinal sequences. CLEF learns temporal concepts that encode how and when a condition alters future sequence evolution. These concepts allow CLEF to apply targeted edits to the affected time steps and variables while preserving the rest of the sequence. We evaluate CLEF on 6 datasets spanning cellular reprogramming and patient health trajectories, comparing against 9 state-of-the-art baselines. CLEF improves immediate sequence editing accuracy by up to 36.01% (MAE). Unlike prior models, CLEF enables one-step conditional generation at arbitrary future times, outperforming them in delayed sequence editing by up to 65.71% (MAE). We test CLEF under counterfactual inference assumptions and show up to 63.19% (MAE) improvement on zero-shot conditional generation of counterfactual trajectories. In a case study of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, CLEF identifies clinical interventions that generate realistic counterfactual trajectories shifted toward healthier outcomes.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method, Exploration-Boosted MC-PILCO (EB-MC-PILCO), leverages iLQR to generate informative, exploratory trajectories and initialize the policy, significantly reducing the number of required optimization steps. Experiments on the cart-pole task demonstrate that EB-MC-PILCO accelerates convergence compared to standard MC-PILCO, achieving up to $\bm{45.9\%}$ reduction in execution time when both methods solve the task in four trials. EB-MC-PILCO also maintains a $\bm{100\%}$ success rate across trials while solving the task faster, even in cases where MC-PILCO converges in fewer iterations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrast & Compress: Learning Lightweight Embeddings for Short Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02571v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to retrieve semantically and directionally similar short-range trajectories with both accuracy and efficiency is foundational for downstream applications such as motion forecasting and autonomous navigation. However, prevailing approaches often depend on computationally intensive heuristics or latent anchor representations that lack interpretability and controllability. In this work, we propose a novel framework for learning fixed-dimensional embeddings for short trajectories by leveraging a Transformer encoder trained with a contrastive triplet loss that emphasize the importance of discriminative feature spaces for trajectory data. We analyze the influence of Cosine and FFT-based similarity metrics within the contrastive learning paradigm, with a focus on capturing the nuanced directional intent that characterizes short-term maneuvers. Our empirical evaluation on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrates that embeddings shaped by Cosine similarity objectives yield superior clustering of trajectories by both semantic and directional attributes, outperforming FFT-based baselines in retrieval tasks. Notably, we show that compact Transformer architectures, even with low-dimensional embeddings (e.g., 16 dimensions, but qualitatively down to 4), achieve a compelling balance between retrieval performance (minADE, minFDE) and computational overhead, aligning with the growing demand for scalable and interpretable motion priors in real-time systems. The resulting embeddings provide a compact, semantically meaningful, and efficient representation of trajectory data, offering a robust alternative to heuristic similarity measures and paving the way for more transparent and controllable motion forecasting pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for peer review</p></details> |

The localization of point targets constitutes a fundamental problem in optical experimental mechanics, with extensive applications in various missions of UAVs. Localizing moving targets is crucial for analyzing their motion characteristics and dynamic properties. Reconstructing the trajectories of points from asynchronous cameras is a significant challenge. It encompasses two coupled sub-problems: trajectory reconstruction and camera synchronization. Present methods typically address only one of these sub-problems individually. This paper proposes a 3D trajectory reconstruction method for point targets based on asynchronous cameras, simultaneously solving both sub-problems. Firstly, we extend the trajectory intersection method to asynchronous cameras to resolve the limitation of traditional triangulation that requires camera synchronization. Secondly, we develop models for camera temporal information and target motion, based on imaging mechanisms and target dynamics characteristics. The parameters are optimized simultaneously to achieve trajectory reconstruction without accurate time parameters. Thirdly, we optimize the camera rotations alongside the camera time information and target motion parameters, using tighter and more continuous constraints on moving points. The reconstruction accuracy is significantly improved, especially when the camera rotations are inaccurate. Finally, the simulated and real-world experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method. The real-world results indicate that the proposed algorithm achieved a localization error of 112.95 m at an observation range of 15 ~ 20 km.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by Acta Mechanica Sinica</p></details> |

However, existing trajectory-based methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex robotic manipulation. This limitation arises from multi-feature entanglement in overlapping regions, which leads to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics through a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction. Each stage is modeled using the feature of the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction, thereby mitigating the drawback of multi-object feature fusion present during interaction in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency throughout the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge V2 dataset, as well as in-the-wild evaluation, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://fuxiao0719.github.io/projects/robomaster/ Code: https://github.com/KwaiVGI/RoboMaster</p></details> |
| **[Online Competitive Information Gathering for Partially Observable Trajectory Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01927v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Game-theoretic agents must make plans that optimally gather information about their opponents. These problems are modeled by partially observable stochastic games (POSGs), but planning in fully continuous POSGs is intractable without heavy offline computation or assumptions on the order of belief maintained by each player. We formulate a finite history/horizon refinement of POSGs which admits competitive information gathering behavior in trajectory space, and through a series of approximations, we present an online method for computing rational trajectory plans in these games which leverages particle-based estimations of the joint state space and performs stochastic gradient play. We also provide the necessary adjustments required to deploy this method on individual agents. The method is tested in continuous pursuit-evasion and warehouse-pickup scenarios (alongside extensions to $N > 2$ players and to more complex environments with visual and physical obstacles), demonstrating evidence of active information gathering and outperforming passive competitors.</p></details> | Accepted at RSS 2025 |

This arises because users frequently do not fully understand their own needs, while systems require precise intent definitions. Current LLM-based agents cannot effectively distinguish between linguistically complete and contextually triggerable expressions, lacking frameworks for collaborative intent formation. We present STORM, a framework modeling asymmetric information dynamics through conversations between UserLLM (full internal access) and AgentLLM (observable behavior only). STORM produces annotated corpora capturing expression trajectories and latent cognitive transitions, enabling systematic analysis of collaborative understanding development. Our contributions include: (1) formalizing asymmetric information processing in dialogue systems; (2) modeling intent formation tracking collaborative understanding evolution; and (3) evaluation metrics measuring internal cognitive improvements alongside task performance. Experiments across four language models reveal that moderate uncertainty (40-60%) can outperform complete transparency in certain scenarios, with model-specific patterns suggesting reconsideration of optimal information completeness in human-AI collaboration. These findings contribute to understanding asymmetric reasoning dynamics and inform uncertainty-calibrated dialogue system design.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 31 figures.

In this context, constrained diversity optimization has emerged as a powerful reinforcement learning (RL) framework to train a diverse set of agents in parallel. However, existing constrained-diversity RL methods often under-explore in complex tasks such as robotic manipulation, leading to a lack in policy diversity. To improve diversity optimization in RL, we therefore propose a curriculum that first explores at the trajectory level before learning step-based policies. In our empirical evaluation, we provide novel insights into the shortcoming of skill-based diversity optimization, and demonstrate empirically that our curriculum improves the diversity of the learned skills.</p></details> |  |

Despite its growing prominence, the field lacks a systematic and unified survey that consolidates essential knowledge and advancements in this domain. This paper addresses this gap by providing the first comprehensive review of the field, covering from foundational definitions to advanced methodologies. We introduce the different approaches to camera representation and present an in-depth review of available camera trajectory generation models, starting with rule-based approaches and progressing through optimization-based techniques, machine learning advancements, and hybrid methods that integrate multiple strategies. Additionally, we gather and analyze the metrics and datasets commonly used for evaluating camera trajectory systems, offering insights into how these tools measure performance, aesthetic quality, and practical applicability. Finally, we highlight existing limitations, critical gaps in current research, and promising opportunities for investment and innovation in the field. This paper not only serves as a foundational resource for researchers entering the field but also paves the way for advancing adaptive, efficient, and creative camera trajectory systems across diverse applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Predicting Any Human Trajectory In Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00871v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting accurate future trajectories of pedestrians is essential for autonomous systems but remains a challenging task due to the need for adaptability in different environments and domains. A common approach involves collecting scenario-specific data and performing fine-tuning via backpropagation. However, this process is often impractical on edge devices due to constrained computational resources. To address this challenge, we introduce TrajICL, an In-Context Learning (ICL) framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction that enables rapid adaptation without fine-tuning on the scenario-specific data. We propose a spatio-temporal similarity-based example selection (STES) method that selects relevant examples from previously observed trajectories within the same scene by identifying similar motion patterns at corresponding locations. To further refine this selection, we introduce prediction-guided example selection (PG-ES), which selects examples based on both the past trajectory and the predicted future trajectory, rather than relying solely on the past trajectory. This approach allows the model to account for long-term dynamics when selecting examples. Finally, instead of relying on small real-world datasets with limited scenario diversity, we train our model on a large-scale synthetic dataset to enhance its prediction ability by leveraging in-context examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrajICL achieves remarkable adaptation across both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, outperforming even fine-tuned approaches across multiple public benchmarks. The code will be released at https://fujiry0.github.io/TrajICL-project-page.</p></details> |  |

This issue, often manifesting as hallucinations or unattributable reasoning processes, limits their applicability in complex reasoning scenarios. To address this, we propose Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning Attribution and Chain Explanation Supervision (KG-TRACES), a novel framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs through explicit supervision over reasoning paths and processes. KG-TRACES jointly supervises the model to: (1) predict symbolic relation paths, (2) predict full triple-level reasoning paths, and (3) generate attribution-aware reasoning processes grounded in the reasoning paths. At inference phase, the model adapts to both KG-available and KG-unavailable scenarios, retrieving reasoning paths from a KG when possible or predicting plausible reasoning paths with only intrinsic knowledge when not. This design enables the model to reason in an explainable and source-attributable pattern. Through extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that KG-TRACES significantly outperforms existing SOTA: it improves Hits@1 by 1.6% and F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and achieves improvements of 4.8% in Hits@1 and 2.1% in F1 on CWQ. Moreover, we show its transferability to specialized domains such as medicine. By visualizing the intermediate steps of reasoning processes, we further show that the explicit supervision introduced by KG-TRACES leads to more stable and goal-directed reasoning processes, aligning closely with correct answers.

Numerous methods have been proposed to address specific problems within trajectory modeling.

As time progresses, the amount of data fitted by the AD model expands, which helps to improve the AD model generalization substantially. However, such ever-expanding data is a double-edged sword for the AD model. Specifically, as the fitted data volume grows to exceed the the AD model's fitting capacities, the AD model is prone to under-fitting. To address this issue, we propose to use a pretrained Large Vision Models (LVMs) as backbone coupled with downstream perception head to understand AD semantic information. This design can not only surmount the aforementioned under-fitting problem due to LVMs' powerful fitting capabilities, but also enhance the perception generalization thanks to LVMs' vast and diverse training data. On the other hand, to mitigate vehicles' computational burden of training the perception head while running LVM backbone, we introduce a Posterior Optimization Trajectory (POT)-Guided optimization scheme (POTGui) to accelerate the convergence. Concretely, we propose a POT Generator (POTGen) to generate posterior (future) optimization direction in advance to guide the current optimization iteration, through which the model can generally converge within 10 epochs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance by over 66.48\% and converges faster over 6 times, compared to the existing state-of-the-art approach.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Rule-based planners are efficient but lack generalization, while learning-based planners excel in generalization yet have limitations in real-time performance and interpretability. In long-tail scenarios, these challenges make planning particularly difficult. To leverage the strengths of both rule-based and learning-based planners, we proposed the Scenario-Aware Hybrid Planner (SAH-Drive) for closed-loop vehicle trajectory planning. Inspired by human driving behavior, SAH-Drive combines a lightweight rule-based planner and a comprehensive learning-based planner, utilizing a dual-timescale decision neuron to determine the final trajectory. To enhance the computational efficiency and robustness of the hybrid planner, we also employed a diffusion proposal number regulator and a trajectory fusion module. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves the generalization capability of the planning system, achieving state-of-the-art performance in interPlan, while maintaining computational efficiency without incurring substantial additional runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, International Conference on Machine Learning</p></details> |

While open-source LMM agents have made significant advances in offline evaluation benchmarks, their performance still falls substantially short of human-level capabilities in more realistic online settings. A key bottleneck is the lack of diverse and large-scale trajectory-level datasets across various domains, which are expensive to collect. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a scalable recipe to synthesize the largest and most diverse trajectory-level dataset to date, containing over 94K successful multimodal web trajectories, spanning 49K unique URLs, 720K screenshots, and 33M web elements. In particular, we leverage extensive web exploration and refinement to obtain diverse task intents. The average cost is 28 cents per successful trajectory, making it affordable to a wide range of users in the community. Leveraging this dataset, we train Explorer, a multimodal web agent, and demonstrate strong performance on both offline and online web agent benchmarks such as Mind2Web-Live, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and MiniWob++. Additionally, our experiments highlight data scaling as a key driver for improving web agent capabilities. We hope this study makes state-of-the-art LMM-based agent research at a larger scale more accessible.</p></details> | ACL 2025 (Findings) |

Modeling hand-object interaction priors holds significant potential to advance robotic and embodied AI systems in learning to operate effectively within the physical world. We introduce SIGHT, a novel task focused on generating realistic and physically plausible 3D hand-object interaction trajectories from a single image and a brief language-based task description. Prior work on hand-object trajectory generation typically relies on textual input that lacks explicit grounding to the target object, or assumes access to 3D object meshes, which are often considerably more difficult to obtain than 2D images. We propose SIGHT-Fusion, a novel diffusion-based image-text conditioned generative model that tackles this task by retrieving the most similar 3D object mesh from a database and enforcing geometric hand-object interaction constraints via a novel inference-time diffusion guidance. We benchmark our model on the HOI4D and H2O datasets, adapting relevant baselines for this novel task. Experiments demonstrate our superior performance in the diversity and quality of generated trajectories, as well as in hand-object interaction geometry metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Trajectory, One Token: Grounded Video Tokenization via Panoptic Sub-object Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23617v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective video tokenization is critical for scaling transformer models for long videos. Current approaches tokenize videos using space-time patches, leading to excessive tokens and computational inefficiencies. The best token reduction strategies degrade performance and barely reduce the number of tokens when the camera moves. We introduce grounded video tokenization, a paradigm that organizes tokens based on panoptic sub-object trajectories rather than fixed patches. Our method aligns with fundamental perceptual principles, ensuring that tokenization reflects scene complexity rather than video duration. We propose TrajViT, a video encoder that extracts object trajectories and converts them into semantically meaningful tokens, significantly reducing redundancy while maintaining temporal coherence. Trained with contrastive learning, TrajViT significantly outperforms space-time ViT (ViT3D) across multiple video understanding benchmarks, e.g., TrajViT outperforms ViT3D by a large margin of 6% top-5 recall in average at video-text retrieval task with 10x token deduction. We also show TrajViT as a stronger model than ViT3D for being the video encoder for modern VideoLLM, obtaining an average of 5.2% performance improvement across 6 VideoQA benchmarks while having 4x faster training time and 18x less inference FLOPs. TrajViT is the first efficient encoder to consistently outperform ViT3D across diverse video analysis tasks, making it a robust and scalable solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autoregressive Meta-Actions for Unified Controllable Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23612v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable trajectory generation guided by high-level semantic decisions, termed meta-actions, is crucial for autonomous driving systems. A significant limitation of existing frameworks is their reliance on invariant meta-actions assigned over fixed future time intervals, causing temporal misalignment with the actual behavior trajectories. This misalignment leads to irrelevant associations between the prescribed meta-actions and the resulting trajectories, disrupting task coherence and limiting model performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Autoregressive Meta-Actions, an approach integrated into autoregressive trajectory generation frameworks that provides a unified and precise definition for meta-action-conditioned trajectory prediction. Specifically, We decompose traditional long-interval meta-actions into frame-level meta-actions, enabling a sequential interplay between autoregressive meta-action prediction and meta-action-conditioned trajectory generation. This decomposition ensures strict alignment between each trajectory segment and its corresponding meta-action, achieving a consistent and unified task formulation across the entire trajectory span and significantly reducing complexity. Moreover, we propose a staged pre-training process to decouple the learning of basic motion dynamics from the integration of high-level decision control, which offers flexibility, stability, and modularity. Experimental results validate our framework's effectiveness, demonstrating improved trajectory adaptivity and responsiveness to dynamic decision-making scenarios. We provide the video document and dataset, which are available at https://arma-traj.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

Existing work primarily focuses on behavior cloning from expert demonstrations or preference learning through exploratory trajectory sampling. However, these methods often struggle to address long-horizon tasks, where suboptimal actions accumulate step by step, causing agents to deviate from correct task trajectories. To address this, we highlight the importance of timely calibration and the need to automatically construct calibration trajectories for training agents. We propose Step-Level Trajectory Calibration (STeCa), a novel framework for LLM agent learning. Specifically, STeCa identifies suboptimal actions through a step-level reward comparison during exploration. It constructs calibrated trajectories using LLM-driven reflection, enabling agents to learn from improved decision-making processes. We finally leverage these calibrated trajectories with successful trajectories for reinforced training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STeCa significantly outperforms existing methods. Further analysis highlights that timely calibration enables agents to complete tasks with greater robustness. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/WangHanLinHenry/STeCa.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL2025 Findings</p></details> |

We propose a centroidal online trajectory generation and stabilization control for humanoid dynamic multi-contact motion. The proposed method features the drastic reduction of the computational cost by using preview control instead of the conventional model predictive control that considers the constraints of all sample times. By combining preview control with centroidal state feedback for robustness to disturbances and wrench distribution for satisfying contact constraints, we show that the robot can stably perform a variety of multi-contact motions through simulation experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[TRACE: Trajectory-Constrained Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23312v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models have shown unprecedented generative capability, but their ability to produce undesirable concepts (e.g.~pornographic content, sensitive identities, copyrighted styles) poses serious concerns for privacy, fairness, and safety. {Concept erasure} aims to remove or suppress specific concept information in a generative model. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TRACE (Trajectory-Constrained Attentional Concept Erasure)}, a novel method to erase targeted concepts from diffusion models while preserving overall generative quality. Our approach combines a rigorous theoretical framework, establishing formal conditions under which a concept can be provably suppressed in the diffusion process, with an effective fine-tuning procedure compatible with both conventional latent diffusion (Stable Diffusion) and emerging rectified flow models (e.g.~FLUX). We first derive a closed-form update to the model's cross-attention layers that removes hidden representations of the target concept. We then introduce a trajectory-aware finetuning objective that steers the denoising process away from the concept only in the late sampling stages, thus maintaining the model's fidelity on unrelated content. Empirically, we evaluate TRACE on multiple benchmarks used in prior concept erasure studies (object classes, celebrity faces, artistic styles, and explicit content from the I2P dataset). TRACE achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent methods such as ANT, EraseAnything, and MACE in terms of removal efficacy and output quality.</p></details> | In peer review |
| **[Universal Trajectory Optimization Framework for Differential Drive Robot Class](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07924v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential drive robots are widely used in various scenarios thanks to their straightforward principle, from household service robots to disaster response field robots. There are several types of driving mechanisms for real-world applications, including two-wheeled, four-wheeled skid-steering, tracked robots, and so on. The differences in the driving mechanisms usually require specific kinematic modeling when precise control is desired. Furthermore, the nonholonomic dynamics and possible lateral slip lead to different degrees of difficulty in getting feasible and high-quality trajectories. Therefore, a comprehensive trajectory optimization framework to compute trajectories efficiently for various kinds of differential drive robots is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a universal trajectory optimization framework that can be applied to differential drive robots, enabling the generation of high-quality trajectories within a restricted computational timeframe. We introduce a novel trajectory representation based on polynomial parameterization of motion states or their integrals, such as angular and linear velocities, which inherently matches the robots' motion to the control principle. The trajectory optimization problem is formulated to minimize complexity while prioritizing safety and operational efficiency. We then build a full-stack autonomous planning and control system to demonstrate its feasibility and robustness. We conduct extensive simulations and real-world testing in crowded environments with three kinds of differential drive robots to validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 15 pages, 16 figures |

In this paper, we leverage ideas from generative modeling of image data to push the boundary of time series generation. For this, we find new generators of SDEs and jump processes, inspired by trajectory flow matching, that have the marginal distributions of the time series of interest. Specifically, we can handle discontinuities of the underlying processes by parameterizing the jump kernel densities by scaled Gaussians that allow for closed form formulas of the corresponding Kullback-Leibler divergence in the loss. Unlike most other approaches, we are able to handle irregularly sampled time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlowAlign: Trajectory-Regularized, Inversion-Free Flow-based Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23145v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent inversion-free, flow-based image editing methods such as FlowEdit leverages a pre-trained noise-to-image flow model such as Stable Diffusion 3, enabling text-driven manipulation by solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE). While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source consistency. To address this limitation, we propose FlowAlign, a novel inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with principled trajectory control. FlowAlign introduces a flow-matching loss as a regularization mechanism to promote smoother and more stable trajectories during the editing process. Notably, the flow-matching loss is shown to explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory, highlighting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods in both source preservation and editing controllability.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProDiff: Prototype-Guided Diffusion for Minimal Information Trajectory Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23048v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory data is crucial for various applications but often suffers from incompleteness due to device limitations and diverse collection scenarios. Existing imputation methods rely on sparse trajectory or travel information, such as velocity, to infer missing points. However, these approaches assume that sparse trajectories retain essential behavioral patterns, which place significant demands on data acquisition and overlook the potential of large-scale human trajectory embeddings. To address this, we propose ProDiff, a trajectory imputation framework that uses only two endpoints as minimal information. It integrates prototype learning to embed human movement patterns and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model for robust spatiotemporal reconstruction. Joint training with a tailored loss function ensures effective imputation. ProDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving accuracy by 6.28\% on FourSquare and 2.52\% on WuXi. Further analysis shows a 0.927 correlation between generated and real trajectories, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Trajectory-Independent Model-Based Reconstruction Algorithm for Multi-Dimensional Magnetic Particle Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22797v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a promising tomographic technique for visualizing the spatio-temporal distribution of superparamagnetic nanoparticles, with applications ranging from cancer detection to real-time cardiovascular monitoring. Traditional MPI reconstruction relies on either time-consuming calibration (measured system matrix) or model-based simulation of the forward operator. Recent developments have shown the applicability of Chebyshev polynomials to multi-dimensional Lissajous Field-Free Point (FFP) scans. This method is bound to the particular choice of sinusoidal scanning trajectories. In this paper, we present the first reconstruction on real 2D MPI data with a trajectory-independent model-based MPI reconstruction algorithm. We further develop the zero-shot Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithm of the authors -- with automatic noise level estimation -- to address the present deconvolution problem, leveraging a state-of-the-art denoiser trained on natural images without retraining on MPI-specific data. We evaluate our method on the publicly available 2D FFP MPI dataset ``MPIdata: Equilibrium Model with Anisotropy", featuring scans of six phantoms acquired using a Bruker preclinical scanner. Moreover, we show reconstruction performed on custom data on a 2D scanner with additional high-frequency excitation field and partial data. Our results demonstrate strong reconstruction capabilities across different scanning scenarios -- setting a precedent for general-purpose, flexible model-based MPI reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Nonlinear second-order dynamics describe labial constriction trajectories across languages and contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08351v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the dynamics of labial constriction trajectories during the production of /b/ and /m/ in English and Mandarin. We find that, across languages and contexts, the ratio of instantaneous displacement to instantaneous velocity generally follows an exponential decay curve from movement onset to movement offset. We formalize this empirical discovery in a differential equation and, in combination with an assumption of point attractor dynamics, derive a nonlinear second-order dynamical system describing labial constriction trajectories. The equation has only two parameters, T and r. T corresponds to the target state and r corresponds to movement rapidity. Thus, each of the parameters corresponds to a phonetically relevant dimension of control. Nonlinear regression demonstrates that the model provides excellent fits to individual movement trajectories. Moreover, trajectories simulated from the model qualitatively match empirical trajectories, and capture key kinematic variables like duration, peak velocity, and time to achieve peak velocity. The model constitutes a proposal for the dynamics of individual articulatory movements, and thus offers a novel foundation from which to understand additional influences on articulatory kinematics like prosody, inter-movement coordination, and stochastic noise.</p></details> |  |

However, this approach remains primarily acoustic and lacks articulatory constraints. In this study, the same 75 VCVs are analyzed, but generated with the Maeda model, using trajectory planning that differentiates vowel-to-vowel transitions from consonantal influences. Synthetic data exhibit similar characteristics to Ohman's sequences, including the presence of S-shaped F2 trajectories. Furthermore, locus equations (LEs) for F2 and F3 are computed from synthetic CV data to investigate their underlying determinism, leading to a reassessment of conventional interpretations. The findings indicate that, although articulatory planning is structured separately for vowel and consonant groups, S-shaped F2 trajectories emerge from a composite mechanism governed by the coordinated synergy of all articulators.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

This study categorizes such misalignments into three types: (1) lack of functions to express intent, (2) inefficient action sequences, and (3) incorrect intentions that cannot solve the task. To address these issues, we first formalize and define these three misalignment types in a unified framework. We then propose a heuristic algorithm to detect misalignments in ARCTraj trajectories and analyze their impact hierarchically and quantitatively. We also present an intention estimation method based on our formalism that infers missing alignment between user actions and intentions. Through trajectory alignment, we experimentally demonstrate that AI models trained on human task-solving trajectories improve performance in mimicking human reasoning. Based on hierarchical analysis and experiments, we highlight the importance of trajectory-intention alignment and demonstrate the effectiveness of intention-aligned training.</p></details> | KDD 2025 accepted |
| **[Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer for Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction in the Crash Scenario](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16349v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction methods have been widely applied in autonomous driving technologies. Although the overall performance accuracy of trajectory prediction is relatively high, the lack of trajectory data in critical scenarios in the training data leads to the long-tail phenomenon. Normally, the trajectories of the tail data are more critical and more difficult to predict and may include rare scenarios such as crashes. To solve this problem, we extracted the trajectory data from real-world crash scenarios, which contain more long-tail data. Meanwhile, based on the trajectory data in this scenario, we integrated graph-based risk information and diffusion with transformer and proposed the Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer (RI-DiT) trajectory prediction method. Extensive experiments were conducted on trajectory data in the real-world crash scenario, and the results show that the algorithm we proposed has good performance. When predicting the data of the tail 10\% (Top 10\%), the minADE and minFDE indicators are 0.016/2.667 m. At the same time, we showed the trajectory conditions of different long-tail distributions. The distribution of trajectory data is closer to the tail, the less smooth the trajectory is. Through the trajectory data in real-world crash scenarios, Our work expands the methods to overcome the long-tail challenges in trajectory prediction. Our method, RI-DiT, integrates inverse time to collision (ITTC) and the feature of traffic flow, which can predict long-tail trajectories more accurately and improve the safety of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoMaPOI: A Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework for Next POI Prediction Bridging the Gap Between Trajectory and Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23837v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for the next Point-Of-Interest (POI) prediction task, leveraging their capabilities in semantic understanding of POI trajectories. However, previous LLM-based methods, which are superficially adapted to next POI prediction, largely overlook critical challenges associated with applying LLMs to this task. Specifically, LLMs encounter two critical challenges: (1) a lack of intrinsic understanding of numeric spatiotemporal data, which hinders accurate modeling of users' spatiotemporal distributions and preferences; and (2) an excessively large and unconstrained candidate POI space, which often results in random or irrelevant predictions. To address these issues, we propose a Collaborative Multi Agent Framework for Next POI Prediction, named CoMaPOI. Through the close interaction of three specialized agents (Profiler, Forecaster, and Predictor), CoMaPOI collaboratively addresses the two critical challenges. The Profiler agent is responsible for converting numeric data into language descriptions, enhancing semantic understanding. The Forecaster agent focuses on dynamically constraining and refining the candidate POI space. The Predictor agent integrates this information to generate high-precision predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (NYC, TKY, and CA) demonstrate that CoMaPOI achieves state of the art performance, improving all metrics by 5% to 10% compared to SOTA baselines. This work pioneers the investigation of challenges associated with applying LLMs to complex spatiotemporal tasks by leveraging tailored collaborative agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

Key contributions include the quantum-based state transitions, return calculation, and trajectory search mechanism that utilize quantum principles to demonstrate the realization of RL processes through quantum phenomena. The implementation emphasizes the fundamental role of quantum superposition in enhancing computational efficiency for RL tasks. Results demonstrate the capacity of a quantum model to achieve quantum enhancement in RL, highlighting the potential of fully quantum implementations in decision-making tasks. This work not only underscores the applicability of quantum computing in machine learning but also contributes to the field of quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) by offering a robust framework for understanding and exploiting quantum computing in RL systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Weight Diffusion: Generating reactive policies instead of trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14040v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing availability of open-source robotic data, imitation learning has emerged as a viable approach for both robot manipulation and locomotion. Currently, large generalized policies are trained to predict controls or trajectories using diffusion models, which have the desirable property of learning multimodal action distributions. However, generalizability comes with a cost, namely, larger model size and slower inference. This is especially an issue for robotic tasks that require high control frequency. Further, there is a known trade-off between performance and action horizon for Diffusion Policy (DP), a popular model for generating trajectories: fewer diffusion queries accumulate greater trajectory tracking errors. For these reasons, it is common practice to run these models at high inference frequency, subject to robot computational constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Weight Diffusion (LWD), a method that uses diffusion to generate closed-loop policies (weights for neural policies) for robotic tasks, rather than generating trajectories. Learning the behavior distribution through parameter space over trajectory space offers two key advantages: longer action horizons (fewer diffusion queries) & robustness to perturbations while retaining high performance; and a lower inference compute cost. To this end, we show that LWD has higher success rates than DP when the action horizon is longer and when stochastic perturbations exist in the environment. Furthermore, LWD achieves multitask performance comparable to DP while requiring just ~1/45th of the inference-time FLOPS</p></details> |  |
| **[Streaming Flow Policy: Simplifying diffusion$/$flow-matching policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21851v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion$/$flow-matching policies have enabled imitation learning of complex, multi-modal action trajectories. However, they are computationally expensive because they sample a trajectory of trajectories: a diffusion$/$flow trajectory of action trajectories. They discard intermediate action trajectories, and must wait for the sampling process to complete before any actions can be executed on the robot. We simplify diffusion$/$flow policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories. Instead of starting from pure noise, our algorithm samples from a narrow Gaussian around the last action. Then, it incrementally integrates a velocity field learned via flow matching to produce a sequence of actions that constitute a single trajectory. This enables actions to be streamed to the robot on-the-fly during the flow sampling process, and is well-suited for receding horizon policy execution. Despite streaming, our method retains the ability to model multi-modal behavior. We train flows that stabilize around demonstration trajectories to reduce distribution shift and improve imitation learning performance. Streaming flow policy outperforms prior methods while enabling faster policy execution and tighter sensorimotor loops for learning-based robot control.

However, existing learning-based planning methods often rely on expert demonstrations, which not only lack explicit safety awareness but also risk inheriting unsafe behaviors such as speeding from suboptimal human driving data. Inspired by the success of large language models, we propose Plan-R1, a novel two-stage trajectory planning framework that formulates trajectory planning as a sequential prediction task, guided by explicit planning principles such as safety, comfort, and traffic rule compliance. In the first stage, we train an autoregressive trajectory predictor via next motion token prediction on expert data. In the second stage, we design rule-based rewards (e.g., collision avoidance, speed limits) and fine-tune the model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning strategy, to align its predictions with these planning principles. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that our Plan-R1 significantly improves planning safety and feasibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be made public soon.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose IKMo, an image-keyframed motion generation method based on the diffusion model with trajectory and pose being decoupled. The trajectory and pose inputs go through a two-stage conditioning framework. In the first stage, the dedicated optimization module is applied to refine inputs. In the second stage, trajectory and pose are encoded via a Trajectory Encoder and a Pose Encoder in parallel. Then, motion with high spatial and semantic fidelity is guided by a motion ControlNet, which processes the fused trajectory and pose data. Experiment results based on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art on all metrics under trajectory-keyframe constraints. In addition, MLLM-based agents are implemented to pre-process model inputs. Given texts and keyframe images from users, the agents extract motion descriptions, keyframe poses, and trajectories as the optimized inputs into the motion generation model. We conducts a user study with 10 participants. The experiment results prove that the MLLM-based agents pre-processing makes generated motion more in line with users' expectation. We believe that the proposed method improves both the fidelity and controllability of motion generation by the diffusion model.</p></details> |  |

However, as nearly passive reflective metasurfaces, RISs may not distinguish between desired and interference signals, which can lead to severe spectrum pollution and even affect performance negatively. In particular, in large-scale networks, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the receiving node can be degraded due to excessive interference reflected from the RIS. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we propose in this paper a trajectory prediction-based dynamical control algorithm (TPC) for anticipating RIS ON-OFF states sequence, integrating a long-short-term-memory (LSTM) scheme to predict user trajectories. In particular, through a codebook-based algorithm, the RIS controller adaptively coordinates the configuration of the RIS elements to maximize the received SINR. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TPC method over various system settings.</p></details> |  |

Existing OPE methods are ineffective for high-dimensional, long-horizon problems, due to exponential blow-ups in variance from importance weighting or compounding errors from learned dynamics models. To address these challenges, we propose STITCH-OPE, a model-based generative framework that leverages denoising diffusion for long-horizon OPE in high-dimensional state and action spaces. Starting with a diffusion model pre-trained on the behavior data, STITCH-OPE generates synthetic trajectories from the target policy by guiding the denoising process using the score function of the target policy. STITCH-OPE proposes two technical innovations that make it advantageous for OPE: (1) prevents over-regularization by subtracting the score of the behavior policy during guidance, and (2) generates long-horizon trajectories by stitching partial trajectories together end-to-end. We provide a theoretical guarantee that under mild assumptions, these modifications result in an exponential reduction in variance versus long-horizon trajectory diffusion. Experiments on the D4RL and OpenAI Gym benchmarks show substantial improvement in mean squared error, correlation, and regret metrics compared to state-of-the-art OPE methods.</p></details> |  |

Facing the dual eavesdropping threats, we aim to enhance the average achievable secrecy rate for the communication user by jointly designing the UAV trajectory together with the transmit information and sensing beamforming, while satisfying the requirements on sensing performance and sensing security, as well as the UAV power and flight constraints. To address the non-convex nature of the optimization problem, we employ the alternating optimization (AO) strategy, jointly with the successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) methods. Numerical results validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its ability to achieve a high secrecy rate while meeting the required sensing and security constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, submitted for possible publication.

| **[RRO: LLM Agent Optimization Through Rising Reward Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20737v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited extraordinary performance in a variety of tasks while it remains challenging for them to solve complex multi-step tasks as agents. In practice, agents sensitive to the outcome of certain key steps which makes them likely to fail the task because of a subtle mistake in the planning trajectory. Recent approaches resort to calibrating the reasoning process through reinforcement learning. They reward or penalize every reasoning step with process supervision, as known as Process Reward Models (PRMs). However, PRMs are difficult and costly to scale up with a large number of next action candidates since they require extensive computations to acquire the training data through the per-step trajectory exploration. To mitigate this issue, we focus on the relative reward trend across successive reasoning steps and propose maintaining an increasing reward in the collected trajectories for process supervision, which we term Reward Rising Optimization (RRO). Specifically, we incrementally augment the process supervision until identifying a step exhibiting positive reward differentials, i.e. rising rewards, relative to its preceding iteration. This method dynamically expands the search space for the next action candidates, efficiently capturing high-quality data. We provide mathematical groundings and empirical results on the WebShop and InterCode-SQL benchmarks, showing that our proposed RRO achieves superior performance while requiring much less exploration cost.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Towards Human-Like Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving: A Behavior-Centric Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21565v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the trajectories of vehicles is crucial for the development of autonomous driving (AD) systems, particularly in complex and dynamic traffic environments. In this study, we introduce HiT (Human-like Trajectory Prediction), a novel model designed to enhance trajectory prediction by incorporating behavior-aware modules and dynamic centrality measures. Unlike traditional methods that primarily rely on static graph structures, HiT leverages a dynamic framework that accounts for both direct and indirect interactions among traffic participants. This allows the model to capture the subtle yet significant influences of surrounding vehicles, enabling more accurate and human-like predictions. To evaluate HiT's performance, we conducted extensive experiments using diverse and challenging real-world datasets, including NGSIM, HighD, RounD, ApolloScape, and MoCAD++. The results demonstrate that HiT consistently outperforms other top models across multiple metrics, particularly excelling in scenarios involving aggressive driving behaviors. This research presents a significant step forward in trajectory prediction, offering a more reliable and interpretable approach for enhancing the safety and efficiency of fully autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACT-R: Adaptive Camera Trajectories for Single View 3D Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08239v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the simple idea of adaptive view planning to multi-view synthesis, aiming to improve both occlusion revelation and 3D consistency for single-view 3D reconstruction. Instead of producing an unordered set of views independently or simultaneously, we generate a sequence of views, leveraging temporal consistency to enhance 3D coherence. More importantly, our view sequence is not determined by a pre-determined and fixed camera setup. Instead, we compute an adaptive camera trajectory (ACT), forming an orbit, which seeks to maximize the visibility of occluded regions of the 3D object to be reconstructed. Once the best orbit is found, we feed it to a video diffusion model to generate novel views around the orbit, which can then be passed to any multi-view 3D reconstruction model to obtain the final result. Our multi-view synthesis pipeline is quite efficient since it involves no run-time training/optimization, only forward inferences by applying pre-trained models for occlusion analysis and multi-view synthesis. Our method predicts camera trajectories that reveal occlusions effectively and produce consistent novel views, significantly improving 3D reconstruction over SOTA alternatives on the unseen GSO dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[OSVI-WM: One-Shot Visual Imitation for Unseen Tasks using World-Model-Guided Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20425v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual imitation learning enables robotic agents to acquire skills by observing expert demonstration videos. In the one-shot setting, the agent generates a policy after observing a single expert demonstration without additional fine-tuning. Existing approaches typically train and evaluate on the same set of tasks, varying only object configurations, and struggle to generalize to unseen tasks with different semantic or structural requirements. While some recent methods attempt to address this, they exhibit low success rates on hard test tasks that, despite being visually similar to some training tasks, differ in context and require distinct responses. Additionally, most existing methods lack an explicit model of environment dynamics, limiting their ability to reason about future states. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for one-shot visual imitation learning via world-model-guided trajectory generation. Given an expert demonstration video and the agent's initial observation, our method leverages a learned world model to predict a sequence of latent states and actions. This latent trajectory is then decoded into physical waypoints that guide the agent's execution. Our method is evaluated on two simulated benchmarks and three real-world robotic platforms, where it consistently outperforms prior approaches, with over 30% improvement in some cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training LLM-Based Agents with Synthetic Self-Reflected Trajectories and Partial Masking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20023v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agents, which perceive environments and take actions to achieve goals, have become increasingly feasible with the advancements in large language models (LLMs). However, current powerful agents often depend on sophisticated prompt engineering combined with closed-source LLMs like GPT-4. Although training open-source LLMs using expert trajectories from teacher models has yielded some improvements in agent capabilities, this approach still faces limitations such as performance plateauing and error propagation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose STeP, a novel method for improving LLM-based agent training. We synthesize self-reflected trajectories that include reflections and corrections of error steps, which enhance the effectiveness of LLM agents in learning from teacher models, enabling them to become agents capable of self-reflecting and correcting. We also introduce partial masking strategy that prevents the LLM from internalizing incorrect or suboptimal steps. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves agent performance across three representative tasks: ALFWorld, WebShop, and SciWorld. For the open-source model LLaMA2-7B-Chat, when trained using self-reflected trajectories constructed with Qwen1.5-110B-Chat as the teacher model, it achieves comprehensive improvements with less training data compared to agents trained exclusively on expert trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deciphering Trajectory-Aided LLM Reasoning: An Optimization Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19815v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework for comprehending the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through the perspective of meta-learning. By conceptualizing reasoning trajectories as pseudo-gradient descent updates to the LLM's parameters, we identify parallels between LLM reasoning and various meta-learning paradigms. We formalize the training process for reasoning tasks as a meta-learning setup, with each question treated as an individual task, and reasoning trajectories serving as the inner loop optimization for adapting model parameters. Once trained on a diverse set of questions, the LLM develops fundamental reasoning capabilities that can generalize to previously unseen questions. Extensive empirical evaluations substantiate the strong connection between LLM reasoning and meta-learning, exploring several issues of significant interest from a meta-learning standpoint. Our work not only enhances the understanding of LLM reasoning but also provides practical insights for improving these models through established meta-learning techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Flexible Forward Trajectories for Masked Molecular Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16790v2)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimpleDeepSearcher: Deep Information Seeking via Web-Powered Reasoning Trajectory Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16834v2)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have advanced large language models (LLMs) in complex deep search scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning and iterative information retrieval. However, existing approaches face critical limitations that lack high-quality training trajectories or suffer from the distributional mismatches in simulated environments and prohibitive computational costs for real-world deployment. This paper introduces SimpleDeepSearcher, a lightweight yet effective framework that bridges this gap through strategic data engineering rather than complex training paradigms. Our approach synthesizes high-quality training data by simulating realistic user interactions in live web search environments, coupled with a multi-criteria curation strategy that optimizes the diversity and quality of input and output side. Experiments on five benchmarks across diverse domains demonstrate that SFT on only 871 curated samples yields significant improvements over RL-based baselines. Our work establishes SFT as a viable pathway by systematically addressing the data-scarce bottleneck, offering practical insights for efficient deep search systems.

| **[Echo Planning for Autonomous Driving: From Current Observations to Future Trajectories and Back](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18945v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern end-to-end autonomous driving systems suffer from a critical limitation: their planners lack mechanisms to enforce temporal consistency between predicted trajectories and evolving scene dynamics. This absence of self-supervision allows early prediction errors to compound catastrophically over time. We introduce Echo Planning, a novel self-correcting framework that establishes a closed-loop Current - Future - Current (CFC) cycle to harmonize trajectory prediction with scene coherence. Our key insight is that plausible future trajectories must be bi-directionally consistent, ie, not only generated from current observations but also capable of reconstructing them. The CFC mechanism first predicts future trajectories from the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) scene representation, then inversely maps these trajectories back to estimate the current BEV state. By enforcing consistency between the original and reconstructed BEV representations through a cycle loss, the framework intrinsically penalizes physically implausible or misaligned trajectories. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, reducing L2 error by 0.04 m and collision rate by 0.12% compared to one-shot planners. Crucially, our method requires no additional supervision, leveraging the CFC cycle as an inductive bias for robust planning. This work offers a deployable solution for safety-critical autonomous systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Test-Time Scaling of Diffusion Models via Noise Trajectory Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03164v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The iterative and stochastic nature of diffusion models enables test-time scaling, whereby spending additional compute during denoising generates higher-fidelity samples. Increasing the number of denoising steps is the primary scaling axis, but this yields quickly diminishing returns. Instead optimizing the noise trajectory--the sequence of injected noise vectors--is promising, as the specific noise realizations critically affect sample quality; but this is challenging due to a high-dimensional search space, complex noise-outcome interactions, and costly trajectory evaluations. We address this by first casting diffusion as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a terminal reward, showing tree-search methods such as Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to be meaningful but impractical. To balance performance and efficiency, we then resort to a relaxation of MDP, where we view denoising as a sequence of independent contextual bandits. This allows us to introduce an $\epsilon$-greedy search algorithm that globally explores at extreme timesteps and locally exploits during the intermediate steps where de-mixing occurs. Experiments on EDM and Stable Diffusion reveal state-of-the-art scores for class-conditioned/text-to-image generation, exceeding baselines by up to $164\%$ and matching/exceeding MCTS performance. To our knowledge, this is the first practical method for test-time noise trajectory optimization of arbitrary (non-differentiable) rewards.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flow Matching for Geometric Trajectory Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18647v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The simulation of N-body systems is a fundamental problem with applications in a wide range of fields, such as molecular dynamics, biochemistry, and pedestrian dynamics. Machine learning has become an invaluable tool for scaling physics-based simulators and developing models directly from experimental data. In particular, recent advances based on deep generative modeling and geometric deep learning have enabled probabilistic simulation by modeling complex distributions over trajectories while respecting the permutation symmetry that is fundamental to N-body systems. However, to generate realistic trajectories, existing methods must learn complex transformations starting from uninformed noise and do not allow for the exploitation of domain-informed priors. In this work, we propose STFlow to address this limitation. By leveraging flow matching and data-dependent couplings, STFlow facilitates physics-informed simulation of geometric trajectories without sacrificing model expressivity or scalability. Our evaluation on N-body dynamical systems, molecular dynamics, and pedestrian dynamics benchmarks shows that STFlow produces significantly lower prediction errors while enabling more efficient inference, highlighting the benefits of employing physics-informed prior distributions in probabilistic geometric trajectory modeling.</p></details> | 20 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Optimization-Based Trajectory Planning for Tractor-Trailer Vehicles on Curvy Roads: A Progressively Increasing Sampling Number Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18590v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose an optimization-based trajectory planner for tractor-trailer vehicles on curvy roads. The lack of analytical expression for the trailer's errors to the center line pose a great challenge to the trajectory planning for tractor-trailer vehicles. To address this issue, we first use geometric representations to characterize the lateral and orientation errors in Cartesian frame, where the errors would serve as the components of the cost function and the road edge constraints within our optimization process. Next, we generate a coarse trajectory to warm-start the subsequent optimization problems. On the other hand, to achieve a good approximation of the continuous-time kinematics, optimization-based methods usually discretize the kinematics with a large sampling number. This leads to an increase in the number of the variables and constraints, thus making the optimization problem difficult to solve. To address this issue, we design a Progressively Increasing Sampling Number Optimization (PISNO) framework. More specifically, we first find a nearly feasible trajectory with a small sampling number to warm-start the optimization process. Then, the sampling number is progressively increased, and the corresponding intermediate Optimal Control Problem (OCP) is solved in each iteration. Next, we further resample the obtained solution into a finer sampling period, and then use it to warm-start the intermediate OCP in next iteration. This process is repeated until reaching a threshold sampling number. Simulation and experiment results show the proposed method exhibits a good performance and less computational consumption over the benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Do You Need for Diverse Trajectory Stitching in Diffusion Planning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18083v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In planning, stitching is an ability of algorithms to piece together sub-trajectories of data they are trained on to generate new and diverse behaviours. While stitching is historically a strength of offline reinforcement learning, recent generative behavioural cloning (BC) methods have also shown proficiency at stitching. However, the main factors behind this are poorly understood, hindering the development of new algorithms that can reliably stitch. Focusing on diffusion planners trained via BC, we find two properties are needed to compose: \emph{positional equivariance} and \emph{local receptiveness}. We use these two properties to explain architecture, data, and inference choices in existing generative BC methods based on diffusion planning, including replanning frequency, data augmentation, and data scaling. Experimental comparisions show that (1) while locality is more important than positional equivariance in creating a diffusion planner capable of composition, both are crucial (2) enabling these properties through relatively simple architecture choices can be competitive with more computationally expensive methods such as replanning or scaling data, and (3) simple inpainting-based guidance can guide architecturally compositional models to enable generalization in goal-conditioned settings.</p></details> | 9 Pages |

At the upper tier, a lightweight behavior-cloning network consumes six-axis force/torque streams from dual wrist-mounted sensors and outputs whole-body planar velocity commands that capture the leader's applied forces. At the lower tier, a deep-reinforcement-learning policy, trained under randomized payloads (0-3 kg) and friction conditions in Isaac Gym and validated in MuJoCo and on a real Unitree G1, maps these high-level twists to stable, under-load joint trajectories. By decoupling intent interpretation (force -> velocity) from legged locomotion (velocity -> joints), our method combines intuitive responsiveness to human inputs with robust, load-adaptive walking. We collect training data without motion-capture or markers, only synchronized RGB video and F/T readings, employing SAM2 and WHAM to extract 3D human pose and velocity. In real-world trials, our humanoid achieves cooperative carry-and-move performance (completion time, trajectory deviation, velocity synchrony, and follower-force) on par with a blindfolded human-follower baseline. This work is the first to demonstrate learned haptic guidance fused with full-body legged control for fluid human-humanoid co-manipulation.

| **[Learning Generalized and Flexible Trajectory Models from Omni-Semantic Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17437v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of mobile devices and data collection technologies has led to an exponential increase in trajectory data, presenting significant challenges in spatio-temporal data mining, particularly for efficient and accurate trajectory retrieval. However, existing methods for trajectory retrieval face notable limitations, including inefficiencies in large-scale data, lack of support for condition-based queries, and reliance on trajectory similarity measures. To address the above challenges, we propose OmniTraj, a generalized and flexible omni-semantic trajectory retrieval framework that integrates four complementary modalities or semantics -- raw trajectories, topology, road segments, and regions -- into a unified system. Unlike traditional approaches that are limited to computing and processing trajectories as a single modality, OmniTraj designs dedicated encoders for each modality, which are embedded and fused into a shared representation space. This design enables OmniTraj to support accurate and flexible queries based on any individual modality or combination thereof, overcoming the rigidity of traditional similarity-based methods. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of OmniTraj in handling large-scale data, providing flexible, multi-modality queries, and supporting downstream tasks and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full paper by KDD'25 - Research Track</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory-Independent Flexibility Envelopes of Energy-Constrained Systems with State-Dependent Losses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16396v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As non-dispatchable renewable power units become prominent in electric power grids, demand-side flexibility appears as a key element of future power systems' operation. Power and energy bounds are intuitive metrics to describe the flexibility of energy-constrained loads. However, to be used in operation, any power consumption trajectory fulfilling the power and energy bounds must necessarily fulfill the load's constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate that energy bounds defined as the minimum and maximum energy consumption potential of a load with state-dependent losses are Trajectory-Dependent (TD), i.e., for any energy value in the bounds a feasible power trajectory exists, but not all power trajectories enclosed in the energy envelopes satisfy the load's constraints. To guarantee the satisfaction of load constraints for all trajectories, we define Trajectory-Independent (TI) energy bounds. We present TI envelope formulations for individual loads, as well as physically coupled loads and assess the proposed formulations in a building heating system, a system with state-dependent losses. We find that using a TD envelope as energy bounds in operation may yield room temperature up to 3.8{\deg}C higher and 3.4{\deg}C lower than admissible. Overall, poorly insulated buildings observe a TI energy envelope that differs significantly from their TD envelope.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Contrastive Learning-Enhanced Trajectory Matching for Small-Scale Dataset Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15267v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying machine learning models in resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices or rapid prototyping scenarios, increasingly demands distillation of large datasets into significantly smaller yet informative synthetic datasets. Current dataset distillation techniques, particularly Trajectory Matching methods, optimize synthetic data so that the model's training trajectory on synthetic samples mirrors that on real data. While demonstrating efficacy on medium-scale synthetic datasets, these methods fail to adequately preserve semantic richness under extreme sample scarcity. To address this limitation, we propose a novel dataset distillation method integrating contrastive learning during image synthesis. By explicitly maximizing instance-level feature discrimination, our approach produces more informative and diverse synthetic samples, even when dataset sizes are significantly constrained. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating contrastive learning substantially enhances the performance of models trained on very small-scale synthetic datasets. This integration not only guides more effective feature representation but also significantly improves the visual fidelity of the synthesized images. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves notable performance improvements over existing distillation techniques, especially in scenarios with extremely limited synthetic data.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Toward Theoretical Insights into Diffusion Trajectory Distillation via Operator Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16024v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion trajectory distillation methods aim to accelerate sampling in diffusion models, which produce high-quality outputs but suffer from slow sampling speeds. These methods train a student model to approximate the multi-step denoising process of a pretrained teacher model in a single step, enabling one-shot generation. However, theoretical insights into the trade-off between different distillation strategies and generative quality remain limited, complicating their optimization and selection. In this work, we take a first step toward addressing this gap. Specifically, we reinterpret trajectory distillation as an operator merging problem in the linear regime, where each step of the teacher model is represented as a linear operator acting on noisy data. These operators admit a clear geometric interpretation as projections and rescalings corresponding to the noise schedule. During merging, signal shrinkage occurs as a convex combination of operators, arising from both discretization and limited optimization time of the student model. We propose a dynamic programming algorithm to compute the optimal merging strategy that maximally preserves signal fidelity. Additionally, we demonstrate the existence of a sharp phase transition in the optimal strategy, governed by data covariance structures. Our findings enhance the theoretical understanding of diffusion trajectory distillation and offer practical insights for improving distillation strategies.</p></details> | 31 pages, 19 figures |

To address these issues, we propose SwarmDiff, a hierarchical and scalable generative framework for swarm robots. We model the swarm's macroscopic state using Probability Density Functions (PDFs) and leverage conditional diffusion models to generate risk-aware macroscopic trajectory distributions, which then guide the generation of individual robot trajectories at the microscopic level. To ensure a balance between the swarm's optimal transportation and risk awareness, we integrate Wasserstein metrics and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). Additionally, we introduce a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to improve sampling efficiency and generation quality by capturing long-range dependencies. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that SwarmDiff outperforms existing methods in computational efficiency, trajectory validity, and scalability, making it a reliable solution for swarm robotic trajectory planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Trajectory-Based Bayesian Approach to Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization with Epoch-Aware Trade-Offs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15303v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training machine learning models inherently involves a resource-intensive and noisy iterative learning procedure that allows epoch-wise monitoring of the model performance. However, the insights gained from the iterative learning procedure typically remain underutilized in multi-objective hyperparameter optimization scenarios. Despite the limited research in this area, existing methods commonly identify the trade-offs only at the end of model training, overlooking the fact that trade-offs can emerge at earlier epochs in cases such as overfitting. To bridge this gap, we propose an enhanced multi-objective hyperparameter optimization problem that treats the number of training epochs as a decision variable, rather than merely an auxiliary parameter, to account for trade-offs at an earlier training stage. To solve this problem and accommodate its iterative learning, we then present a trajectory-based multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm characterized by two features: 1) a novel acquisition function that captures the improvement along the predictive trajectory of model performances over epochs for any hyperparameter setting and 2) a multi-objective early stopping mechanism that determines when to terminate the training to maximize epoch efficiency. Experiments on synthetic simulations and hyperparameter tuning benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively identify the desirable trade-offs while improving tuning efficiency.</p></details> |  |

When system dynamics change unexpectedly, performance degrades until models are retrained on new data. We introduce Reflexive World Models (RWM), a dual control framework that uses world model predictions as implicit reference trajectories for rapid adaptation. Our method separates the control problem into long-term reward maximization through reinforcement learning and robust motor execution through rapid latent control. This dual architecture achieves significantly faster adaptation with low online computational cost compared to model-based RL baselines, while maintaining near-optimal performance. The approach combines the benefits of flexible policy learning through reinforcement learning with rapid error correction capabilities, providing a principled approach to maintaining performance in high-dimensional continuous control tasks under varying dynamics.</p></details> |  |

However, linear models' expressive power and bias for real-world trajectories have not been thoroughly analyzed. We present an in-depth empirical analysis of the trade-off between model complexity and fit error in modelling object trajectories. We analyze vehicle, cyclist, and pedestrian trajectories. Our methodology estimates observation noise and prior distributions over model parameters from several large-scale datasets. Incorporating these priors can then regularize prediction models. Our results show that linear models do represent real-world trajectories with high fidelity at very moderate model complexity. This suggests the feasibility of using linear trajectory models in future motion prediction systems with inherent mathematical advantages.</p></details> |  |

To better understand the behavior of this metric, we systematically evaluate KL divergence across a wide range of conditions using publicly available language models. Our analysis covers comparisons between pretraining checkpoints, fine-tuned and base models, and layers via the logit lens. We find that trajectories of language models, as measured by KL divergence, exhibit a spiral structure during pretraining and thread-like progressions across layers. Furthermore, we show that, in terms of diffusion exponents, model trajectories in the log-likelihood space are more constrained than those in weight space.</p></details> |  |

We revisit the classical paradigm of Bellman Residual Minimization and introduce Trajectory Bellman Residual Minimization (TBRM), an algorithm that naturally adapts this idea to LLMs, yielding a simple yet effective off-policy algorithm that optimizes a single trajectory-level Bellman objective using the model's own logits as $Q$-values. TBRM removes the need for critics, importance-sampling ratios, or clipping, and operates with only one rollout per prompt. We prove convergence to the near-optimal KL-regularized policy from arbitrary off-policy data via an improved change-of-trajectory-measure analysis. Experiments on standard mathematical-reasoning benchmarks show that TBRM consistently outperforms policy-based baselines, like PPO and GRPO, with comparable or lower computational and memory overhead. Our results indicate that value-based RL might be a principled and efficient alternative for enhancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, existing research often overlooks the driving risk field and fails to consider the impact of risk distribution within drivable areas on trajectory planning, which poses challenges for enhancing safety. This paper proposes a trajectory planning method for intelligent vehicles based on the risk reachable set to further improve the safety of trajectory planning. First, we construct the reachable set incorporating the driving risk field to more accurately assess and avoid potential risks in drivable areas. Then, the initial trajectory is generated based on safe reinforcement learning and projected onto the reachable set. Finally, we introduce a trajectory planning method based on a constrained iterative quadratic regulator to optimize the initial solution, ensuring that the planned trajectory achieves optimal comfort, safety, and efficiency. We conduct simulation tests of trajectory planning in high-speed lane-changing scenarios. The results indicate that the proposed method can guarantee trajectory comfort and driving efficiency, with the generated trajectory situated outside high-risk boundaries, thereby ensuring vehicle safety during operation.</p></details> | <details><summary>We si...</summary><p>We sincerely request the withdrawal of this paper.

We utilize an off-the-shelf 3D human pose estimation module, a graph attention network to encode the skeleton structure, and a compact, non-autoregressive transformer suitable for real-time motion prediction for human-robot interaction and human-aware navigation. We introduce a human navigation dataset ``DARKO'' with specific focus on navigational activities that are relevant for human-aware mobile robot navigation. We perform extensive evaluation on Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and our DARKO dataset. In comparison to prior work, we show that our approach is compact, real-time, and accurate in predicting human navigation motion across all datasets.

| **[Learning Spatio-Temporal Dynamics for Trajectory Recovery via Time-Aware Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13857v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world applications, GPS trajectories often suffer from low sampling rates, with large and irregular intervals between consecutive GPS points. This sparse characteristic presents challenges for their direct use in GPS-based systems. This paper addresses the task of map-constrained trajectory recovery, aiming to enhance trajectory sampling rates of GPS trajectories. Previous studies commonly adopt a sequence-to-sequence framework, where an encoder captures the trajectory patterns and a decoder reconstructs the target trajectory. Within this framework, effectively representing the road network and extracting relevant trajectory features are crucial for overall performance. Despite advancements in these models, they fail to fully leverage the complex spatio-temporal dynamics present in both the trajectory and the road network. To overcome these limitations, we categorize the spatio-temporal dynamics of trajectory data into two distinct aspects: spatial-temporal traffic dynamics and trajectory dynamics. Furthermore, We propose TedTrajRec, a novel method for trajectory recovery. To capture spatio-temporal traffic dynamics, we introduce PD-GNN, which models periodic patterns and learns topologically aware dynamics concurrently for each road segment. For spatio-temporal trajectory dynamics, we present TedFormer, a time-aware Transformer that incorporates temporal dynamics for each GPS location by integrating closed-form neural ordinary differential equations into the attention mechanism. This allows TedFormer to effectively handle irregularly sampled data. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TedTrajRec. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ysygMhdxw/TEDTrajRec/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a journal paper in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS)</p></details> |

While recent systems combine graph neural networks (GNNs) with natural language processing (NLP) to capture structural and semantic features, their effectiveness is limited by class imbalance in real-world data. To address this, we introduce PROVSYN, an automated framework that synthesizes provenance graphs through a three-phase pipeline: (1) heterogeneous graph structure synthesis with structural-semantic modeling, (2) rule-based topological refinement, and (3) context-aware textual attribute synthesis using large language models (LLMs). PROVSYN includes a comprehensive evaluation framework that integrates structural, textual, temporal, and embedding-based metrics, along with a semantic validation mechanism to assess the correctness of generated attack patterns and system behaviors. To demonstrate practical utility, we use the synthetic graphs to augment training datasets for downstream APT detection models. Experimental results show that PROVSYN produces high-fidelity graphs and improves detection performance through effective data augmentation.</p></details> |  |

Because graph data does not follow the independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption, adversarial manipulations or incorrect data can propagate to other data points through message passing, which deteriorates the model's performance. To allow model developers to remove the adverse effects of manipulated entities from a trained GNN, we study the recently formulated problem of Corrective Unlearning. We find that current graph unlearning methods fail to unlearn the effect of manipulations even when the whole manipulated set is known. We introduce a new graph unlearning method, Cognac, which can unlearn the effect of the manipulation set even when only 5% of it is identified. It recovers most of the performance of a strong oracle with fully corrected training data, even beating retraining from scratch without the deletion set while being 8x more efficient. We hope our work assists GNN developers in mitigating harmful effects caused by issues in real-world data, post-training. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/cognac-gnn-unlearning/corrective-unlearning-for-gnns</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Quantifying the Optimization and Generalization Advantages of Graph Neural Networks Over Multilayer Perceptrons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13926v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in learning from graph-structured data, often outperforming traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) in numerous graph-based tasks. Although existing works have demonstrated the benefits of graph convolution through Laplacian smoothing, expressivity or separability, there remains a lack of quantitative analysis comparing GNNs and MLPs from an optimization and generalization perspective. This study aims to address this gap by examining the role of graph convolution through feature learning theory. Using a signal-noise data model, we conduct a comparative analysis of the optimization and generalization between two-layer graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and their MLP counterparts. Our approach tracks the trajectory of signal learning and noise memorization in GNNs, characterizing their post-training generalization. We reveal that GNNs significantly prioritize signal learning, thus enhancing the regime of {low test error} over MLPs by $D^{q-2}$ times, where $D$ denotes a node's expected degree and $q$ is the power of ReLU activation function with $q>2$. This finding highlights a substantial and quantitative discrepancy between GNNs and MLPs in terms of optimization and generalization, a conclusion further supported by our empirical simulations on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Masked Language Models are Good Heterogeneous Graph Generalizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06157v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) excel at capturing structural and semantic information in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), while struggling to generalize across domains and tasks. Recently, some researchers have turned to integrating HGNNs with large language models (LLMs) for more generalizable heterogeneous graph learning. However, these approaches typically extract structural information via HGNNs as HG tokens, and disparities in embedding spaces between HGNNs and LLMs have been shown to bias the LLM's comprehension of HGs. Moreover, as these HG tokens are often derived from node-level tasks, the model's ability to generalize across tasks remains limited. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective Masked Language Modeling-based method, called MLM4HG. MLM4HG introduces metapath-based textual sequences instead of HG tokens to extract structural and semantic information inherent in HGs, and designs customized textual templates to unify different graph tasks into a coherent cloze-style "mask" token prediction paradigm. Specifically, MLM4HG first converts HGs from various domains to texts based on metapaths, and subsequently combines them with the unified task texts to form a HG-based corpus. Moreover, the corpus is fed into a pretrained LM for fine-tuning with a constrained target vocabulary, enabling the fine-tuned LM to generalize to unseen target HGs. Extensive cross-domain and multi-task experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superior generalization performance of MLM4HG over state-of-the-art methods in both few-shot and zero-shot scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/MLM4HG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Network Generalization with Gaussian Mixture Model Based Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08638v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in tasks like node and graph classification, but they often struggle to generalize, particularly to unseen or out-of-distribution (OOD) data. These challenges are exacerbated when training data is limited in size or diversity. To address these issues, we introduce a theoretical framework using Rademacher complexity to compute a regret bound on the generalization error and then characterize the effect of data augmentation. This framework informs the design of GRATIN, an efficient graph data augmentation algorithm leveraging the capability of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to approximate any distribution. Our approach not only outperforms existing augmentation techniques in terms of generalization but also offers improved time complexity, making it highly suitable for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flow-Attentional Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06127v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential for learning from graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs do not consider the conservation law inherent in graphs associated with a flow of physical resources, such as electrical current in power grids or traffic in transportation networks, which can lead to reduced model performance. To address this, we propose flow attention, which adapts existing graph attention mechanisms to satisfy Kirchhoff\'s first law. Furthermore, we discuss how this modification influences the expressivity and identify sets of non-isomorphic graphs that can be discriminated by flow attention but not by standard attention. Through extensive experiments on two flow graph datasets (electronic circuits and power grids), we demonstrate that flow attention enhances the performance of attention-based GNNs on both graph-level classification and regression tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[HIGHT: Hierarchical Graph Tokenization for Molecule-Language Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14021v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there has been a surge of interest in extending the success of large language models (LLMs) from texts to molecules. Most existing approaches adopt a graph neural network to represent a molecule as a series of node tokens for molecule-language alignment, which, however, have overlooked the inherent hierarchical structures in molecules. Notably, higher-order molecular structures contain rich semantics of functional groups, which encode crucial biochemical functionalities of the molecules. We show that neglecting the hierarchical information in tokenization will lead to subpar molecule-language alignment and severe hallucination. To address this limitation, we propose HIerarchical GrapH Tokenization (HIGHT). HIGHT employs a hierarchical graph tokenizer that encodes the hierarchy of atom, motif, and molecular levels of informative tokens to improve the molecular perception of LLMs. HIGHT also adopts an augmented instruction tuning dataset, enriched with the hierarchical graph information, to further enhance the molecule-language alignment. Extensive experiments on 14 real-world benchmarks verify the effectiveness of HIGHT in reducing hallucination by 40%, and significant improvements in various molecule-language downstream tasks.

| **[Diffusion-Based Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks for Simulating Nonlinear Solid Mechanics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06045v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based learned simulators have emerged as a promising approach for simulating physical systems on unstructured meshes, offering speed and generalization across diverse geometries. However, they often struggle with capturing global phenomena, such as bending or long-range correlations, and suffer from error accumulation over long rollouts due to their reliance on local message passing and direct next-step prediction. We address these limitations by introducing the Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference Network (ROBIN), a novel learned simulator that integrates two key innovations: (i) Rolling Diffusion, a parallelized inference scheme that amortizes the cost of diffusion-based refinement across physical time steps by overlapping denoising steps across a temporal window. (ii) A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network built on algebraic multigrid coarsening, enabling multiscale message passing across different mesh resolutions. This architecture, implemented via Algebraic-hierarchical Message Passing Networks, captures both fine-scale local dynamics and global structural effects critical for phenomena like beam bending or multi-body contact. We validate ROBIN on challenging 2D and 3D solid mechanics benchmarks involving geometric, material, and contact nonlinearities. ROBIN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on all tasks, substantially outperforming existing next-step learned simulators while reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude compared to standard diffusion simulators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15978v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph deep learning methods have become popular tools to process collections of correlated time series. Unlike traditional multivariate forecasting methods, graph-based predictors leverage pairwise relationships by conditioning forecasts on graphs spanning the time series collection. The conditioning takes the form of architectural inductive biases on the forecasting architecture, resulting in a family of models called spatiotemporal graph neural networks. These biases allow for training global forecasting models on large collections of time series while localizing predictions w.r.t. each element in the set (nodes) by accounting for correlations among them (edges). Recent advances in graph neural networks and deep learning for time series forecasting make the adoption of such processing framework appealing and timely. However, most studies focus on refining existing architectures by exploiting modern deep-learning practices. Conversely, foundational and methodological aspects have not been subject to systematic investigation. To fill this void, this tutorial paper aims to introduce a comprehensive methodological framework formalizing the forecasting problem and providing design principles for graph-based predictors, as well as methods to assess their performance. In addition, together with an overview of the field, we provide design guidelines and best practices, as well as an in-depth discussion of open challenges and future directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a tutorial paper in ACM Computing Surveys</p></details> |
| **[On Measuring Long-Range Interactions in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05971v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-range graph tasks -- those dependent on interactions between distant nodes -- are an open problem in graph neural network research. Real-world benchmark tasks, especially the Long Range Graph Benchmark, have become popular for validating the long-range capability of proposed architectures. However, this is an empirical approach that lacks both robustness and theoretical underpinning; a more principled characterization of the long-range problem is required. To bridge this gap, we formalize long-range interactions in graph tasks, introduce a range measure for operators on graphs, and validate it with synthetic experiments. We then leverage our measure to examine commonly used tasks and architectures, and discuss to what extent they are, in fact, long-range. We believe our work advances efforts to define and address the long-range problem on graphs, and that our range measure will aid evaluation of new datasets and architectures.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Pruning Spurious Subgraphs for Graph Out-of-Distribtuion Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05957v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often encounter significant performance degradation under distribution shifts between training and test data, hindering their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent studies have proposed various methods to address the out-of-distribution generalization challenge, with many methods in the graph domain focusing on directly identifying an invariant subgraph that is predictive of the target label. However, we argue that identifying the edges from the invariant subgraph directly is challenging and error-prone, especially when some spurious edges exhibit strong correlations with the targets. In this paper, we propose PrunE, the first pruning-based graph OOD method that eliminates spurious edges to improve OOD generalizability. By pruning spurious edges, \mine{} retains the invariant subgraph more comprehensively, which is critical for OOD generalization. Specifically, PrunE employs two regularization terms to prune spurious edges: 1) graph size constraint to exclude uninformative spurious edges, and 2) $\epsilon$-probability alignment to further suppress the occurrence of spurious edges. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we show that PrunE achieves superior OOD performance and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods significantly.

| **[Deep Learning Weather Models for Subregional Ocean Forecasting: A Case Study on the Canary Current Upwelling System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24429v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oceanographic forecasting impacts various sectors of society by supporting environmental conservation and economic activities. Based on global circulation models, traditional forecasting methods are computationally expensive and slow, limiting their ability to provide rapid forecasts. Recent advances in deep learning offer faster and more accurate predictions, although these data-driven models are often trained with global data from numerical simulations, which may not reflect reality. The emergence of such models presents great potential for improving ocean prediction at a subregional domain. However, their ability to predict fine-scale ocean processes, like mesoscale structures, remains largely unknown. This work aims to adapt a graph neural network initially developed for global weather forecasting to improve subregional ocean prediction, specifically focusing on the Canary Current upwelling system. The model is trained with satellite data and compared to state-of-the-art physical ocean models to assess its performance in capturing ocean dynamics. Our results show that the deep learning model surpasses traditional methods in precision despite some challenges in upwelling areas. It demonstrated superior performance in reducing RMSE errors compared to ConvLSTM and the GLORYS reanalysis, particularly in regions with complex oceanic dynamics such as Cape Ghir, Cape Bojador, and Cape Blanc. The model achieved improvements of up to 26.5% relative to ConvLSTM and error reductions of up to 76% in 5-day forecasts compared to the GLORYS reanalysis at these critical locations, highlighting its enhanced capability to capture spatial variability and improve predictive accuracy in complex areas. These findings suggest the viability of adapting meteorological data-driven models for improving subregional medium-term ocean forecasting.</p></details> | 28 pages, 8 figures |

First, we propose GET, which combines a standard transformer encoder or decoder architecture with an innovative graph-to-sequence transformation method. This method converts graphs or sampled subgraphs into sequences of tokens representing nodes, edges, and attributes in a reversible manner using Eulerian paths. We pre-train GET using either of the two self-supervised tasks: next-token prediction (NTP) and scheduled masked-token prediction (SMTP). The pre-trained model is then fine-tuned for downstream tasks such as graph-, edge-, and node-level prediction. Despite its simplicity, GraphGPT achieves performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art methods on multiple large-scale Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) datasets. It demonstrates exceptional results on the molecular property prediction dataset PCQM4Mv2 and the protein-protein interaction dataset ogbl-ppa. Notably, generative pre-training enables scaling GraphGPT to 2 billion parameters while maintaining performance gains - a breakthrough that overcomes the scalability limitations of traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and prior graph transformers (GTs). To advance research in graph foundation models and facilitate scientific discovery in chemistry, materials science, and related fields, we will release the source code (https://github.com/alibaba/graph-gpt) and pre-trained checkpoints.</p></details> | 9 pages |

However, as a common and intuitive mode of understanding, the potential of visual perception has been overlooked in the MPNN community. For the first time, we equip MPNNs with vision structural awareness by proposing an effective framework called Graph Vision Network (GVN), along with a more efficient variant (E-GVN). Extensive empirical results demonstrate that with the proposed frameworks, GVN consistently benefits from the vision enhancement across seven link prediction datasets, including challenging large-scale graphs. Such improvements are compatible with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and GVNs achieve new SOTA results, thereby underscoring a promising novel direction for link prediction.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Traditional methods like collaborative filtering or content-based models often fail to capture users' latent preferences and complex relationships. We propose a hybrid framework integrating large language models (LLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). A pre-trained LLM encodes text data (e.g., user reviews) into rich feature vectors, while a heterogeneous user-product graph models interactions and social ties. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, text and graph information are fused within the GNN to jointly optimize embeddings. Experiments on public and real-world financial datasets show our model outperforms standalone LLM or GNN in accuracy, recall, and NDCG, with strong interpretability. This work offers new insights for personalized financial recommendations and cross-modal fusion in broader recommendation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Positional Encoding meets Persistent Homology on Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05814v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The local inductive bias of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) hampers their ability to exploit key structural information (e.g., connectivity and cycles). Positional encoding (PE) and Persistent Homology (PH) have emerged as two promising approaches to mitigate this issue. PE schemes endow GNNs with location-aware features, while PH methods enhance GNNs with multiresolution topological features. However, a rigorous theoretical characterization of the relative merits and shortcomings of PE and PH has remained elusive. We bridge this gap by establishing that neither paradigm is more expressive than the other, providing novel constructions where one approach fails but the other succeeds. Our insights inform the design of a novel learnable method, PiPE (Persistence-informed Positional Encoding), which is provably more expressive than both PH and PE. PiPE demonstrates strong performance across a variety of tasks (e.g., molecule property prediction, graph classification, and out-of-distribution generalization), thereby advancing the frontiers of graph representation learning.

Existing data-driven methods often suffer from lack of equivariance to physical symmetries, inadequate handling of collisions, and limited scalability. Here we introduce EqCollide, the first end-to-end equivariant neural fields simulator for deformable objects and their collisions. We propose an equivariant encoder to map object geometry and velocity into latent control points. A subsequent equivariant Graph Neural Network-based Neural Ordinary Differential Equation models the interactions among control points via collision-aware message passing. To reconstruct velocity fields, we query a neural field conditioned on control point features, enabling continuous and resolution-independent motion predictions. Experimental results show that EqCollide achieves accurate, stable, and scalable simulations across diverse object configurations, and our model achieves 24.34% to 35.82% lower rollout MSE even compared with the best-performing baseline model. Furthermore, our model could generalize to more colliding objects and extended temporal horizons, and stay robust to input transformed with group action.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models are Good Relational Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05725v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, yet their application to relational deep learning (RDL) remains underexplored. Existing approaches adapt LLMs by traversing relational links between entities in a database and converting the structured data into flat text documents. Still, this text-based serialization disregards critical relational structures, introduces redundancy, and often exceeds standard LLM context lengths. We introduce Rel-LLM, a novel architecture that utilizes a graph neural network (GNN)- based encoder to generate structured relational prompts for LLMs within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework. Unlike traditional text-based serialization approaches, our method preserves the inherent relational structure of databases while enabling LLMs to effectively process and reason over complex entity relationships. Specifically, the GNN encoder extracts a local subgraph around an entity to build feature representations that contain relevant entity relationships and temporal dependencies. These representations are transformed into structured prompts using a denormalization process, effectively allowing the LLM to reason over relational structures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Rel-LLM outperforms existing methods on key RDL tasks, offering a scalable and efficient approach to integrating LLMs with structured data sources. Code is available at https://github.com/smiles724/Rel-LLM.</p></details> |  |

Such components are crucial for modeling flow dynamics, without which a traditional GNN tends to treat a graph with forward and reverse topologies equal.To make GNNs sensitive to those high-frequency components thereby being capable to capture detailed topological differences, this paper proposes a novel framework that combines 1) explicit difference matrices that model directional gradients and 2) implicit physical constraints that enforce messages passing within GNNs to be consistent with natural laws. Evaluations on two real-world directed graph data, namely, water flux network and urban traffic flow network, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal.</p></details> |  |

Dynamically adding collaborative signals from neighbors helps to use similar users' preferences during learning. While item-item correlations and their impact on recommendations have been studied, the efficacy of temporal item sequences for recommendations is much less explored. In this paper, we examine temporal item sequence (sequel-aware) embeddings along with higher-order user embeddings and show that sequel-aware Graph Neural Networks have better (or comparable) recommendation performance than graph-based recommendation systems that do not consider sequel information. Extensive empirical results comparing Heterogeneous Sequel-aware Graph Neural Networks (HSAL-GNNs) to other algorithms for sequential learning (such as transformers, graph neural networks, auto-encoders) are presented on three synthetic and three real-world datasets. Our results indicate that the incorporation of sequence information from items greatly enhances recommendations.</p></details> |  |

As GNNs gain widespread popularity and demonstrate success across various domains, such as drug discovery, studying their interpretability has become a critical task. To address this, many explainability methods have been proposed, with recent efforts shifting from instance-specific explanations to global concept-based explainability. However, these approaches face several limitations, such as relying on predefined concepts and explaining only a limited set of patterns. To address this, we propose a novel framework, LOGICXGNN, for extracting interpretable logic rules from GNNs. LOGICXGNN is model-agnostic, efficient, and data-driven, eliminating the need for predefined concepts. More importantly, it can serve as a rule-based classifier and even outperform the original neural models. Its interpretability facilitates knowledge discovery, as demonstrated by its ability to extract detailed and accurate chemistry knowledge that is often overlooked by existing methods. Another key advantage of LOGICXGNN is its ability to generate new graph instances in a controlled and transparent manner, offering significant potential for applications such as drug design. We empirically demonstrate these merits through experiments on real-world datasets such as MUTAG and BBBP.</p></details> | 22 pages, 9 figures |

One popular example is the usage of graph Laplacian eigenvectors for positional encoding in MPNNs and Graph Transformers. The expressive power of such Spectrally-enhanced GNNs (SGNNs) is usually evaluated via the k-WL graph isomorphism test hierarchy and homomorphism counting. Yet, these frameworks align poorly with the graph spectra, yielding limited insight into SGNNs' expressive power. We leverage a well-studied paradigm of classifying graphs by their largest eigenvalue multiplicity to introduce an expressivity hierarchy for SGNNs. We then prove that many SGNNs are incomplete even on graphs with distinct eigenvalues. To mitigate this deficiency, we adapt rotation equivariant neural networks to the graph spectra setting to propose a method to provably improve SGNNs' expressivity on simple spectrum graphs. We empirically verify our theoretical claims via an image classification experiment on the MNIST Superpixel dataset and eigenvector canonicalization on graphs from ZINC.</p></details> | 9 pages main text |
| **[Mitigating Degree Bias Adaptively with Hard-to-Learn Nodes in Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05214v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information. This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against baselines at both global and degree levels.</p></details> |  |

Visual and geometric features offer complementary strengths. Visual features capture appearance context, while geometric features provide structural patterns. Effectively fusing these multimodal features without compromising their unique characteristics remains challenging. We observe that establishing robust, entity-specific representations before modeling interactions helps preserve the strengths of each modality. Therefore, we hypothesize that a bottom-up approach is crucial for effective multimodal fusion. Following this insight, we propose the Geometric Visual Fusion Graph Neural Network (GeoVis-GNN), which uses dual-attention feature fusion combined with interdependent entity graph learning. It progressively builds from entity-specific representations toward high-level interaction understanding. To advance HOI recognition to real-world scenarios, we introduce the Concurrent Partial Interaction Dataset (MPHOI-120). It captures dynamic multi-person interactions involving concurrent actions and partial engagement. This dataset helps address challenges like complex human-object dynamics and mutual occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across various HOI scenarios. These scenarios include two-person interactions, single-person activities, bimanual manipulations, and complex concurrent partial interactions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Expert Systems with Applications (ESWA)</p></details> |
| **[Influence Functions for Edge Edits in Non-Convex Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04694v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how individual edges influence the behavior of graph neural networks (GNNs) is essential for improving their interpretability and robustness. Graph influence functions have emerged as promising tools to efficiently estimate the effects of edge deletions without retraining. However, existing influence prediction methods rely on strict convexity assumptions, exclusively consider the influence of edge deletions while disregarding edge insertions, and fail to capture changes in message propagation caused by these modifications. In this work, we propose a proximal Bregman response function specifically tailored for GNNs, relaxing the convexity requirement and enabling accurate influence prediction for standard neural network architectures. Furthermore, our method explicitly accounts for message propagation effects and extends influence prediction to both edge deletions and insertions in a principled way. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate accurate influence predictions for different characteristics of GNNs. We further demonstrate that the influence function is versatile in applications such as graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |

This position paper argues that the influence of oversmoothing has been overstated and advocates for a further exploration of deep GNN architectures. Given the three core operations of GNNs, aggregation, linear transformation, and non-linear activation, we show that prior studies have mistakenly confused oversmoothing with the vanishing gradient, caused by transformation and activation rather than aggregation. Our finding challenges prior beliefs about oversmoothing being unique to GNNs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that classical solutions such as skip connections and normalization enable the successful stacking of deep GNN layers without performance degradation. Our results clarify misconceptions about oversmoothing and shed new light on the potential of deep GNNs.</p></details> |  |

However, the common practice of graph symmetrization discards directional information, leading to significant information loss and misleading explanations. Our analysis demonstrates how this practice compromises explanation fidelity. Through theoretical and empirical studies, we show that preserving directional semantics significantly improves explanation quality, ensuring more faithful insights for human decision-makers. These findings highlight the need for direction-aware GNN explainability in security-critical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intelligent4DSE: Optimizing High-Level Synthesis Design Space Exploration with Graph Neural Networks and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19649v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-level synthesis (HLS) design space exploration (DSE) is an optimization process in electronic design automation (EDA) that systematically explores high-level design configurations to achieve Pareto-optimal hardware implementations balancing performance, area, and power (PPA). To optimize this process, HLS prediction tasks often employ message-passing neural networks (MPNNs), leveraging complex architectures to achieve high accuracy. These predictors serve as evaluators in the DSE process, effectively bypassing the time-consuming estimations traditionally required by HLS tools. However, existing models often prioritize structural complexity and minimization of training loss, overlooking task-specific characteristics. Additionally, while evolutionary algorithms are widely used in DSE, they typically require extensive domain-specific knowledge to design effective crossover and mutation operators. To address these limitations, we propose CoGNNs-LLMEA, a framework that integrates a graph neural network with task-adaptive message passing and a large language model-enhanced evolutionary algorithm. As a predictive model, CoGNNs directly leverages intermediate representations generated from source code after compiler front-end processing, enabling prediction of quality of results (QoR) without invoking HLS tools. Due to its strong adaptability to tasks, CoGNNs can be tuned to predict post-HLS and post-implementation outcomes, effectively bridging the gap between high-level abstractions and physical implementation characteristics. CoGNNs achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy in post-HLS QoR prediction, reducing mean prediction errors by 2.8$\times$ for latency and 3.4$\times$ for resource utilization compared to baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectro-Riemannian Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00401v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can integrating spectral and curvature signals unlock new potential in graph representation learning? Non-Euclidean geometries, particularly Riemannian manifolds such as hyperbolic (negative curvature) and spherical (positive curvature), offer powerful inductive biases for embedding complex graph structures like scale-free, hierarchical, and cyclic patterns. Meanwhile, spectral filtering excels at processing signal variations across graphs, making it effective in homophilic and heterophilic settings. Leveraging both can significantly enhance the learned representations. To this end, we propose Spectro-Riemannian Graph Neural Networks (CUSP) - the first graph representation learning paradigm that unifies both CUrvature (geometric) and SPectral insights. CUSP is a mixed-curvature spectral GNN that learns spectral filters to optimize node embeddings in products of constant-curvature manifolds (hyperbolic, spherical, and Euclidean). Specifically, CUSP introduces three novel components: (a) Cusp Laplacian, an extension of the traditional graph Laplacian based on Ollivier-Ricci curvature, designed to capture the curvature signals better; (b) Cusp Filtering, which employs multiple Riemannian graph filters to obtain cues from various bands in the eigenspectrum; and (c) Cusp Pooling, a hierarchical attention mechanism combined with a curvature-based positional encoding to assess the relative importance of differently curved substructures in our graph. Empirical evaluation across eight homophilic and heterophilic datasets demonstrates the superiority of CUSP in node classification and link prediction tasks, with a gain of up to 5.3% over state-of-the-art models.

Although spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved success in modeling various static spatio-temporal forecasting scenarios, real-world spatio-temporal data are typically received in a streaming manner, and the network continuously expands with the installation of new sensors. Thus, spatio-temporal forecasting in streaming scenarios faces dual challenges: the inefficiency of retraining models over newly arrived data and the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting over long-term history. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompt tuning-based continuous forecasting method, following two fundamental tuning principles guided by empirical and theoretical analysis: expand and compress, which effectively resolve the aforementioned problems with lightweight tuning parameters. Specifically, we integrate the base spatio-temporal graph neural network with a continuous prompt pool, utilizing stored prompts (i.e., few learnable parameters) in memory, and jointly optimize them with the base spatio-temporal graph neural network. This method ensures that the model sequentially learns from the spatio-temporal data stream to accomplish tasks for corresponding periods. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the multi-faceted superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art baselines, including effectiveness, efficiency, universality, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we identify the expressivity of sparse subnetworks, i.e. their ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs, as crucial for finding winning tickets that preserve the predictive performance. We establish conditions under which the expressivity of a sparsely initialized GNN matches that of the full network, particularly when compared to the Weisfeiler-Leman test, and in that context put forward and prove a Strong Expressive Lottery Ticket Hypothesis. We subsequently show that an increased expressivity in the initialization potentially accelerates model convergence and improves generalization. Our findings establish novel theoretical foundations for both LTH and GNN research, highlighting the importance of maintaining expressivity in sparsely initialized GNNs. We illustrate our results using examples from drug discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |

Efficient joint channel and power allocation (JCPA) is crucial for managing interference. In this paper, we first propose an enhanced WMMSE (eWMMSE) algorithm to solve the JCPA problem in multi-channel wireless networks. To reduce the computational complexity of iterative optimization, we further introduce JCPGNN-M, a graph neural network-based solution that enables simultaneous multi-channel allocation for each user. We reformulate the problem as a Lagrangian function, which allows us to enforce the total power constraints systematically. Our solution involves combining this Lagrangian framework with GNNs and iteratively updating the Lagrange multipliers and resource allocation scheme. Unlike existing GNN-based methods that limit each user to a single channel, JCPGNN-M supports efficient spectrum reuse and scales well in dense network scenarios. Simulation results show that JCPGNN-M achieves better data rate compared to eWMMSE. Meanwhile, the inference time of JCPGNN-M is much lower than eWMMS, and it can generalize well to larger networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[OneForecast: A Universal Framework for Global and Regional Weather Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00338v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate weather forecasts are important for disaster prevention, agricultural planning, etc. Traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods offer physically interpretable high-accuracy predictions but are computationally expensive and fail to fully leverage rapidly growing historical data. In recent years, deep learning models have made significant progress in weather forecasting, but challenges remain, such as balancing global and regional high-resolution forecasts, excessive smoothing in extreme event predictions, and insufficient dynamic system modeling. To address these issues, this paper proposes a global-regional nested weather forecasting framework (OneForecast) based on graph neural networks. By combining a dynamic system perspective with multi-grid theory, we construct a multi-scale graph structure and densify the target region to capture local high-frequency features. We introduce an adaptive messaging mechanism, using dynamic gating units to deeply integrate node and edge features for more accurate extreme event forecasting. For high-resolution regional forecasts, we propose a neural nested grid method to mitigate boundary information loss. Experimental results show that OneForecast performs excellently across global to regional scales and short-term to long-term forecasts, especially in extreme event predictions.

| **[SF$^2$Bench: Evaluating Data-Driven Models for Compound Flood Forecasting in South Florida](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04281v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting compound floods presents a significant challenge due to the intricate interplay of meteorological, hydrological, and oceanographic factors. Analyzing compound floods has become more critical as the global climate increases flood risks. Traditional physics-based methods, such as the Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System, are often time-inefficient. Machine learning has recently demonstrated promise in both modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the scarcity of comprehensive datasets currently hinders systematic analysis. Existing water-related datasets are often limited by a sparse network of monitoring stations and incomplete coverage of relevant factors. To address this challenge, we introduce SF2Bench, a comprehensive time series collection on compound floods in South Florida, which integrates four key factors: tide, rainfall, groundwater, and human management activities (gate and pump controlling). This integration allows for a more detailed analysis of the individual contributions of these drivers to compound flooding and informs the development of improved flood forecasting approaches. To comprehensively evaluate the potential of various modeling paradigms, we assess the performance of six categories of methods, encompassing Multilayer Perceptrons, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Graph Neural Networks, Transformers, and Large Language Models. We verified the impact of different key features on flood forecasting through experiments. Our analysis examines temporal and spatial aspects, providing insights into the influence of historical data and spatial dependencies. The varying performance across these approaches underscores the diverse capabilities of each in capturing complex temporal and spatial dependencies inherent in compound floods.</p></details> | 60 Pages |

The DaigNet eliminates the need for designing a set of anchor boxes commonly used. To prove feasibility of our novel detector, we adopt detection head in YOLO models. Experiments show that the DiagNet achieves 7.5% higher mAP50 on Pascal VOC than YOLOv1. The DiagNet also shows 5.1% higher mAP on MS COCO than YOLOv3u, 3.7% higher mAP than YOLOv5u, and 2.9% higher mAP than YOLOv8.</p></details> |  |

Although conventional learning-based models have been developed to overcome these challenges, they are negatively impacted by topology changes and real-time data loss. This paper proposes a novel deep geometric learning approach based on graph neural networks (GNNs) to estimate the states of PMU-unobservable power systems. The proposed approach combines graph convolution and multi-head graph attention layers inside a customized end-to-end learning framework to handle topology changes and real-time data loss. An upper bound on SE error as a function of topology change is also derived. Experimental results for different test systems demonstrate superiority of the proposed customized GNN-SE (CGNN-SE) over traditional optimization-based techniques as well as conventional learning-based models in presence of topology changes, PMU failures, bad data, non-Gaussian measurement noise, and large system implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Large Language Models Good Temporal Graph Learners?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05393v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently driven significant advancements in Natural Language Processing and various other applications. While a broad range of literature has explored the graph-reasoning capabilities of LLMs, including their use of predictors on graphs, the application of LLMs to dynamic graphs -- real world evolving networks -- remains relatively unexplored. Recent work studies synthetic temporal graphs generated by random graph models, but applying LLMs to real-world temporal graphs remains an open question. To address this gap, we introduce Temporal Graph Talker (TGTalker), a novel temporal graph learning framework designed for LLMs. TGTalker utilizes the recency bias in temporal graphs to extract relevant structural information, converted to natural language for LLMs, while leveraging temporal neighbors as additional information for prediction. TGTalker demonstrates competitive link prediction capabilities compared to existing Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN) models. Across five real-world networks, TGTalker performs competitively with state-of-the-art temporal graph methods while consistently outperforming popular models such as TGN and HTGN. Furthermore, TGTalker generates textual explanations for each prediction, thus opening up exciting new directions in explainability and interpretability for temporal link prediction.

Recent advances in explainable GNNs have addressed this need by revealing important subgraphs that influence predictions, but these explanation mechanisms may inadvertently expose models to security risks. This paper investigates how such explanations potentially leak critical decision logic that can be exploited for model stealing. We propose {\method}, a novel stealing framework that integrates explanation alignment for capturing decision logic with guided data augmentation for efficient training under limited queries, enabling effective replication of both the predictive behavior and underlying reasoning patterns of target models. Experiments on molecular graph datasets demonstrate that our approach shows advantages over conventional methods in model stealing. This work highlights important security considerations for the deployment of explainable GNNs in sensitive domains and suggests the need for protective measures against explanation-based attacks.

Here, we present ExDiff, an interactive and modular computational framework that integrates network simulation, graph neural networks (GNNs), and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to model and interpret diffusion dynamics. ExDiff combines classical compartmental models with deep learning techniques to capture both the structural and temporal characteristics of diffusion across diverse network topologies. The framework features dedicated modules for network analysis, neural modeling, simulation, and interpretability, all accessible via an intuitive interface built on Google Colab. Through a case study of the Susceptible Infectious Recovered Vaccinated Dead (SIRVD) model, we demonstrate the capacity to simulate disease spread, evaluate intervention strategies, classify node states, and reveal the structural determinants of contagion through XAI techniques. By unifying simulation and interpretability, ExDiff provides a powerful, flexible, and accessible platform for studying diffusion phenomena in networked systems, enabling both methodological innovation and practical insight.</p></details> |  |

While directionality has been shown to substantially boost performance in graph learning tasks and is key to many real-world applications, existing SNNs fall short in representing it. To address this limitation, we introduce the Directed Cellular Sheaf, a special type of cellular sheaf designed to explicitly account for edge orientation. Building on this structure, we define a new sheaf Laplacian, the Directed Sheaf Laplacian, which captures both the graph's topology and its directional information. This operator serves as the backbone of the Directed Sheaf Neural Network (DSNN), the first SNN model to embed a directional bias into its architecture. Extensive experiments on nine real-world benchmarks show that DSNN consistently outperforms baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

The recommender system creates convenience for e-commerce users and stimulates the consumption of items that are suitable for users. In addition to e-commerce, a recommender system is also used to provide recommendations on books to read, movies to watch, courses to take or websites to visit. Similarity between users is an important impact for recommendation, which could be calculated from the data of past user ratings of the item by methods of collaborative filtering, matrix factorization or singular vector decomposition. In the development of graph data mining techniques, the relationships between users and items can be represented by matrices from which collaborative filtering could be done with the larger database, more accurate and faster in calculation. All these data can be represented graphically and mined by today's highly developed graph neural network models. On the other hand, users' social friendship data also influence consumption habits because recommendations from friends will be considered more carefully than information sources. However, combining a user's friend influence and the similarity between users whose similar shopping habits is challenging. Because the information is noisy and it affects each particular data set in different ways. In this study, we present the input data processing method to remove outliers which are single reviews or users with little interaction with the items; the next proposed model will combine the social relationship data and the similarity in the rating history of users to improve the accuracy and recall of the recommender system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Label Deconvolution for Node Representation Learning on Large-scale Attributed Graphs against Learning Bias](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14907v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node representation learning on attributed graphs -- whose nodes are associated with rich attributes (e.g., texts and protein sequences) -- plays a crucial role in many important downstream tasks. To encode the attributes and graph structures simultaneously, recent studies integrate pre-trained models with graph neural networks (GNNs), where pre-trained models serve as node encoders (NEs) to encode the attributes. As jointly training large NEs and GNNs on large-scale graphs suffers from severe scalability issues, many methods propose to train NEs and GNNs separately. Consequently, they do not take feature convolutions in GNNs into consideration in the training phase of NEs, leading to a significant learning bias relative to the joint training. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient label regularization technique, namely Label Deconvolution (LD), to alleviate the learning bias by a novel and highly scalable approximation to the inverse mapping of GNNs. The inverse mapping leads to an objective function that is equivalent to that by the joint training, while it can effectively incorporate GNNs in the training phase of NEs against the learning bias. More importantly, we show that LD converges to the optimal objective function values by the joint training under mild assumptions. Experiments demonstrate LD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Open Graph Benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

Users typically have different rate demands and are clustered into groups in practice based on their requirements, where the former results in the trade-off between maximizing the rate and satisfying fine-grained rate demands, while the latter causes a trade-off between inter-group competition and intra-group cooperation when maximizing the sum rate. However, traditional approaches often overlook the joint optimization encompassing both of these trade-offs, disregarding potential optimal solutions and leaving some users even consistently at low date rates. To address this issue, we propose a novel joint optimization model for a RIS- and DF-assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) system where a base station (BS) is with multiple antennas transmits data by multiple RISs and DF relays to serve grouped users with fine-grained rate demands. We design a new loss function to not only optimize the sum rate of all groups but also adjust the satisfaction ratio of fine-grained rate demands by modifying the penalty parameter. We further propose a two-phase graph neural network (GNN) based approach that inputs channel state information (CSI) to simultaneously and autonomously learn efficient phase shifts, beamforming, and relay selection. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves system performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 Pa...</summary><p>14 Pages, 9 figures, accepted by IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS</p></details> |

Self-supervised learning on heterogeneous graphs, especially contrastive self-supervised strategy, shows great potential when there are no labels. However, this approach requires the use of carefully designed graph augmentation strategies and the selection of positive and negative samples. Determining the exact level of similarity between sample pairs is non-trivial.To solve this problem, we propose a novel self-supervised Heterogeneous graph neural network with Optimal Transport (HGOT) method which is designed to facilitate self-supervised learning for heterogeneous graphs without graph augmentation strategies. Different from traditional contrastive self-supervised learning, HGOT employs the optimal transport mechanism to relieve the laborious sampling process of positive and negative samples. Specifically, we design an aggregating view (central view) to integrate the semantic information contained in the views represented by different meta-paths (branch views). Then, we introduce an optimal transport plan to identify the transport relationship between the semantics contained in the branch view and the central view. This allows the optimal transport plan between graphs to align with the representations, forcing the encoder to learn node representations that are more similar to the graph space and of higher quality. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed HGOT model can achieve state-of-the-art performance on various downstream tasks. In particular, in the node classification task, HGOT achieves an average of more than 6% improvement in accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has 9 pages of text and 13 pages in total (including acknowledgments, impact statement, references, and appendix), with 6 figures and 2 tables.

However, an important histopathological task, where GNNs have not been extensively explored, is the classification of glomeruli health as an important indicator in nephropathology. This task presents unique difficulties, particularly for the graph construction, i.e., the identification of nodes, edges, and informative features. In this work, we propose a pipeline composed of different traditional and machine learning-based computer vision techniques to identify nodes, edges, and their corresponding features to form a heterogeneous graph. We then proceed to propose a novel heterogeneous GNN architecture for glomeruli classification, called HIEGNet, that integrates both glomeruli and their surrounding immune cells. Hence, HIEGNet is able to consider the immune environment of each glomerulus in its classification. Our HIEGNet was trained and tested on a dataset of Whole Slide Images from kidney transplant patients. Experimental results demonstrate that HIEGNet outperforms several baseline models and generalises best between patients among all baseline models.

Consequently, IRS-assisted NOMA communications have garnered significant research interest. However, the passive nature of the IRS, lacking authentication and security protocols, makes these systems vulnerable to external eavesdropping due to the openness of electromagnetic signal propagation and reflection. NOMA's inherent multi-user signal superposition also introduces internal eavesdropping risks during user pairing. This paper investigates secure transmissions in IRS-assisted NOMA systems with heterogeneous resource configuration in wireless networks to mitigate both external and internal eavesdropping. To maximize the sum secrecy rate of legitimate users, we propose a combinatorial optimization graph neural network (CO-GNN) approach to jointly optimize beamforming at the base station, power allocation of NOMA users, and phase shifts of IRS for dynamic heterogeneous resource allocation, thereby enabling the design of dual-link or multi-link secure transmissions in the presence of eavesdroppers on the same or heterogeneous links. The CO-GNN algorithm simplifies the complex mathematical problem-solving process, eliminates the need for channel estimation, and enhances scalability. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances the secure transmission performance of the system.</p></details> |  |

Fires can originate at any point within a structure, and simulating every potential fire scenario is both expensive and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose the concept of the Most Fire-Sensitive Point (MFSP) and an efficient machine learning framework for its identification. The MFSP is defined as the location at which a fire, if initiated, would cause the most severe detrimental impact on the building's stability, effectively representing the worst-case fire scenario. In our framework, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) serves as an efficient and differentiable agent for conventional Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulators by predicting the Maximum Interstory Drift Ratio (MIDR) under fire, which then guides the training and evaluation of the MFSP predictor. Additionally, we enhance our framework with a novel edge update mechanism and a transfer learning-based training scheme. Evaluations on a large-scale simulation dataset demonstrate the good performance of the proposed framework in identifying the MFSP, offering a transformative tool for optimizing fire safety assessments in structural design.

| **[From Features to Structure: Task-Aware Graph Construction for Relational and Tabular Learning with GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02243v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular and relational data remain the most ubiquitous formats in real-world machine learning applications, spanning domains from finance to healthcare. Although both formats offer structured representations, they pose distinct challenges for modern deep learning methods, which typically assume flat, feature-aligned inputs. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising solution by capturing structural dependencies within and between tables. However, existing GNN-based approaches often rely on rigid, schema-derived graphs -- such as those based on primary-foreign key links -- thereby underutilizing rich, predictive signals in non key attributes. In this work, we introduce auGraph, a unified framework for task-aware graph augmentation that applies to both tabular and relational data. auGraph enhances base graph structures by selectively promoting attributes into nodes, guided by scoring functions that quantify their relevance to the downstream prediction task. This augmentation preserves the original data schema while injecting task-relevant structural signal. Empirically, auGraph outperforms schema-based and heuristic graph construction methods by producing graphs that better support learning for relational and tabular prediction tasks.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |

Explainability methods address this by providing feature-level explanations that identify important node attributes for predictions. These explanations create privacy risks. Combined with auxiliary information, feature explanations can enable adversaries to reconstruct graph structure, exposing sensitive relationships. Existing graph reconstruction attacks assume access to original auxiliary data, but practical systems use differential privacy to protect node features and labels while providing explanations for transparency. We study a threat model where adversaries access public feature explanations along with privatized node features and labels. We show that existing explanation-based attacks like GSEF perform poorly with privatized data due to noise from differential privacy mechanisms. We propose ReconXF, a graph reconstruction attack for scenarios with public explanations and privatized auxiliary data. Our method adapts explanation-based frameworks by incorporating denoising mechanisms that handle differential privacy noise while exploiting structural signals in explanations. Experiments across multiple datasets show ReconXF outperforms SoTA methods in privatized settings, with improvements in AUC and average precision. Results indicate that public explanations combined with denoising enable graph structure recovery even under the privacy protection of auxiliary data.

This interconnectedness and sensitivity of financial markets make understanding these relationships crucial for investors and policymakers to predict stock price movements accurately. To this end, we examined the main stock market indices of G7 and MINT countries from 2012 to 2024, using a recent graph neural network (GNN) algorithm called multivariate time series forecasting with graph neural network (MTGNN). This method allows for considering complex spatio-temporal connections in multivariate time series. In the implementations, MTGNN revealed that the US and Canada are the most influential G7 countries regarding stock indices in the forecasting process, and Indonesia and T\"urkiye are the most influential MINT countries. Additionally, our results showed that MTGNN outperformed traditional methods in forecasting the prices of stock market indices for MINT and G7 countries. Consequently, the study offers valuable insights into economic blocks' markets and presents a compelling empirical approach to analyzing global stock market dynamics using MTGNN.</p></details> |  |

Integrating external knowledge resources, particularly knowledge graphs (KGs), provides a transparent and updatable foundation for more reliable reasoning. Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), which queries and reasons over KGs, is central to this effort, especially for complex, multi-hop queries. However, multi-hop reasoning poses two key challenges: (1)~maintaining coherent reasoning paths, and (2)~avoiding prematurely discarding critical multi-hop connections. To address these issues, we introduce iQUEST, a question-guided KBQA framework that iteratively decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, ensuring a structured and focused reasoning trajectory. Additionally, we integrate a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look ahead and incorporate 2-hop neighbor information at each reasoning step. This dual approach strengthens the reasoning process, enabling the model to explore viable paths more effectively. Detailed experiments demonstrate the consistent improvement delivered by iQUEST across four benchmark datasets and four LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (Main)</p></details> |
| **[Principled data augmentation for learning to solve quadratic programming problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01728v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear and quadratic optimization are crucial in numerous real-world applications, from training machine learning models to integer-linear optimization. Recently, learning-to-optimize methods (L2O) for linear (LPs) or quadratic programs (QPs) using message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) have gained traction, promising lightweight, data-driven proxies for solving such optimization problems. For example, they replace the costly computation of strong branching scores in branch-and-bound solvers, requiring solving many such optimization problems. However, robust L2O MPNNs remain challenging in data-scarce settings, especially when addressing complex optimization problems such as QPs. This work introduces a principled approach to data augmentation tailored for QPs via MPNNs. Our method leverages theoretically justified data augmentation techniques to generate diverse yet optimality-preserving instances. Furthermore, we integrate these augmentations into a self-supervised learning framework based on contrastive learning, thereby pretraining MPNNs for enhanced performance on L2O tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves generalization in supervised scenarios and facilitates effective transfer learning to related optimization problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finding Counterfactual Evidences for Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11396v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counterfactual learning is emerging as an important paradigm, rooted in causality, which promises to alleviate common issues of graph neural networks (GNNs), such as fairness and interpretability. However, as in many real-world application domains where conducting randomized controlled trials is impractical, one has to rely on available observational (factual) data to detect counterfactuals. In this paper, we introduce and tackle the problem of searching for counterfactual evidences for the GNN-based node classification task. A counterfactual evidence is a pair of nodes such that, regardless they exhibit great similarity both in the features and in their neighborhood subgraph structures, they are classified differently by the GNN. We develop effective and efficient search algorithms and a novel indexing solution that leverages both node features and structural information to identify counterfactual evidences, and generalizes beyond any specific GNN. Through various downstream applications, we demonstrate the potential of counterfactual evidences to enhance fairness and accuracy of GNNs.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

However, such accuracy is limited by the ability to manage automatic monitoring of pain in those animals. Facial expression scoring is a widely used and useful method to evaluate pain in both humans and other living beings. Researchers also analyzed the facial expressions of sheep to assess their health state and concluded that facial landmark detection and pain level prediction are essential. For this purpose, we propose a novel weighted graph neural network (WGNN) model to link sheep's detected facial landmarks and define pain levels. Furthermore, we propose a new sheep facial landmarks dataset that adheres to the parameters of the Sheep Facial Expression Scale (SPFES). Currently, there is no comprehensive performance benchmark that specifically evaluates the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) on sheep facial landmark data to detect and measure pain levels. The YOLOv8n detector architecture achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 59.30% with the sheep facial landmarks dataset, among seven other detection models. The WGNN framework has an accuracy of 92.71% for tracking multiple facial parts expressions with the YOLOv8n lightweight on-board device deployment-capable model.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 19th International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG)</p></details> |

Current approaches often struggle with computational costs or effective fusion of disparate modalities. We propose \textbf{Graph Masked Language Model (GMLM)}, a novel architecture efficiently combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). GMLM introduces three key innovations: (i) a \textbf{dynamic active node selection} strategy for scalable PLM text processing; (ii) a GNN-specific \textbf{contrastive pretraining stage} using soft masking with a learnable graph \texttt{[MASK]} token for robust structural representations; and (iii) a \textbf{dedicated fusion module} integrating RGCN-based GNN embeddings with PLM (GTE-Small \& DistilBERT) embeddings. Extensive experiments on heterophilic benchmarks (Cornell, Wisconsin, Texas) demonstrate GMLM's superiority. Notably, GMLM(DistilBERT) achieves significant performance gains, improving accuracy by over \textbf{4.7\%} on Cornell and over \textbf{2.0\%} on Texas compared to the previous best-performing baselines. This work underscores the benefits of targeted PLM engagement and modality-specific pretraining for improved, efficient learning on text-rich graphs.</p></details> |  |

We initiate our discussion by examining various molecular representations, followed by detailed discussions and categorization of existing GNN models based on their input types and downstream application tasks. We also collect a list of commonly used benchmark datasets for a variety of applications.

| **[Towards Efficient Few-shot Graph Neural Architecture Search via Partitioning Gradient Contribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01231v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the weight coupling problem, certain studies introduced few-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods, which partition the supernet into multiple sub-supernets. However, these methods often suffer from computational inefficiency and tend to provide suboptimal partitioning schemes. To address this problem more effectively, we analyze the weight coupling problem from a novel perspective, which primarily stems from distinct modules in succeeding layers imposing conflicting gradient directions on the preceding layer modules. Based on this perspective, we propose the Gradient Contribution (GC) method that efficiently computes the cosine similarity of gradient directions among modules by decomposing the Vector-Jacobian Product during supernet backpropagation. Subsequently, the modules with conflicting gradient directions are allocated to distinct sub-supernets while similar ones are grouped together. To assess the advantages of GC and address the limitations of existing Graph Neural Architecture Search methods, which are limited to searching a single type of Graph Neural Networks (Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) or Graph Transformers (GTs)), we propose the Unified Graph Neural Architecture Search (UGAS) framework, which explores optimal combinations of MPNNs and GTs. The experimental results demonstrate that GC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in supernet partitioning quality and time efficiency. In addition, the architectures searched by UGAS+GC outperform both the manually designed GNNs and those obtained by existing NAS methods. Finally, ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of all proposed methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2025</p></details> |

In this work, to address these issues, we propose a multi-modal prompt learning paradigm to effectively adapt pre-trained GNN to downstream tasks and data, given only a few semantically labeled samples, each with extremely weak text supervision. Our new paradigm embeds the graphs directly in the same space as the Large Language Models (LLMs) by learning both graph prompts and text prompts simultaneously. We demonstrate the superior performance of our paradigm in few-shot, multi-task-level, and cross-domain settings. Moreover, we build the first CLIP-style zero-shot classification prototype that can generalize GNNs to unseen classes with extremely weak text supervision.

Our approach, termed GLEVR, consists of constructing a graph where each video clip of the egocentric video corresponds to a node. The constructed graphs are sparse and computationally efficient, outperforming existing larger models substantially. We further leverage alignment between egocentric and exocentric videos during training for improved inference on egocentric videos, as well as adding automatic captioning as an additional modality. We consider each clip of each exocentric video (if available) or video captions as additional nodes during training. We examine several strategies to define connections across these nodes. We perform extensive experiments on the Ego-Exo4D dataset and show that our proposed flexible graph-based framework notably outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |

| **[Graph Neural Networks for Jamming Source Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03196v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based learning has emerged as a transformative approach for modeling complex relationships across diverse domains, yet its potential in wireless security remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce the first application of graph-based learning for jamming source localization, addressing the imminent threat of jamming attacks in wireless networks. Unlike geometric optimization techniques that struggle under environmental uncertainties and dense interference, we reformulate localization as an inductive graph regression task. Our approach integrates structured node representations that encode local and global signal aggregation, ensuring spatial coherence and adaptive signal fusion. To enhance robustness, we incorporate an attention-based graph neural network that adaptively refines neighborhood influence and introduces a confidence-guided estimation mechanism that dynamically balances learned predictions with domain-informed priors. We evaluate our approach under complex radio frequency environments with varying sampling densities and signal propagation conditions, conducting comprehensive ablation studies on graph construction, feature selection, and pooling strategies. Results demonstrate that our novel graph-based learning framework significantly outperforms established localization baselines, particularly in challenging scenarios with sparse and obfuscated signal information.

While deep collaborative filtering approaches using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at capturing user-item relationships, their effectiveness is limited when handling sparse data or zero-shot scenarios, primarily due to constraints in ID-based embedding functions. To address these challenges, we propose a model-agnostic recommendation instruction-tuning paradigm that seamlessly integrates large language models with collaborative filtering. Our proposed $\underline{Rec}$ommendation $\underline{L}$anguage $\underline{M}$odel (RecLM) enhances the capture of user preference diversity through a carefully designed reinforcement learning reward function that facilitates self-augmentation of language models. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate significant advantages of our approach across various settings, and its plug-and-play compatibility with state-of-the-art recommender systems results in notable performance enhancements.

Learning-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative, and among them, graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their excellent performance in solving power control problems. However, all existing GNN-based approaches assume ideal orthogonality among pilot sequences for user equipments (UEs), which is unrealistic given that the number of UEs exceeds the available orthogonal pilot sequences in CFmMIMO schemes. Moreover, most learning-based methods assume a fixed number of UEs, whereas the number of active UEs varies over time in practice. Additionally, supervised training necessitates costly computational resources for computing the target power control solutions for a large volume of training samples. To address these issues, we propose a graph attention network for downlink power control in CFmMIMO systems that operates in a self-supervised manner while effectively handling pilot contamination and adapting to a dynamic number of UEs. Experimental results show its effectiveness, even in comparison to the optimal accelerated projected gradient method as a baseline.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) for MS prediction, current approaches face two critical limitations: (1) incomplete molecular modeling due to atom-centric message-passing mechanisms that disregard bond-level topological features, and (2) prediction frameworks that lack reliable uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we propose TrustworthyMS, a novel contrastive learning framework designed for uncertainty-aware metabolic stability prediction. First, a molecular graph topology remapping mechanism synchronizes atom-bond interactions through edge-induced feature propagation, capturing both localized electronic effects and global conformational constraints. Second, contrastive topology-bond alignment enforces consistency between molecular topology views and bond patterns via feature alignment, enhancing representation robustness. Third, uncertainty modeling through Beta-Binomial uncertainty quantification enables simultaneous prediction and confidence calibration under epistemic uncertainty. Through extensive experiments, our results demonstrate that TrustworthyMS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of predictive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted for publication at ECML-PKDD 2025.

In this work, we challenge this assumption by introducing the graph unlearning inversion attack: given only black-box access to an unlearned GNN and partial graph knowledge, can an adversary reconstruct the removed edges? We identify two key challenges: varying probability-similarity thresholds for unlearned versus retained edges, and the difficulty of locating unlearned edge endpoints, and address them with TrendAttack. First, we derive and exploit the confidence pitfall, a theoretical and empirical pattern showing that nodes adjacent to unlearned edges exhibit a large drop in model confidence. Second, we design an adaptive prediction mechanism that applies different similarity thresholds to unlearned and other membership edges. Our framework flexibly integrates existing membership inference techniques and extends them with trend features. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that TrendAttack significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GNN membership inference baselines, exposing a critical privacy vulnerability in current graph unlearning methods.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately forecasting STTS is challenging due to complex dynamic correlations in both time and space dimensions. Existing graph neural networks struggle to balance effectiveness and efficiency in modeling dynamic spatio-temporal relations. To address this problem, we propose the Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Stiefel Graph Neural Network (DST-SGNN) to efficiently process STTS. For DST-SGNN, we first introduce the novel Stiefel Graph Spectral Convolution (SGSC) and Stiefel Graph Fourier Transform (SGFT). The SGFT matrix in SGSC is constrained to lie on the Stiefel manifold, and SGSC can be regarded as a filtered graph spectral convolution. We also propose the Linear Dynamic Graph Optimization on Stiefel Manifold (LDGOSM), which can efficiently learn the SGFT matrix from the dynamic graph and significantly reduce the computational complexity. Finally, we propose a multi-layer SGSC (MSGSC) that efficiently captures complex spatio-temporal correlations. Extensive experiments on seven spatio-temporal datasets show that DST-SGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining relatively low computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

The growing number of transactions makes it necessary to use automatic tools that help law enforcement agencies detect such criminal activity. In this work, we present Amatriciana, a novel approach based on Graph Neural Networks to detect money launderers inside a graph of transactions by considering temporal information. Amatriciana uses the whole graph of transactions without splitting it into several time-based subgraphs, exploiting all relational information in the dataset. Our experiments on a public dataset reveal that the model can learn from a limited amount of data. Furthermore, when more data is available, the model outperforms other State-of-the-art approaches; in particular, Amatriciana decreases the number of False Positives (FPs) while detecting many launderers. In summary, Amatriciana achieves an F1 score of 0.76. In addition, it lowers the FPs by 55% with respect to other State-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |

As pretraining generally requires huge amount of data and computational resources, the pretrained GNNs are high-value Intellectual Properties (IP) of the legitimate owner. However, adversaries may illegally copy and deploy the pretrained GNN models for their downstream tasks. Though initial efforts have been made to watermark GNN classifiers for IP protection, these methods require the target classification task for watermarking, and thus are not applicable to self-supervised pretraining of GNN models. Hence, in this work, we propose a novel framework named PreGIP to watermark the pretraining of GNN encoder for IP protection while maintain the high-quality of the embedding space. PreGIP incorporates a task-free watermarking loss to watermark the embedding space of pretrained GNN encoder. A finetuning-resistant watermark injection is further deployed.

Recent advancements have shown potential in addressing these challenges by developing suitable meta-learning-based dynamic graph neural network models. However, most meta-learning approaches for dynamic graphs rely on fixed weight update parameters, neglecting the essential intrinsic complex high-order topological information of dynamically evolving graphs. We have designed Dowker Zigzag Persistence (DZP), an efficient and stable dynamic graph persistent homology representation method based on Dowker complex and zigzag persistence, to capture the high-order features of dynamic graphs. Armed with the DZP ideas, we propose TMetaNet, a new meta-learning parameter update model based on dynamic topological features.

However, the effectiveness and efficiency of these Transformer-based DGNNs vary significantly, highlighting the importance of properly defining the SAM on dynamic graphs and comprehensively encoding temporal and interactive dynamics without extra complex modules. In this work, we propose TIDFormer, a dynamic graph TransFormer that fully exploits Temporal and Interactive Dynamics in an efficient manner. We clarify and verify the interpretability of our proposed SAM, addressing the open problem of its uninterpretable definitions on dynamic graphs in previous works. To model the temporal and interactive dynamics, respectively, we utilize the calendar-based time partitioning information and extract informative interaction embeddings for both bipartite and non-bipartite graphs using merely the sampled first-order neighbors. In addition, we jointly model temporal and interactive features by capturing potential changes in historical interaction patterns through a simple decomposition. We conduct extensive experiments on several dynamic graph datasets to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of TIDFormer. The experimental results demonstrate that TIDFormer excels, outperforming state-of-the-art models across most datasets and experimental settings. Furthermore, TIDFormer exhibits significant efficiency advantages compared to previous Transformer-based methods.</p></details> | KDD2025 |

Although there are many machine learning models available for this purpose, those that achieve high accuracy while also offering interpretability of predictions are uncommon. We present a graph neural network that not only matches the prediction accuracies of leading models but also provides insights on four levels of molecular substructures. This model helps identify which atoms, bonds, molecular fragments, and connections between fragments are significant for predicting a specific molecular property. Understanding the importance of connections between fragments is particularly valuable for molecules with substructures that do not connect through standard bonds. The model additionally can quantify the impact of specific fragments on the prediction, allowing the identification of fragments that may improve or degrade a property value. These interpretable features are essential for deriving scientific insights from the model's learned relationships between molecular structures and properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[GrapheonRL: A Graph Neural Network and Reinforcement Learning Framework for Constraint and Data-Aware Workflow Mapping and Scheduling in Heterogeneous HPC Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00260v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective resource utilization and decreased makespan in heterogeneous High Performance Computing (HPC) environments are key benefits of workload mapping and scheduling. Tools such as Snakemake, a workflow management solution, employ Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and heuristic techniques to deploy workflows in various HPC environments like SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) or Kubernetes. Its scheduler factors in workflow task dependencies, resource requirements, and individual task data sizes before system deployment. ILP offers optimal solutions respecting constraints, but only for smaller workflows. Meanwhile, meta-heuristics and heuristics offer faster, though suboptimal, makespan. As problem sizes, system constraints, and complexities evolve, maintaining these schedulers becomes challenging. In this study, we propose a novel solution that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to flexibly handle workflows, dynamic constraints, and heterogeneous resources while providing quick responses. GNN manages dependencies and resource requirements, and RL optimizes scheduling decision-making via a learned policy, overcoming the need for a comprehensive global search. Experimental results with different datasets demonstrate that this method effectively adapts to different workflows, adheres to HPC constraints, and offers optimal solutions akin to ILP but with drastically reduced execution times (76 percent faster), comparable to heuristic methods (only 3.85 times slower than OLB). Our contribution is to provide a robust yet scalable mapping and scheduling solution that can handle changing constraints, as well as workload sizes and complexities in a heterogeneous HPC Compute Continuum system landscape.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, IEEE COMPSAC 2025 Conference</p></details> |

Trade-offs and sample complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00252v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the recent years, branch-and-cut algorithms have been the target of data-driven approaches designed to enhance the decision making in different phases of the algorithm such as branching, or the choice of cutting planes (cuts). In particular, for cutting plane selection two score functions have been proposed in the literature to evaluate the quality of a cut: branch-and-cut tree size and gap closed. In this paper, we present new sample complexity lower bounds, valid for both scores. We show that for a wide family of classes $\mathcal{F}$ that maps an instance to a cut, learning over an unknown distribution of the instances to minimize those scores requires at least (up to multiplicative constants) as many samples as learning from the same class function $\mathcal{F}$ any generic target function (using square loss). Our results also extend to the case of learning from a restricted set of cuts, namely those from the Simplex tableau. To the best of our knowledge, these constitute the first lower bounds for the learning-to-cut framework. We compare our bounds to known upper bounds in the case of neural networks and show they are nearly tight. We illustrate our results with a graph neural network selection evaluated on set covering and facility location integer programming models and we empirically show that the gap closed score is an effective proxy to minimize the branch-and-cut tree size. Although the gap closed score has been extensively used in the integer programming literature, this is the first principled analysis discussing both scores at the same time both theoretically and computationally.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeGLIF for Label Noise Robust Node Classification using GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00244v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Noisy labelled datasets are generally inexpensive compared to clean labelled datasets, and the same is true for graph data. In this paper, we propose a denoising technique DeGLIF: Denoising Graph Data using Leave-One-Out Influence Function. DeGLIF uses a small set of clean data and the leave-one-out influence function to make label noise robust node-level prediction on graph data. Leave-one-out influence function approximates the change in the model parameters if a training point is removed from the training dataset. Recent advances propose a way to calculate the leave-one-out influence function for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We extend that recent work to estimate the change in validation loss, if a training node is removed from the training dataset. We use this estimate and a new theoretically motivated relabelling function to denoise the training dataset. We propose two DeGLIF variants to identify noisy nodes. Both these variants do not require any information about the noise model or the noise level in the dataset; DeGLIF also does not estimate these quantities. For one of these variants, we prove that the noisy points detected can indeed increase risk. We carry out detailed computational experiments on different datasets to show the effectiveness of DeGLIF. It achieves better accuracy than other baseline algorithms</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Backdoor Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00191v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) excel in modeling complex, multi-typed relationships across diverse domains, yet their vulnerability to backdoor attacks remains unexplored. To address this gap, we conduct the first investigation into the susceptibility of HGNNs to existing graph backdoor attacks, revealing three critical issues: (1) high attack budget required for effective backdoor injection, (2) inefficient and unreliable backdoor activation, and (3) inaccurate attack effectiveness evaluation. To tackle these issues, we propose the Heterogeneous Graph Backdoor Attack (HGBA), the first backdoor attack specifically designed for HGNNs, introducing a novel relation-based trigger mechanism that establishes specific connections between a strategically selected trigger node and poisoned nodes via the backdoor metapath. HGBA achieves efficient and stealthy backdoor injection with minimal structural modifications and supports easy backdoor activation through two flexible strategies: Self-Node Attack and Indiscriminate Attack. Additionally, we improve the ASR measurement protocol, enabling a more accurate assessment of attack effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HGBA far surpasses multiple state-of-the-art graph backdoor attacks in black-box settings, efficiently attacking HGNNs with low attack budgets. Ablation studies show that the strength of HBGA benefits from our trigger node selection method and backdoor metapath selection strategy. In addition, HGBA shows superior robustness against node feature perturbations and multiple types of existing graph backdoor defense mechanisms. Finally, extension experiments demonstrate that the relation-based trigger mechanism can effectively extend to tasks in homogeneous graph scenarios, thereby posing severe threats to broader security-critical domains.</p></details> |  |

We identified a research gap in the current state of the art, which lies in the inability of models to adapt to changes in the power grid, such as loss of sensors and branch switching, in a zero-shot fashion. Based on the literature, we identified graph neural networks as the most promising class of models for this use case. Our experiments confirm their robustness to some grid changes and also show that a deeper network does not always perform better. We propose data augmentations to improve performance and conduct a comprehensive grid search of different model configurations for common zero-shot learning scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 2 figures, associated source code available at https://gitlab.com/transense/nse-tl-paper/tree/IARIA</p></details> |

To address this, we introduce MAGIC-VQA, a novel framework that enhances VQA by systematically integrating commonsense knowledge with LVLMs. MAGIC-VQA employs a three-stage process: (1) Explicit Knowledge Integration from external sources, (2) By-Type Post-Processing for contextual refinement, and (3) Implicit Knowledge Augmentation using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for structured reasoning. While GNNs bring greater depth to structured inference, they enable superior relational inference beyond LVLMs. MAGIC-VQA bridges a key gap by unifying commonsensse knowledge with LVLM-driven reasoning, eliminating the need for extensive pre-training or complex prompt tuning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, significantly improving commonsense reasoning in VQA.</p></details> | Findings of ACL 2025 |
| **[Directed Homophily-Aware Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22362v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in various learning tasks on graph-structured data. Nevertheless, most GNNs struggle to generalize to heterophilic neighborhoods. Additionally, many GNNs ignore the directional nature of real-world graphs, resulting in suboptimal performance on directed graphs with asymmetric structures. In this work, we propose Directed Homophily-aware Graph Neural Network (DHGNN), a novel framework that addresses these limitations by incorporating homophily-aware and direction-sensitive components. DHGNN employs a resettable gating mechanism to adaptively modulate message contributions based on homophily levels and informativeness, and a structure-aware noise-tolerant fusion module to effectively integrate node representations from the original and reverse directions. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic directed graph datasets demonstrate that DHGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification and link prediction. In particular, DHGNN improves over the best baseline by up to 15.07% in link prediction. Our analysis further shows that the gating mechanism captures directional homophily gaps and fluctuating homophily across layers, providing deeper insights into message-passing behavior on complex graph structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Classic GNNs Be Strong Baselines for Graph-level Tasks? Simple Architectures Meet Excellence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09263v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are often criticized for their limited expressiveness, issues like over-smoothing and over-squashing, and challenges in capturing long-range dependencies. Conversely, Graph Transformers (GTs) are regarded as superior due to their employment of global attention mechanisms, which potentially mitigate these challenges. Literature frequently suggests that GTs outperform GNNs in graph-level tasks, especially for graph classification and regression on small molecular graphs. In this study, we explore the untapped potential of GNNs through an enhanced framework, GNN+, which integrates six widely used techniques: edge feature integration, normalization, dropout, residual connections, feed-forward networks, and positional encoding, to effectively tackle graph-level tasks. We conduct a systematic re-evaluation of three classic GNNs (GCN, GIN, and GatedGCN) enhanced by the GNN+ framework across 14 well-known graph-level datasets. Our results reveal that, contrary to prevailing beliefs, these classic GNNs consistently match or surpass the performance of GTs, securing top-three rankings across all datasets and achieving first place in eight. Furthermore, they demonstrate greater efficiency, running several times faster than GTs on many datasets. This highlights the potential of simple GNN architectures, challenging the notion that complex mechanisms in GTs are essential for superior graph-level performance.

| **[Kolmogorov-Arnold Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18354v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel in learning from network-like data but often lack interpretability, making their application challenging in domains requiring transparent decision-making. We propose the Graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (GKAN), a novel GNN model leveraging spline-based activation functions on edges to enhance both accuracy and interpretability. Our experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that GKAN outperforms state-of-the-art GNN models in node classification, link prediction, and graph classification tasks. In addition to the improved accuracy, GKAN's design inherently provides clear insights into the model's decision-making process, eliminating the need for post-hoc explainability techniques. This paper discusses the methodology, performance, and interpretability of GKAN, highlighting its potential for applications in domains where interpretability is crucial.</p></details> |  |

However, discovering reprogramming strategies through classical wet-lab experiments is hindered by lengthy time commitments and high costs. In this study, we explore the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to control Boolean network models of complex biological systems, such as gene regulatory networks and signalling pathway networks. We formulate a novel control problem for Boolean network models under the asynchronous update mode in the context of cellular reprogramming. To facilitate scalability, we consider our previously introduced concept of a pseudo-attractor and we improve our procedure for effective identification of pseudo-attractor states. Finally, we devise a computational framework to solve the control problem. To leverage the structure of biological systems, we incorporate graph neural networks with graph convolutions into the artificial neural network approximator for the action-value function learned by the DRL agent. Experiments on a number of large real-world biological networks from literature demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

The resulting patterns are often neglected by temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs). To formally analyze the expressive power of TGNNs, we lack a generalization of graph isomorphism to temporal graphs that fully captures their causal topology. Addressing this gap, we introduce the notion of consistent event graph isomorphism, which utilizes a time-unfolded representation of time-respecting paths in temporal graphs. We compare this definition with existing notions of temporal graph isomorphisms. We illustrate and highlight the advantages of our approach and develop a temporal generalization of the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm to heuristically distinguish non-isomorphic temporal graphs. Building on this theoretical foundation, we derive a novel message passing scheme for temporal graph neural networks that operates on the event graph representation of temporal graphs. An experimental evaluation shows that our approach performs well in a temporal graph classification experiment.</p></details> |  |

Unlike generic graphs, geometric graphs often exhibit physical symmetries of translations, rotations, and reflections, making them ineffectively processed by current Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To address this issue, researchers proposed a variety of geometric GNNs equipped with invariant/equivariant properties to better characterize the geometry and topology of geometric graphs. Given the current progress in this field, it is imperative to conduct a comprehensive survey of data structures, models, and applications related to geometric GNNs. In this paper, based on the necessary but concise mathematical preliminaries, we formalize geometric graph as the data structure, on top of which we provide a unified view of existing models from the geometric message passing perspective. Additionally, we summarize the applications as well as the related datasets to facilitate later research for methodology development and experimental evaluation. We also discuss the challenges and future potential directions of geometric GNNs at the end of this survey.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The article has been accepted by Frontiers of Computer Science (FCS), with the DOI: {10.1007/s11704-025-41426-w}</p></details> |

Although existing semi-supervised local community detection studies yield promising results, they suffer from time-consuming issues, highlighting the need for more efficient algorithms. Therefore, we apply the "pre-train, prompt" paradigm to semi-supervised local community detection and propose the Pre-trained Prompt-driven Semi-supervised Local community detection method (PPSL). PPSL consists of three main components: node encoding, sample generation, and prompt-driven fine-tuning. Specifically, the node encoding component employs graph neural networks to learn the representations of nodes and communities. Based on representations of nodes and communities, the sample generation component selects known communities that are structurally similar to the local structure of the given node as training samples. Finally, the prompt-driven fine-tuning component leverages these training samples as prompts to guide the final community prediction. Experimental results on five real-world datasets demonstrate that PPSL outperforms baselines in both community quality and efficiency.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

At the heart of these networks are the edges, which are crucial in guiding GNN models' predictions. In many scenarios, these edges represent sensitive information, such as personal associations or financial dealings, which require privacy assurance. However, their contributions to GNN model predictions may, in turn, be exploited by the adversary to compromise their privacy. Motivated by these conflicting requirements, this paper investigates edge privacy in contexts where adversaries possess only black-box access to the target GNN model, restricted further by access controls, preventing direct insights into arbitrary node outputs. Moreover, we are the first to extensively examine situations where the target graph continuously evolves, a common trait of many real-world graphs. In this setting, we present a range of attacks that leverage the message-passing mechanism of GNNs. We evaluated the effectiveness of our attacks using nine real-world datasets, encompassing both static and dynamic graphs, across four different GNN architectures. The results demonstrate that our attack outperforms existing methods across various GNN architectures, consistently achieving an F1 score of at least 0.8 in static scenarios. Furthermore, our attack retains robustness in dynamic graph scenarios, maintaining F1 scores up to 0.8, unlike previous methods that only achieve F1 scores around 0.2.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted to the PoPETs 2025</p></details> |

However, graphs constructed using meta-paths in HGNNs are usually too dense and contain a large number of noise edges. The propagation mechanism of HGNNs propagates even small amounts of noise in a graph to distant neighboring nodes, thereby affecting numerous node embeddings. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel model, named Masked Contrastive Learning (MCL), to enhance recommendation robustness to noise. MCL employs a random masking strategy to augment the graph via meta-paths, reducing node sensitivity to specific neighbors and bolstering embedding robustness. Furthermore, MCL employs contrastive cross-view on a Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) from two perspectives: one-hop neighbors and meta-path neighbors. This approach acquires embeddings capturing both local and high-order structures simultaneously for recommendation. Empirical evaluations on three real-world datasets confirm the superiority of our approach over existing recommendation methods.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Biological Pathway Guided Gene Selection Through Collaborative Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24155v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gene selection in high-dimensional genomic data is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and improving therapeutic outcomes. Traditional feature selection methods effectively identify predictive genes but often ignore complex biological pathways and regulatory networks, leading to unstable and biologically irrelevant signatures. Prior approaches, such as Lasso-based methods and statistical filtering, either focus solely on individual gene-outcome associations or fail to capture pathway-level interactions, presenting a key challenge: how to integrate biological pathway knowledge while maintaining statistical rigor in gene selection? To address this gap, we propose a novel two-stage framework that integrates statistical selection with biological pathway knowledge using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). First, we introduce a pathway-guided pre-filtering strategy that leverages multiple statistical methods alongside KEGG pathway information for initial dimensionality reduction. Next, for refined selection, we model genes as collaborative agents in a MARL framework, where each agent optimizes both predictive power and biological relevance. Our framework incorporates pathway knowledge through Graph Neural Network-based state representations, a reward mechanism combining prediction performance with gene centrality and pathway coverage, and collaborative learning strategies using shared memory and a centralized critic component. Extensive experiments on multiple gene expression datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves both prediction accuracy and biological interpretability compared to traditional methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>31st ...</summary><p>31st SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD 2025)</p></details> |

Building on the Bayesian decision-theoretic framework of Sablayrolles et al., we derive the Bayes-optimal membership inference rule for node-level MIAs against graph neural networks, addressing key open questions about optimal query strategies in the graph setting. We introduce BASE and G-BASE, computationally efficient approximations of the Bayes-optimal attack. G-BASE achieves superior performance compared to previously proposed classifier-based node-level MIA attacks. BASE, which is also applicable to non-graph data, matches or exceeds the performance of prior state-of-the-art MIAs, such as LiRA and RMIA, at a significantly lower computational cost.

While prior research has predominantly focused on learning exact algorithms for polynomial-time-solvable problems, extending NAR to harder problems remains an open challenge.

By leveraging a bipartite representation between primal and dual variables, we establish an alignment between primal-dual algorithms and Graph Neural Networks. Furthermore, we incorporate optimal solutions from small instances to greatly enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. Our empirical results demonstrate that our model not only simulates but also outperforms approximation algorithms for multiple tasks, exhibiting robust generalization to larger and out-of-distribution graphs.
