| **[A Reliable Framework for Human-in-the-Loop Anomaly Detection in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03234v4)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection is a critical machine learning task for numerous applications, such as finance, healthcare, and industrial systems. However, even high-performing models may exhibit potential issues such as biases, leading to unreliable outcomes and misplaced confidence. While model explanation techniques, particularly visual explanations, offer valuable insights by elucidating model attributions of their decision, many limitations still exist -- They are primarily instance-based and not scalable across the dataset, and they provide one-directional information from the model to the human side, lacking a mechanism for users to address detected issues. To fulfill these gaps, we introduce HILAD, a novel framework designed to foster a dynamic and bidirectional collaboration between humans and AI for enhancing anomaly detection models in time series. Through our visual interface, HILAD empowers domain experts to detect, interpret, and correct unexpected model behaviors at scale. Our evaluation through user studies with two models and three time series datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of HILAD, which fosters a deeper model understanding, immediate corrective actions, and model reliability enhancement.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript is currently under review</p></details> |
| **[EXPRTS: Exploring and Probing the Robustness ofTime Series Forecasting Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03508v2)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When deploying time series forecasting models based on machine learning to real world settings, one often encounter situations where the data distribution drifts. Such drifts expose the forecasting models to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and machine learning models lack robustness in these settings. Robustness can be improved by using deep generative models or genetic algorithms to augment time series datasets, but these approaches lack interpretability and are computationally expensive. In this work, we develop an interpretable and simple framework for generating time series. Our method combines time-series decompositions with analytic functions, and is able to generate time series with characteristics matching both in- and out-of-distribution data. This approach allows users to generate new time series in an interpretable fashion, which can be used to augment the dataset and improve forecasting robustness. We demonstrate our framework through EXPRTS, a visual analytics tool designed for univariate time series forecasting models and datasets. Different visualizations of the data distribution, forecasting errors and single time series instances enable users to explore time series datasets, apply transformations, and evaluate forecasting model robustness across diverse scenarios. We show how our framework can generate meaningful OOD time series that improve model robustness, and we validate EXPRTS effectiveness and usability through three use-cases and a user study.</p></details> | under review |
| **[TAMMs: Temporal-Aware Multimodal Model for Satellite Image Change Understanding and Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18862v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite image time-series analysis demands fine-grained spatial-temporal reasoning, which remains a challenge for existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In this work, we study the capabilities of MLLMs on a novel task that jointly targets temporal change understanding and future scene generation, aiming to assess their potential for modeling complex multimodal dynamics over time. We propose TAMMs, a Temporal-Aware Multimodal Model for satellite image change understanding and forecasting, which enhances frozen MLLMs with lightweight temporal modules for structured sequence encoding and contextual prompting. To guide future image generation, TAMMs introduces a Semantic-Fused Control Injection (SFCI) mechanism that adaptively combines high-level semantic reasoning and structural priors within an enhanced ControlNet. This dual-path conditioning enables temporally consistent and semantically grounded image synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that TAMMs outperforms strong MLLM baselines in both temporal change understanding and future image forecasting tasks, highlighting how carefully designed temporal reasoning and semantic fusion can unlock the full potential of MLLMs for spatio-temporal understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the 33rd ACM International Conference on Multimedia.

| **[The Within-Orbit Adaptive Leapfrog No-U-Turn Sampler](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18746v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Locally adapting parameters within Markov chain Monte Carlo methods while preserving reversibility is notoriously difficult. The success of the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) largely stems from its clever local adaptation of the integration time in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo via a geometric U-turn condition. However, posterior distributions frequently exhibit multi-scale geometries with extreme variations in scale, making it necessary to also adapt the leapfrog integrator's step size locally and dynamically. Despite its practical importance, this problem has remained largely open since the introduction of NUTS by Hoffman and Gelman (2014). To address this issue, we introduce the Within-orbit Adaptive Leapfrog No-U-Turn Sampler (WALNUTS), a generalization of NUTS that adapts the leapfrog step size at fixed intervals of simulated time as the orbit evolves. At each interval, the algorithm selects the largest step size from a dyadic schedule that keeps the energy error below a user-specified threshold. Like NUTS, WALNUTS employs biased progressive state selection to favor states with positions that are further from the initial point along the orbit. Empirical evaluations on multiscale target distributions, including Neal's funnel and the Stock-Watson stochastic volatility time-series model, demonstrate that WALNUTS achieves substantial improvements in sampling efficiency and robustness compared to standard NUTS.</p></details> | <details><summary>for c...</summary><p>for companion GitHub repo, see https://github.com/bob-carpenter/walnuts</p></details> |
| **[Self-Normalized Inference in (Quantile, Expected Shortfall) Regressions for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10065v2)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes valid inference tools, based on self-normalization, in time series expected shortfall regressions and, as a corollary, also in quantile regressions. Extant methods for such time series regressions, based on a bootstrap or direct estimation of the long-run variance, are computationally more involved, require the choice of tuning parameters and have serious size distortions when the regression errors are strongly serially dependent. In contrast, our inference tools only require estimates of the (quantile, expected shortfall) regression parameters that are computed on an expanding window, and are correctly sized as we show in simulations. Two empirical applications to stock return predictability and to Growth-at-Risk demonstrate the practical usefulness of the developed inference tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Study of Dynamic Stock Relationship Modeling and S&P500 Price Forecasting Based on Differential Graph Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18717v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stock price prediction is vital for investment decisions and risk management, yet remains challenging due to markets' nonlinear dynamics and time-varying inter-stock correlations. Traditional static-correlation models fail to capture evolving stock relationships. To address this, we propose a Differential Graph Transformer (DGT) framework for dynamic relationship modeling and price prediction. Our DGT integrates sequential graph structure changes into multi-head self-attention via a differential graph mechanism, adaptively preserving high-value connections while suppressing noise. Causal temporal attention captures global/local dependencies in price sequences. We further evaluate correlation metrics (Pearson, Mutual Information, Spearman, Kendall's Tau) across global/local/dual scopes as spatial-attention priors. Using 10 years of S&P 500 closing prices (z-score normalized; 64-day sliding windows), DGT with spatial priors outperformed GRU baselines (RMSE: 0.24 vs. 0.87). Kendall's Tau global matrices yielded optimal results (MAE: 0.11). K-means clustering revealed "high-volatility growth" and "defensive blue-chip" stocks, with the latter showing lower errors (RMSE: 0.13) due to stable correlations. Kendall's Tau and Mutual Information excelled in volatile sectors. This study innovatively combines differential graph structures with Transformers, validating dynamic relationship modeling and identifying optimal correlation metrics/scopes. Clustering analysis supports tailored quantitative strategies. Our framework advances financial time-series prediction through dynamic modeling and cross-asset interaction analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resampling Augmentation for Time Series Contrastive Learning: Application to Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18587v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the abundance of unlabeled Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) and the scarcity of labeled data, contrastive self-supervised pretraining emerges as a natural tool to leverage this vast quantity of unlabeled data. However, designing effective data augmentations for contrastive learning remains challenging for time series. We introduce a novel resampling-based augmentation strategy that generates positive pairs by upsampling time series and extracting disjoint subsequences while preserving temporal coverage. We validate our approach on multiple agricultural classification benchmarks using Sentinel-2 imagery, showing that it outperforms common alternatives such as jittering, resizing, and masking. Further, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the S2-Agri100 dataset without employing spatial information or temporal encodings, surpassing more complex masked-based SSL frameworks. Our method offers a simple, yet effective, contrastive learning augmentation for remote sensing time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures, accepted at 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025) Terrabytes workshop</p></details> |
| **[Indeterminate Probability Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11536v2)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex continuous or mixed joint distributions (e.g., P(Y | z_1, z_2, ..., z_N)) generally lack closed-form solutions, often necessitating approximations such as MCMC. This paper proposes Indeterminate Probability Theory (IPT), which makes the following contributions: (1) An observer-centered framework in which experimental outcomes are represented as distributions combining ground truth with observation error; (2) The introduction of three independence candidate axioms that enable a two-phase probabilistic inference framework; (3) The derivation of closed-form solutions for arbitrary complex joint distributions under this framework. Both the Indeterminate Probability Neural Network (IPNN) model and the non-neural multivariate time series forecasting application demonstrate IPT's effectiveness in modeling high-dimensional distributions, with successful validation up to 1000 dimensions. Importantly, IPT is consistent with classical probability theory and subsumes the frequentist equation in the limit of vanishing observation error.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[A scalable estimator of high-order information in complex dynamical systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18498v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our understanding of neural systems rests on our ability to characterise how they perform distributed computation and integrate information. Advances in information theory have introduced several quantities to describe complex information structures, where collective patterns of coordination emerge from high-order (i.e. beyond-pairwise) interdependencies. Unfortunately, the use of these approaches to study large neural systems is severely hindered by the poor scalability of existing techniques. Moreover, there are relatively few measures specifically designed for multivariate time series data. Here we introduce a novel measure of information about macroscopic structures, termed M-information, which quantifies the high-order integration of information in complex dynamical systems. We show that M-information can be calculated via a convex optimisation problem, and we derive a robust and efficient algorithm that scales gracefully with system size. Our analyses show that M-information is resilient to noise, indexes critical behaviour in artificial neuronal populations, and reflects task performance in real-world mouse brain activity data. Furthermore, M-information can be incorporated into existing information decomposition frameworks to reveal a comprehensive taxonomy of information dynamics. Taken together, these results help us unravel collective computation in complex neural systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures + appendix</p></details> |
| **[FREQuency ATTribution: Benchmarking Frequency-based Occlusion for Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18481v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks are among the most successful algorithms in terms of performance and scalability in different domains. However, since these networks are black boxes, their usability is severely restricted due to the lack of interpretability. Existing interpretability methods do not address the analysis of time-series-based networks specifically enough. This paper shows that an analysis in the frequency domain can not only highlight relevant areas in the input signal better than existing methods, but is also more robust to fluctuations in the signal. In this paper, FreqATT is presented, a framework that enables post-hoc networks to interpret time series analysis. To achieve this, the relevant different frequencies are evaluated and the signal is either filtered or the relevant input data is marked.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[RePST: Language Model Empowered Spatio-Temporal Forecasting via Semantic-Oriented Reprogramming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14505v3)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is pivotal in numerous real-world applications, including transportation planning, energy management, and climate monitoring. In this work, we aim to harness the reasoning and generalization abilities of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for more effective spatio-temporal forecasting, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. However, recent studies uncover that PLMs, which are primarily trained on textual data, often falter when tasked with modeling the intricate correlations in numerical time series, thereby limiting their effectiveness in comprehending spatio-temporal data. To bridge the gap, we propose RePST, a semantic-oriented PLM reprogramming framework tailored for spatio-temporal forecasting. Specifically, we first propose a semantic-oriented decomposer that adaptively disentangles spatially correlated time series into interpretable sub-components, which facilitates PLM to understand sophisticated spatio-temporal dynamics via a divide-and-conquer strategy. Moreover, we propose a selective discrete reprogramming scheme, which introduces an expanded spatio-temporal vocabulary space to project spatio-temporal series into discrete representations. This scheme minimizes the information loss during reprogramming and enriches the representations derived by PLMs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed RePST outperforms twelve state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly in data-scarce scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness and superior generalization capabilities of PLMs for spatio-temporal forecasting.

| **[A Transformer-Based Approach for Diagnosing Fault Cases in Optical Fiber Amplifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06245v2)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A transformer-based deep learning approach is presented that enables the diagnosis of fault cases in optical fiber amplifiers using condition-based monitoring time series data. The model, Inverse Triple-Aspect Self-Attention Transformer (ITST), uses an encoder-decoder architecture, utilizing three feature extraction paths in the encoder, feature-engineered data for the decoder and a self-attention mechanism. The results show that ITST outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of classification accuracy, which enables predictive maintenance for optical fiber amplifiers, reducing network downtimes and maintenance costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the 25th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON) 2025</p></details> |
| **[BrainSymphony: A Transformer-Driven Fusion of fMRI Time Series and Structural Connectivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18314v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing foundation models for neuroimaging are often prohibitively large and data-intensive. We introduce BrainSymphony, a lightweight, parameter-efficient foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance while being pre-trained on significantly smaller public datasets. BrainSymphony's strong multimodal architecture processes functional MRI data through parallel spatial and temporal transformer streams, which are then efficiently distilled into a unified representation by a Perceiver module. Concurrently, it models structural connectivity from diffusion MRI using a novel signed graph transformer to encode the brain's anatomical structure. These powerful, modality-specific representations are then integrated via an adaptive fusion gate. Despite its compact design, our model consistently outperforms larger models on a diverse range of downstream benchmarks, including classification, prediction, and unsupervised network identification tasks. Furthermore, our model revealed novel insights into brain dynamics using attention maps on a unique external psilocybin neuroimaging dataset (pre- and post-administration). BrainSymphony establishes that architecturally-aware, multimodal models can surpass their larger counterparts, paving the way for more accessible and powerful research in computational neuroscience.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |
| **[STACT-Time: Spatio-Temporal Cross Attention for Cine Thyroid Ultrasound Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18172v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thyroid cancer is among the most common cancers in the United States. Thyroid nodules are frequently detected through ultrasound (US) imaging, and some require further evaluation via fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. Despite its effectiveness, FNA often leads to unnecessary biopsies of benign nodules, causing patient discomfort and anxiety. To address this, the American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) has been developed to reduce benign biopsies. However, such systems are limited by interobserver variability. Recent deep learning approaches have sought to improve risk stratification, but they often fail to utilize the rich temporal and spatial context provided by US cine clips, which contain dynamic global information and surrounding structural changes across various views. In this work, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Cross Attention for Cine Thyroid Ultrasound Time Series Classification (STACT-Time) model, a novel representation learning framework that integrates imaging features from US cine clips with features from segmentation masks automatically generated by a pretrained model. By leveraging self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms, our model captures the rich temporal and spatial context of US cine clips while enhancing feature representation through segmentation-guided learning. Our model improves malignancy prediction compared to state-of-the-art models, achieving a cross-validation precision of 0.91 (plus or minus 0.02) and an F1 score of 0.89 (plus or minus 0.02). By reducing unnecessary biopsies of benign nodules while maintaining high sensitivity for malignancy detection, our model has the potential to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[TAB: Unified Benchmarking of Time Series Anomaly Detection Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18046v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) plays an important role in many domains such as finance, transportation, and healthcare. With the ongoing instrumentation of reality, more time series data will be available, leading also to growing demands for TSAD. While many TSAD methods already exist, new and better methods are still desirable. However, effective progress hinges on the availability of reliable means of evaluating new methods and comparing them with existing methods. We address deficiencies in current evaluation procedures related to datasets and experimental settings and protocols. Specifically, we propose a new time series anomaly detection benchmark, called TAB. First, TAB encompasses 29 public multivariate datasets and 1,635 univariate time series from different domains to facilitate more comprehensive evaluations on diverse datasets. Second, TAB covers a variety of TSAD methods, including Non-learning, Machine learning, Deep learning, LLM-based, and Time-series pre-trained methods. Third, TAB features a unified and automated evaluation pipeline that enables fair and easy evaluation of TSAD methods. Finally, we employ TAB to evaluate existing TSAD methods and report on the outcomes, thereby offering a deeper insight into the performance of these methods. Besides, all datasets and code are available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/TAB.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by PVLDB2025</p></details> |
| **[Constructing prediction intervals for the age distribution of deaths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17953v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a model-agnostic procedure to construct prediction intervals for the age distribution of deaths. The age distribution of deaths is an example of constrained data, which are nonnegative and have a constrained integral. A centered log-ratio transformation and a cumulative distribution function transformation are used to remove the two constraints, where the latter transformation can also handle the presence of zero counts. Our general procedure divides data samples into training, validation, and testing sets. Within the validation set, we can select an optimal tuning parameter by calibrating the empirical coverage probabilities to be close to their nominal ones. With the selected optimal tuning parameter, we then construct the pointwise prediction intervals using the same models for the holdout data in the testing set. Using Japanese age- and sex-specific life-table death counts, we assess and evaluate the interval forecast accuracy with a suite of functional time-series models.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Stylized Facts of High-Frequency Bitcoin Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11930v2)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper analyses the high-frequency intraday Bitcoin dataset from 2019 to 2022. During this time frame, the Bitcoin market index exhibited two distinct periods, 2019-20 and 2021-22, characterized by an abrupt change in volatility. The Bitcoin price returns for both periods can be described by an anomalous diffusion process, transitioning from subdiffusion for short intervals to weak superdiffusion over longer time intervals. The characteristic features related to this anomalous behavior studied in the present paper include heavy tails, which can be described using a $q$-Gaussian distribution and correlations. When we sample the autocorrelation of absolute returns, we observe a power-law relationship, indicating time dependence in both periods initially. The ensemble autocorrelation of the returns decays rapidly. We fitted the autocorrelation with a power law to capture the decay and found that the second period experienced a slightly higher decay rate. The further study involves the analysis of endogenous effects within the Bitcoin time series, which are examined through detrending analysis. We found that both periods are multifractal and present self-similarity in the detrended probability density function (PDF). The Hurst exponent over short time intervals shifts from less than 0.5 ($\sim$ 0.42) in Period 1 to closer to 0.5 in Period 2 ($\sim$ 0.49), indicating that the market has gained efficiency over time.</p></details> | 21 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Fetuses Made Simple: Modeling and Tracking of Fetal Shape and Pose](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17858v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing fetal body motion and shape is paramount in prenatal diagnostics and monitoring. Existing methods for fetal MRI analysis mainly rely on anatomical keypoints or volumetric body segmentations. Keypoints simplify body structure to facilitate motion analysis, but may ignore important details of full-body shape. Body segmentations capture complete shape information but complicate temporal analysis due to large non-local fetal movements. To address these limitations, we construct a 3D articulated statistical fetal body model based on the Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model (SMPL). Our algorithm iteratively estimates body pose in the image space and body shape in the canonical pose space. This approach improves robustness to MRI motion artifacts and intensity distortions, and reduces the impact of incomplete surface observations due to challenging fetal poses. We train our model on segmentations and keypoints derived from $19,816$ MRI volumes across $53$ subjects. Our model captures body shape and motion across time series and provides intuitive visualization. Furthermore, it enables automated anthropometric measurements traditionally difficult to obtain from segmentations and keypoints. When tested on unseen fetal body shapes, our method yields a surface alignment error of $3.2$ mm for $3$ mm MRI voxel size. To our knowledge, this represents the first 3D articulated statistical fetal body model, paving the way for enhanced fetal motion and shape analysis in prenatal diagnostics. The code is available at https://github.com/MedicalVisionGroup/fetal-smpl .</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Glucose Level Prediction of ICU Patients through Hierarchical Modeling of Irregular Time-Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01418v3)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting blood glucose (BG) levels of ICU patients is critical, as both hypoglycemia (BG < 70 mg/dL) and hyperglycemia (BG > 180 mg/dL) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This study presents a proof-of-concept machine learning framework, the Multi-source Irregular Time-Series Transformer (MITST), designed to predict BG levels in ICU patients. In contrast to existing methods that rely heavily on manual feature engineering or utilize limited Electronic Health Record (EHR) data sources, MITST integrates diverse clinical data--including laboratory results, medications, and vital signs without predefined aggregation. The model leverages a hierarchical Transformer architecture, designed to capture interactions among features within individual timestamps, temporal dependencies across different timestamps, and semantic relationships across multiple data sources. Evaluated using the extensive eICU database (200,859 ICU stays across 208 hospitals), MITST achieves a statistically significant ( p < 0.001 ) average improvement of 1.7 percentage points (pp) in AUROC and 1.8 pp in AUPRC over a state-of-the-art random forest baseline. Crucially, for hypoglycemia--a rare but life-threatening condition--MITST increases sensitivity by 7.2 pp, potentially enabling hundreds of earlier interventions across ICU populations. The flexible architecture of MITST allows seamless integration of new data sources without retraining the entire model, enhancing its adaptability for clinical decision support. While this study focuses on predicting BG levels, we also demonstrate MITST's ability to generalize to a distinct clinical task (in-hospital mortality prediction), highlighting its potential for broader applicability in ICU settings. MITST thus offers a robust and extensible solution for analyzing complex, multi-source, irregular time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 7 figures V3: Revised significantly.

| **[Recursive Gaussian Process State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14679v2)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning dynamical models from data is not only fundamental but also holds great promise for advancing principle discovery, time-series prediction, and controller design. Among various approaches, Gaussian Process State-Space Models (GPSSMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their combination of flexibility and interpretability. However, for online learning, the field lacks an efficient method suitable for scenarios where prior information regarding data distribution and model function is limited. To address this issue, this paper proposes a recursive GPSSM method with adaptive capabilities for both operating domains and Gaussian process (GP) hyperparameters. Specifically, we first utilize first-order linearization to derive a Bayesian update equation for the joint distribution between the system state and the GP model, enabling closed-form and domain-independent learning. Second, an online selection algorithm for inducing points is developed based on informative criteria to achieve lightweight learning. Third, to support online hyperparameter optimization, we recover historical measurement information from the current filtering distribution. Comprehensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability of our method compared to state-of-the-art online GPSSM techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model-Agnostic, Temperature-Informed Sampling Enhances Cross-Year Crop Mapping with Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12885v2)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional benchmarks for crop type classification from optical satellite time series typically assume access to labeled data from the same year and rely on fixed calendar-day sampling. This limits generalization across seasons, where crop phenology shifts due to interannual climate variability, and precludes real-time application when current-year labels are unavailable. Furthermore, uncertainty quantification is often neglected, making such approaches unreliable for crop monitoring applications. Inspired by ecophysiological principles of plant growth, we propose a simple, model-agnostic sampling strategy that leverages growing degree days (GDD), based on daily average temperature, to replace calendar time with thermal time. By uniformly subsampling time series in this biologically meaningful domain, the method emphasizes phenologically active growth stages while reducing temporal redundancy and noise. We evaluate the method on a multi-year Sentinel-2 dataset spanning all of Switzerland, training on one growing season and testing on other seasons. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method delivers substantial gains in classification accuracy and, critically, produces more calibrated uncertainty estimates. Notably, our method excels in low-data regimes and enables significantly more accurate early-season classification. With only 10 percent of the training data, our method surpasses the state-of-the-art baseline in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty estimation, and by the end of June, it achieves performance similar to a baseline trained on the full season. These results demonstrate that leveraging temperature data not only improves predictive performance across seasons but also enhances the robustness and trustworthiness of crop-type mapping in real-world applications.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Gaussian Process Latent Variable Modeling for Few-shot Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10306v2)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate time series forecasting is crucial for optimizing resource allocation, industrial production, and urban management, particularly with the growth of cyber-physical and IoT systems. However, limited training sample availability in fields like physics and biology poses significant challenges. Existing models struggle to capture long-term dependencies and to model diverse meta-knowledge explicitly in few-shot scenarios. To address these issues, we propose MetaGP, a meta-learning-based Gaussian process latent variable model that uses a Gaussian process kernel function to capture long-term dependencies and to maintain strong correlations in time series. We also introduce Kernel Association Search (KAS) as a novel meta-learning component to explicitly model meta-knowledge, thereby enhancing both interpretability and prediction accuracy. We study MetaGP on simulated and real-world few-shot datasets, showing that it is capable of state-of-the-art prediction accuracy. We also find that MetaGP can capture long-term dependencies and can model meta-knowledge, thereby providing valuable insights into complex time series patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Machine Learning Algorithms using Path Signatures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17634v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interface between stochastic analysis and machine learning is a rapidly evolving field, with path signatures - iterated integrals that provide faithful, hierarchical representations of paths - offering a principled and universal feature map for sequential and structured data. Rooted in rough path theory, path signatures are invariant to reparameterization and well-suited for modelling evolving dynamics, long-range dependencies, and irregular sampling - common challenges in real-world time series and graph data. This thesis investigates how to harness the expressive power of path signatures within scalable machine learning pipelines. It introduces a suite of models that combine theoretical robustness with computational efficiency, bridging rough path theory with probabilistic modelling, deep learning, and kernel methods. Key contributions include: Gaussian processes with signature kernel-based covariance functions for uncertainty-aware time series modelling; the Seq2Tens framework, which employs low-rank tensor structure in the weight space for scalable deep modelling of long-range dependencies; and graph-based models where expected signatures over graphs induce hypo-elliptic diffusion processes, offering expressive yet tractable alternatives to standard graph neural networks. Further developments include Random Fourier Signature Features, a scalable kernel approximation with theoretical guarantees, and Recurrent Sparse Spectrum Signature Gaussian Processes, which combine Gaussian processes, signature kernels, and random features with a principled forgetting mechanism for multi-horizon time series forecasting with adaptive context length. We hope this thesis serves as both a methodological toolkit and a conceptual bridge, and provides a useful reference for the current state of the art in scalable, signature-based learning for sequential and structured data.</p></details> | PhD thesis |

Although deep learning-based methods have achieved remarkable progress, they still exhibit suboptimal performance in long-term forecasting and data-scarce scenarios. Recent research demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) achieve promising performance in time series forecasting. However, we find existing LLM-based methods still have shortcomings: (1) the absence of a unified paradigm for textual prompt formulation and (2) the neglect of modality discrepancies between textual prompts and time series. To address this, we propose LLM-Prompt, an LLM-based time series forecasting framework integrating multi-prompt information and cross-modal semantic alignment. Specifically, we first construct a unified textual prompt paradigm containing learnable soft prompts and textualized hard prompts. Second, to enhance LLMs' comprehensive understanding of the forecasting task, we design a semantic space embedding and cross-modal alignment module to achieve cross-modal fusion of temporal and textual information. Finally, the transformed time series from the LLMs are projected to obtain the forecasts. Comprehensive evaluations on 6 public datasets and 3 carbon emission datasets demonstrate that LLM-Prompt is a powerful framework for time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |

While Transformer-based models have demonstrated strong performance in modeling the temporal dynamics of dense trajectories of humans and vehicles in smart cities, they usually lack access to broader contextual knowledge that enhances the forecasting reliability of sparse meteorological trajectories, such as typhoon tracks. To address this challenge, we propose TyphoFormer, a novel framework that incorporates natural language descriptions as auxiliary prompts to improve typhoon trajectory forecasting. For each time step, we use Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise textual descriptions based on the numerical attributes recorded in the North Atlantic hurricane database. The language descriptions capture high-level meteorological semantics and are embedded as auxiliary special tokens prepended to the numerical time series input. By integrating both textual and sequential information within a unified Transformer encoder, TyphoFormer enables the model to leverage contextual cues that are otherwise inaccessible through numerical features alone. Extensive experiments are conducted on HURDAT2 benchmark, results show that TyphoFormer consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly under challenging scenarios involving nonlinear path shifts and limited historical observations.</p></details> |  |

Three weather-dependent models are used to create the hourly wind power productions, solar power productions, and dynamic line ratings respectively. The actual historical weather information is also provided along with this dataset, which is suitable for machine learning models. Security-constrained unit commitment is conducted on TX-123BT daily grid profiles and numerical results are compared with the actual Texas system for validation. The created hourly DLR profiles can cut operating cost from USD 8.09 M to USD 7.95 M (-1.7 %), raises renewable dispatch by 1.3 %, and lowers average LMPs from USD 18.66 to USD 17.98 /MWh (-3.6 %). Two hydrogen options -- a 200 MW dual hub and a 500 MW hydrogen-energy transmission and conversion system -- reduce high-load Q3 daily costs by 13.9 % and 14.1 %, respectively. Sensitivity tests show that suppressing the high-resolution weather-driven profiles can push system cost up by as much as 15 %, demonstrating the economic weight of temporal detail.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 14 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[When can isotropy help adapt LLMs' next word prediction to numerical domains?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17135v4)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vector representations of contextual embeddings learned by pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are effective in various downstream tasks in numerical domains such as time series forecasting. Despite their significant benefits, the tendency of LLMs to hallucinate in such domains can have severe consequences in applications such as energy, nature, finance, healthcare, retail and transportation, among others. To guarantee prediction reliability and accuracy in numerical domains, it is necessary to open the black box behind the LLM and provide performance guarantees through explanation. However, there is little theoretical understanding of when pre-trained language models help solve numerical downstream tasks. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by understanding when the next-word prediction capability of LLMs can be adapted to numerical domains through a novel analysis based on the concept of isotropy in the contextual embedding space. Specifically, a log-linear model for LLMs is considered in which numerical data can be predicted from its context through a network with softmax in the output layer of LLMs (i.e., language model head in self-attention). For this model, it is demonstrated that, in order to achieve state-of-the-art performance in numerical domains, the hidden representations of the LLM embeddings must possess a structure that accounts for the shift-invariance of the softmax function. By formulating a gradient structure of self-attention in pre-trained models, it is shown how the isotropic property of LLM embeddings in contextual embedding space preserves the underlying structure of representations, thereby resolving the shift-invariance problem and providing a performance guarantee. Experiments show that different characteristics of numerical data and model architectures have different impacts on isotropy, and this variability directly affects the performances.</p></details> |  |

While Bayesian inference under the BM approach has been widely studied in the independence setting, no asymptotic theory currently exists for time series. Further results are needed to establish that BM method can be applied with the kind of dependent time series models relevant to applied fields. To address this gap we first establish a comprehensive likelihood theory for the misspecified Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) model under serial dependence. Our results include uniform convergence of the empirical log-likelihood process, contraction rates for the Maximum Likelihood Estimator, and a local asymptotically Gaussian expansion. Building on this foundation, we develop the asymptotic theory of Bayesian inference for the GEV parameters, the extremal index, $T$-time-horizon return levels, and extreme quantiles (Value at Risk). Under general conditions on the prior, we prove posterior consistency, $\sqrt{k}$-contraction rates, Bernstein-von Mises theorems, and asymptotic coverage properties for credible intervals. For inference on the extremal index, we propose an adjusted posterior distribution that corrects for poor coverage exhibited by a naive Bayesian approach. Simulations show excellent inferential performances for the proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |

The method consists of three steps: (1) using Adaptive Empirical Pattern Transformation (ADEPT), a highly specific method to identify walking; (2) transforming the accelerometry time series into an image that corresponds to the joint distribution of the time series and its lags; and (3) using the resulting images to construct a person-specific walking fingerprint. The method is applied to 15,000 individuals from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) with up to 7 days of wrist accelerometry data collected at 80 Hertz. The resulting dataset contains more than 10 terabytes, is roughly 2 to 3 orders of magnitude larger than previous datasets used for activity recognition, is collected in the free living environment, and does not contain labels for walking periods. Using extensive cross-validation studies, we show that our method is highly predictive and can be successfully extended to a large, heterogeneous sample representative of the U.S. population: in the highest-performing model, the correct participant is in the top 1% of predictions 96% of the time.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

Many such time series exhibit multiple regimes, i.e., consecutive temporal segments with a priori unknown boundaries, with each regime having its own causal structure. Inferring causal dependencies and regime shifts is critical for analyzing the underlying processes. However, causal structure learning in this setting is challenging due to (1) non stationarity, i.e., each regime can have its own causal graph and mixing function, and (2) complex noise distributions, which may be non Gaussian or heteroscedastic. Existing causal discovery approaches cannot address these challenges, since generally assume stationarity or Gaussian noise with constant variance. Hence, we introduce FANTOM, a unified framework for causal discovery that handles non stationary processes along with non Gaussian and heteroscedastic noises. FANTOM simultaneously infers the number of regimes and their corresponding indices and learns each regime's Directed Acyclic Graph. It uses a Bayesian Expectation Maximization algorithm that maximizes the evidence lower bound of the data log likelihood. On the theoretical side, we prove, under mild assumptions, that temporal heteroscedastic causal models, introduced in FANTOM's formulation, are identifiable in both stationary and non stationary settings. In addition, extensive experiments on synthetic and real data show that FANTOM outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Many methods operate on the frequency-domain, relying on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) which assumes uniform sampling, therefore requiring prior interpolation that can distort the spectra. To address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable Lomb--Scargle layer that enables a reliable computation of the power spectrum of irregularly sampled data. We integrate this layer into a novel score-based diffusion model (LSCD) for time series imputation conditioned on the entire signal spectrum. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method recovers missing data more accurately than purely time-domain baselines, while simultaneously producing consistent frequency estimates. Crucially, our method can be easily integrated into learning frameworks, enabling broader adoption of spectral guidance in machine learning approaches involving incomplete or irregular data.</p></details> | In ICML 2025 |
| **[Bayesian Joint Model of Multi-Sensor and Failure Event Data for Multi-Mode Failure Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17036v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern industrial systems are often subject to multiple failure modes, and their conditions are monitored by multiple sensors, generating multiple time-series signals. Additionally, time-to-failure data are commonly available. Accurately predicting a system's remaining useful life (RUL) requires effectively leveraging multi-sensor time-series data alongside multi-mode failure event data. In most existing models, failure modes and RUL prediction are performed independently, ignoring the inherent relationship between these two tasks. Some models integrate multiple failure modes and event prediction using black-box machine learning approaches, which lack statistical rigor and cannot characterize the inherent uncertainty in the model and data. This paper introduces a unified approach to jointly model the multi-sensor time-series data and failure time concerning multiple failure modes. This proposed model integrate a Cox proportional hazards model, a Convolved Multi-output Gaussian Process, and multinomial failure mode distributions in a hierarchical Bayesian framework with corresponding priors, enabling accurate prediction with robust uncertainty quantification. Posterior distributions are effectively obtained by Variational Bayes, and prediction is performed with Monte Carlo sampling. The advantages of the proposed model is validated through extensive numerical and case studies with jet-engine dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoIFNet: A Unified Framework for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Missing Values](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13064v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) is a critical task with broad applications in domains such as meteorology, transportation, and economics. Nevertheless, pervasive missing values caused by sensor failures or human errors significantly degrade forecasting accuracy. Prior efforts usually employ an impute-then-forecast paradigm, leading to suboptimal predictions due to error accumulation and misaligned objectives between the two stages. To address this challenge, we propose the Collaborative Imputation-Forecasting Network (CoIFNet), a novel framework that unifies imputation and forecasting to achieve robust MTSF in the presence of missing values. Specifically, CoIFNet takes the observed values, mask matrix and timestamp embeddings as input, processing them sequentially through the Cross-Timestep Fusion (CTF) and Cross-Variate Fusion (CVF) modules to capture temporal dependencies that are robust to missing values. We provide theoretical justifications on how our CoIFNet learning objective improves the performance bound of MTSF with missing values. Through extensive experiments on challenging MSTF benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our proposed approach across diverse missing-data scenarios, e.g., CoIFNet outperforms the state-of-the-art method by $\underline{\textbf{24.40}}$% ($\underline{\textbf{23.81}}$%) at a point (block) missing rate of 0.6, while improving memory and time efficiency by $\underline{\boldsymbol{4.3\times}}$ and $\underline{\boldsymbol{2.1\times}}$, respectively.

| **[Autoregressive Hypergraph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16966v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional graph representations are insufficient for modelling real-world phenomena involving multi-entity interactions, such as collaborative projects or protein complexes, necessitating the use of hypergraphs. While hypergraphs preserve the intrinsic nature of such complex relationships, existing models often overlook temporal evolution in relational data. To address this, we introduce a first-order autoregressive (i.e. AR(1)) model for dynamic non-uniform hypergraphs. This is the first dynamic hypergraph model with provable theoretical guarantees, explicitly defining the temporal evolution of hyperedge presence through transition probabilities that govern persistence and change dynamics. This framework provides closed-form expressions for key probabilistic properties and facilitates straightforward maximum-likelihood inference with uniform error bounds and asymptotic normality, along with a permutation-based diagnostic test. We also consider an AR(1) hypergraph stochastic block model (HSBM), where a novel Laplacian enables exact and efficient latent community recovery via a spectral clustering algorithm. Furthermore, we develop a likelihood-based change-point estimator for the HSBM to detect structural breaks within the time series. The efficacy and practical value of our methods are comprehensively demonstrated through extensive simulation studies and compelling applications to a primary school interaction data set and the Enron email corpus, revealing insightful community structures and significant temporal changes.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2010.04492</p></details> |

Learning similarities among multiple time series is a crucial problem since it serves as the foundation for downstream analysis. Due to the complex temporal dynamics of the event-triggered time series, it often remains unclear which similarity metric is appropriate for security-related tasks, such as anomaly detection and clustering. The overarching goal of this paper is to develop an unsupervised learning framework that is capable of learning similarities among a set of event-triggered time series. From the machine learning vantage point, the proposed framework harnesses the power of both hierarchical multi-resolution sequential autoencoders and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to effectively learn the low-dimensional representations from the time series. Finally, the obtained similarity measure can be easily visualized for the explanation. The proposed framework aspires to offer a stepping stone that gives rise to a systematic approach to model and learn similarities among a multitude of event-triggered time series. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, it is revealed that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods considerably.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 14 figures.

The quasi-periodic signals generated by these objects often follow a similar repetitive and periodic pattern, but have variations in the period, and come in different lengths caused by timing (synchronization) errors. Given a multitude of such quasi-periodic time series, can we build machine learning models to identify those time series that behave differently from the majority of the observations? In addition, can the models help human experts to understand how the decision was made? We propose a sequence to Gaussian Mixture Model (seq2GMM) framework. The overarching goal of this framework is to identify unusual and interesting time series within a network time series database. We further develop a surrogate-based optimization algorithm that can efficiently train the seq2GMM model. Seq2GMM exhibits strong empirical performance on a plurality of public benchmark datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques by a significant margin. We also theoretically analyze the convergence property of the proposed training algorithm and provide numerical results to substantiate our theoretical claims.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering</p></details> |

While existing methods primarily focus on developing model structures and building graphs for improved selection, pre-training strategies remain underexplored in this domain. Current stock series pre-training follows methods from other areas without adapting to the unique characteristics of financial data, particularly overlooking stock-specific contextual information and the non-stationary nature of stock prices. Consequently, the latent statistical features inherent in stock data are underutilized. In this paper, we propose three novel pre-training tasks tailored to stock data characteristics: stock code classification, stock sector classification, and moving average prediction. We develop the Stock Specialized Pre-trained Transformer (SSPT) based on a two-layer transformer architecture. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our pre-training methods and provide detailed guidance on their application. Evaluations on five stock datasets, including four markets and two time periods, demonstrate that SSPT consistently outperforms the market and existing methods in terms of both cumulative investment return ratio and Sharpe ratio. Additionally, our experiments on simulated data investigate the underlying mechanisms of our methods, providing insights into understanding price series.

| **[Transfer entropy for finite data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16215v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transfer entropy is a widely used measure for quantifying directed information flows in complex systems. While the challenges of estimating transfer entropy for continuous data are well known, it has two major shortcomings that persist even for data of finite cardinality: it exhibits a substantial positive bias for sparse bin counts, and it has no clear means to assess statistical significance. By more precisely accounting for information content in finite data streams, we derive a transfer entropy measure which is asymptotically equivalent to the standard plug-in estimator but remedies these issues for time series of small size and/or high cardinality, permitting a fully nonparametric assessment of statistical significance without simulation. We show that this correction for finite data has a substantial impact on results in both real and synthetic time series datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Principal Components Analysis for Stationary Functional Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02343v3)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional time series (FTS) data have become increasingly available in real-world applications. Research on such data typically focuses on two objectives: curve reconstruction and forecasting, both of which require efficient dimension reduction. While functional principal component analysis (FPCA) serves as a standard tool, existing methods often fail to achieve simultaneous parsimony and optimality in dimension reduction, thereby restricting their practical implementation. To address this limitation, we propose a novel notion termed optimal functional filters, which unifies and enhances conventional FPCA methodologies. Specifically, we establish connections among diverse FPCA approaches through a dependence-adaptive representer for stationary FTS. Building on this theoretical foundation, we develop an estimation procedure for optimal functional filters that enables both dimension reduction and prediction within a Bayesian modeling framework. Theoretical properties are established for the proposed methodology, and comprehensive simulation studies validate its superiority over competing approaches. We further illustrate our method through an application to reconstructing and forecasting daily air pollutant concentration trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Regularized Learning for Fractional Brownian Motion via Path Signatures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16156v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) extends classical Brownian motion by introducing dependence between increments, governed by the Hurst parameter $H\in (0,1)$. Unlike traditional Brownian motion, the increments of an fBm are not independent. Paths generated by fractional Brownian motions can exhibit significant irregularity, particularly when the Hurst parameter is small. As a result, classical regression methods may not perform effectively. Signatures, defined as iterated path integrals of continuous and discrete-time processes, offer a universal nonlinearity property that simplifies the challenge of feature selection in time series data analysis by effectively linearizing it. Consequently, we employ Lasso regression techniques for regularization when handling irregular data. To evaluate the performance of signature Lasso on fractional Brownian motion (fBM), we study its consistency when the Hurst parameter $ H \ne \frac{1}{2} $. This involves deriving bounds on the first and second moments of the signature. For the case $ H > \frac{1}{2} $, we use the signature defined in the Young sense, while for $ H < \frac{1}{2} $, we use the Stratonovich interpretation. Simulation results indicate that signature Lasso can outperform traditional regression methods for synthetic data as well as for real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

We introduce AutoHFormer, a hierarchical autoregressive transformer that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: 1) Hierarchical Temporal Modeling: Our architecture decomposes predictions into segment-level blocks processed in parallel, followed by intra-segment sequential refinement. This dual-scale approach maintains temporal coherence while enabling efficient computation. 2) Dynamic Windowed Attention: The attention mechanism employs learnable causal windows with exponential decay, reducing complexity while preserving precise temporal relationships. This design avoids both the anti-causal violations of standard transformers and the sequential bottlenecks of RNN hybrids. 3) Adaptive Temporal Encoding: a novel position encoding system is adopted to capture time patterns at multiple scales. It combines fixed oscillating patterns for short-term variations with learnable decay rates for long-term trends. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AutoHFormer 10.76X faster training and 6.06X memory reduction compared to PatchTST on PEMS08, while maintaining consistent accuracy across 96-720 step horizons in most of cases. These breakthroughs establish new benchmarks for efficient and precise time series modeling.

Such changes may occur due to expected shifts in the data distribution, i.e., concept drift, or unexpected anomalous changes. The presence of concept drift poses challenges for anomaly detection in time series. While anomalies are caused by undesirable changes in the data, differentiating abnormal changes from varying normal behaviours is difficult due to differing frequencies of occurrence, varying time intervals when normal patterns occur. Differentiating between concept drift and anomalies is critical for accurate analysis as studies have shown that the compounding effects of error propagation in downstream data analysis tasks lead to lower detection accuracy and increased overhead due to unnecessary model updates. Unfortunately, existing work has largely explored anomaly detection and concept drift detection in isolation. We develop AnDri, a system for Anomaly detection in the presence of Drift, which adjusts the normal patterns temporally, and distinguish abnormal subsequences and new concepts. Moreover, it introduces a new clustering method, Adjacent Hierarchical Clustering (AHC), which groups similar subsequences while respecting their temporal locality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version (to be updated)</p></details> |

This method allows for change-points to occur earlier in some series (leading series) followed, after a short delay, by change-points in some other series (lagging series). Such dynamic dependence structure is common in fields such as seismology and neurology where a latent event such as an earthquake or seizure causes certain sensors to register change-points before others. We model these lead-lag dependencies via a latent directed graph and provide a hierarchical prior for learning the graph's structure and parameters. Posterior inference is made tractable by modifying particle MCMC methods designed for univariate change-point problems. We apply our method to both simulated and real datasets from the fields of seismology and neurology. In the simulated data, we find that our method outperforms competing Bayesian methods in settings where the change-point locations are dependent across series. In the real data applications we show that our model can also uncover interpretable network structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local Level Dynamic Random Partition Models for Changepoint Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20085v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by an increasing demand for models that can effectively describe features of complex multivariate time series, e.g. from sensor data in biomechanics, motion analysis, and sports science, we introduce a novel state-space modeling framework where the state equation encodes the evolution of latent partitions of the data over time. Building on the principles of dynamic linear models, our approach develops a random partition model capable of linking data partitions to previous ones over time, using a straightforward Markov structure that accounts for temporal persistence and facilitates changepoint detection. The selection of changepoints involves multiple dependent decisions, and we address this time-dependence by adopting a non-marginal false discovery rate control. This leads to a simple decision rule that ensures more stringent control of the false discovery rate compared to approaches that do not consider dependence. The method is efficiently implemented using a Gibbs sampling algorithm, leading to a straightforward approach compared to existing methods for dependent random partition models. Additionally, we show how the proposed method can be adapted to handle multiview clustering scenarios. Simulation studies and the analysis of a human gesture phase dataset collected through various sensing technologies show the effectiveness of the method in dynamically clustering multivariate time series and detecting changepoints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sensitivity Analysis of Priors in the Bayesian Dirichlet Auto-Regressive Moving Average Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13973v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior choice can strongly influence Bayesian Dirichlet ARMA (B-DARMA) inference for compositional time-series. Using simulations with (i) correct lag order, (ii) overfitting, and (iii) underfitting, we assess five priors: weakly-informative, horseshoe, Laplace, mixture-of-normals, and hierarchical. With the true lag order, all priors achieve comparable RMSE, though horseshoe and hierarchical slightly reduce bias. Under overfitting, aggressive shrinkage-especially the horseshoe-suppresses noise and improves forecasts, yet no prior rescues a model that omits essential VAR or VMA terms. We then fit B-DARMA to daily SP 500 sector weights using an intentionally large lag structure. Shrinkage priors curb spurious dynamics, whereas weakly-informative priors magnify errors in volatile sectors. Two lessons emerge: (1) match shrinkage strength to the degree of overparameterization, and (2) prioritize correct lag selection, because no prior repairs structural misspecification. These insights guide prior selection and model complexity management in high-dimensional compositional time-series applications.</p></details> |  |

Traditional visualizations focus on point-to-point alignment and do not convey the broader structural relationships at the level of subsequences. This limitation makes it difficult to understand how and where one time series shifts, speeds up or slows down with respect to another. To address this, we propose a novel technique that simplifies the warping path to highlight, quantify and visualize key transformations (shift, compression, difference in amplitude). By offering a clearer representation of how subsequences match between time series, our method enhances interpretability in time series comparison.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Relationships of Subjects and Shapelets for Semi-supervised Multivariate Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18043v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) classification is widely applied in fields such as industry, healthcare, and finance, aiming to extract key features from complex time series data for accurate decision-making and prediction. However, existing methods for MTS often struggle due to the challenges of effectively modeling high-dimensional data and the lack of labeled data, resulting in poor classification performance. To address this issue, we propose a heterogeneous relationships of subjects and shapelets method for semi-supervised MTS classification. This method offers a novel perspective by integrating various types of additional information while capturing the relationships between them. Specifically, we first utilize a contrast temporal self-attention module to obtain sparse MTS representations, and then model the similarities between these representations using soft dynamic time warping to construct a similarity graph. Secondly, we learn the shapelets for different subject types, incorporating both the subject features and their shapelets as additional information to further refine the similarity graph, ultimately generating a heterogeneous graph. Finally, we use a dual level graph attention network to get prediction. Through this method, we successfully transform dataset into a heterogeneous graph, integrating multiple additional information and achieving precise semi-supervised node classification. Experiments on the Human Activity Recognition, sleep stage classification and University of East Anglia datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in MTS classification tasks, validating its superiority.</p></details> | <details><summary>We wo...</summary><p>We would like to request the withdrawal of our manuscript due to logical errors in the paper</p></details> |
| **[Contrast Similarity-Aware Dual-Pathway Mamba for Multivariate Time Series Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12222v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) data is generated through multiple sensors across various domains such as engineering application, health monitoring, and the internet of things, characterized by its temporal changes and high dimensional characteristics. Over the past few years, many studies have explored the long-range dependencies and similarities in MTS. However, long-range dependencies are difficult to model due to their temporal changes and high dimensionality makes it difficult to obtain similarities effectively and efficiently. Thus, to address these issues, we propose contrast similarity-aware dual-pathway Mamba for MTS node classification (CS-DPMamba). Firstly, to obtain the dynamic similarity of each sample, we initially use temporal contrast learning module to acquire MTS representations. And then we construct a similarity matrix between MTS representations using Fast Dynamic Time Warping (FastDTW). Secondly, we apply the DPMamba to consider the bidirectional nature of MTS, allowing us to better capture long-range and short-range dependencies within the data. Finally, we utilize the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network enhanced Graph Isomorphism Network to complete the information interaction in the matrix and MTS node classification task. By comprehensively considering the long-range dependencies and dynamic similarity features, we achieved precise MTS node classification. We conducted experiments on multiple University of East Anglia (UEA) MTS datasets, which encompass diverse application scenarios. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our method through both supervised and semi-supervised experiments on the MTS classification task.</p></details> | <details><summary>We wo...</summary><p>We would like to request the withdrawal of our manuscript due to logical errors in the paper</p></details> |

Forecasts help government agencies properly prepare and distribute resources related to opioid overdoses. Our approach uses county and district level aggregations of suspected opioid overdose encounters and forecasts future counts for different time intervals. Models with different levels of complexity were evaluated to minimize forecasting error. A variety of additional covariates relevant to opioid overdoses and public health were tested to determine their impact on model performance. Our evaluation shows that useful predictions can be generated with limited error for different types of regions, and high performance can be achieved using commonly available covariates and relatively simple forecasting models.</p></details> |  |
| **[EnergyDiff: Universal Time-Series Energy Data Generation using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13538v3)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution time series data are crucial for the operation and planning of energy systems such as electrical power systems and heating systems. Such data often cannot be shared due to privacy concerns, necessitating the use of synthetic data. However, high-resolution time series data is difficult to model due to its inherent high dimensionality and complex temporal dependencies. Leveraging the recent development of generative AI, especially diffusion models, we propose EnergyDiff, a universal data generation framework for energy time series data. EnergyDiff builds on state-of-the-art denoising diffusion probabilistic models, utilizing a proposed denoising network dedicated to high-resolution time series data and introducing a novel Marginal Calibration technique. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that EnergyDiff achieves significant improvement in capturing the temporal dependencies and marginal distributions compared to baselines, particularly at the 1-minute resolution. EnergyDiff's universality is validated across diverse energy domains (e.g., electricity demand, heat pump, PV, multiple time resolutions (1 minute, 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 1 hour), and at both customer and transformer levels.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Oscillatory State-Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03943v3)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Linear Oscillatory State-Space models (LinOSS) for efficiently learning on long sequences. Inspired by cortical dynamics of biological neural networks, we base our proposed LinOSS model on a system of forced harmonic oscillators. A stable discretization, integrated over time using fast associative parallel scans, yields the proposed state-space model. We prove that LinOSS produces stable dynamics only requiring nonnegative diagonal state matrix. This is in stark contrast to many previous state-space models relying heavily on restrictive parameterizations. Moreover, we rigorously show that LinOSS is universal, i.e., it can approximate any continuous and causal operator mapping between time-varying functions, to desired accuracy. In addition, we show that an implicit-explicit discretization of LinOSS perfectly conserves the symmetry of time reversibility of the underlying dynamics. Together, these properties enable efficient modeling of long-range interactions, while ensuring stable and accurate long-horizon forecasting. Finally, our empirical results, spanning a wide range of time-series tasks from mid-range to very long-range classification and regression, as well as long-horizon forecasting, demonstrate that our proposed LinOSS model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models. Notably, LinOSS outperforms Mamba and LRU by nearly 2x on a sequence modeling task with sequences of length 50k.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 (Oral) |

While previous works have explored representation learning for this task, the critical challenge of training instability in sequential representations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been overlooked. This work demonstrates that Controlled Differential Equations (CDE) state representation can achieve strong RL policies when two key factors are met: (1) ensuring training stability through early stopping or stabilization methods, and (2) enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation regularization with clinical scores (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS). Experiments on the MIMIC-III sepsis cohort reveal that stable CDE autoencoder produces representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies with superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$). In contrast, unstable CDE representation leads to degraded representations and policy failure (WIS return $\sim$ 0). Visualizations of the latent space show that stable CDEs not only separate survivor and non-survivor trajectories but also reveal clear acuity score gradients, whereas unstable training fails to capture either pattern. These findings highlight practical guidelines for using CDEs to encode irregular medical time series in clinical RL, emphasizing the need for training stability in sequential representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCAI2025 AI4TS</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Battery and Line Undergrounding Investments for Transmission Systems under Wildfire Risk Scenarios: A Benders Decomposition Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06687v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With electric power infrastructure posing an increasing risk of igniting wildfires under continuing climate change, utilities are frequently de-energizing power lines to mitigate wildfire ignition risk, which can cause load shedding. Recent research advocates for installing battery energy storage systems as well as undergrounding risky overhead lines to reduce the load shedding during such de-energizations. Since wildfire ignition risk can exhibit substantial geographic and temporal variations, it is important to plan battery installation and line undergrounding investments while considering multiple possible scenarios. This paper presents a scenario-based framework for optimizing battery installation and line undergrounding investments while considering many scenarios, each consisting of a day-long time series of uncertain parameters for the load demand, renewable generation, and wildfire ignition risks. This problem is difficult to solve due to a large number of scenarios and binary variables associated with the battery placements as well as the lines to be undergrounded. To address the computational challenges, we decompose the problem in a two-stage scheme via a Benders decomposition approach. The first stage is a master problem formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that makes decisions on the locations and sizes of batteries as well as the lines to be undergrounded. The second stage consists of a linear programming model that assesses these battery and line undergrounding decisions as modeled by a DC OPF formulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme on a large-scale transmission network with real world data on wildfire ignition risks, load, and renewable generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Semi-Supervised Approach for Abnormal Event Prediction on Large Operational Network Time-Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07660v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large network logs, recording multivariate time series generated from heterogeneous devices and sensors in a network, can often reveal important information about abnormal activities, such as network intrusions and device malfunctions. Existing machine learning methods for anomaly detection on multivariate time series typically assume that 1) normal sequences would have consistent behavior for training unsupervised models, or 2) require a large set of labeled normal and abnormal sequences for supervised models. However, in practice, normal network activities can demonstrate significantly varying sequence patterns (e.g., before and after rerouting partial network traffic). Also, the recorded abnormal events can be sparse. This paper presents a novel semi-supervised method that efficiently captures dependencies between network time series and across time points to generate meaningful representations of network activities for predicting abnormal events. The method can use the limited labeled data to explicitly learn separable embedding space for normal and abnormal samples and effectively leverage unlabeled data to handle training data scarcity. The experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperformed state-of-the-art approaches for event detection on a large real-world network log.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE BigData2022</p></details> |

This work predicts 48- and 72-week disability using sparse baseline clinical data and 12 weeks of daily digital Floodlight data from the CONSONANCE clinical trial. We employed state-of-the-art tabular and time-series foundation models (FMs), a custom multimodal attention-based transformer, and machine learning methods. Despite the difficulty of early prediction (AUROC 0.63), integrating digital data via advanced models improved performance over clinical data alone. A transformer model using unimodal embeddings from the Moment FM yielded the best result, but our multimodal transformer consistently outperformed its unimodal counterpart, confirming the advantages of combining clinical with digital data. Our findings demonstrate the promise of FMs and multimodal approaches to extract predictive signals from complex and diverse clinical and digital life sciences data (e.g., imaging, omics), enabling more accurate prognostics for MS and potentially other complex diseases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

Continuous data collection through mobile devices generates highly complex data: entangled multivariate time series of outcomes, exposures, and covariates. Missing data is a pervasive problem in biomedical and social science research, and Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data in psychiatric research is no exception. However, the complex data structure of multivariate time series and their non-stationary nature make missing data a major challenge for proper inference. Additional historical information included in time series analyses exacerbates the issue of missing data and also introduces problems for confounding adjustment. The majority of existing imputation methods are either designed for stationary time series or for longitudinal data with limited follow-up periods. The limited work on non-stationary time series either focuses on missing exogenous information or ignores the complex temporal dependence among outcomes, exposures, and covariates. We propose a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization algorithm for the state space model (MCEM-SSM) to effectively handle missing data in non-stationary entangled multivariate time series. We demonstrate the method's advantages over other widely used missing data imputation strategies through simulations of both stationary and non-stationary time series, subject to various missing mechanisms. Finally, we apply the MCEM-SSM to a multi-year smartphone observational study of bipolar and schizophrenia patients to investigate the association between digital social connectivity and negative mood.</p></details> |  |

We study this problem, considering multiple interventions and multiple effects, in the context of time series when only abstractions of the true causal graph in the form of summary causal graphs are available. We focus in this study on identifiability by a common backdoor set, and establish, for time series with and without consistency throughout time, conditions under which such a set exists. We also provide algorithms of limited complexity to decide whether the problem is identifiable or not.</p></details> |  |

A neural network that learns complex dynamics with a small test error may still fail to reproduce its \emph{physical} behavior, including associated statistical moments and Lyapunov exponents. To address this gap, we propose an ergodic theoretic approach to generalization of complex dynamical models learned from time series data. Our main contribution is to define and analyze generalization of a broad suite of neural representations of classes of ergodic systems, including chaotic systems, in a way that captures emulating underlying invariant, physical measures. Our results provide theoretical justification for why regression methods for generators of dynamical systems (Neural ODEs) fail to generalize, and why their statistical accuracy improves upon adding Jacobian information during training. We verify our results on a number of ergodic chaotic systems and neural network parameterizations, including MLPs, ResNets, Fourier Neural layers, and RNNs.</p></details> | in NeuRIPS 2024 |

| **[Leveraging External Factors in Household-Level Electrical Consumption Forecasting using Hypernetworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14472v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate electrical consumption forecasting is crucial for efficient energy management and resource allocation. While traditional time series forecasting relies on historical patterns and temporal dependencies, incorporating external factors -- such as weather indicators -- has shown significant potential for improving prediction accuracy in complex real-world applications. However, the inclusion of these additional features often degrades the performance of global predictive models trained on entire populations, despite improving individual household-level models. To address this challenge, we found that a hypernetwork architecture can effectively leverage external factors to enhance the accuracy of global electrical consumption forecasting models, by specifically adjusting the model weights to each consumer. We collected a comprehensive dataset spanning two years, comprising consumption data from over 6000 luxembourgish households and corresponding external factors such as weather indicators, holidays, and major local events. By comparing various forecasting models, we demonstrate that a hypernetwork approach outperforms existing methods when associated to external factors, reducing forecasting errors and achieving the best accuracy while maintaining the benefits of a global model.</p></details> | ECML PKDD 2025 |
| **[Enhancing Forecasting Accuracy in Dynamic Environments via PELT-Driven Drift Detection and Model Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14133v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate time series forecasting models are often compromised by data drift, where underlying data distributions change over time, leading to significant declines in prediction performance. To address this challenge, this study proposes an adaptive forecasting framework that integrates drift detection with targeted model retraining to compensate for drift effects. The framework utilizes the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm to identify drift points within the feature space of time series data. Once drift intervals are detected, selective retraining is applied to prediction models using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Lasso Regressor architectures, allowing the models to adjust to changing data patterns. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on two datasets: a real-world dataset containing electricity consumption and HVAC system data, and a synthetic financial dataset designed to test cross-domain applicability. Initial baseline models were developed without drift detection using extensive feature engineering. After integrating drift-aware retraining, the MLP model achieved a 44% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) and a 39% increase in R^2 on the real-world dataset, while even greater improvements were observed on the synthetic financial dataset. Similar enhancements were achieved with the Lasso Regressor. These results highlight the robustness and generalizability of incorporating drift detection and adaptive retraining to sustain forecasting accuracy across diverse domains.</p></details> | 18 pages |

Traditional methods, such as passwords and static biometrics, are vulnerable to spoofing and replay attacks, particularly in high-stakes, continuous interactions. This paper presents a novel anti-spoofing and anti-replay authentication approach that leverages distinctive user behavioral features extracted from haptic feedback during human-robot interactions. To evaluate our authentication approach, we collected a time-series force feedback dataset from 15 participants performing seven distinct tasks. We then developed a transformer-based deep learning model to extract temporal features from the haptic signals. By analyzing user-specific force dynamics, our method achieves over 90 percent accuracy in both user identification and task classification, demonstrating its potential for enhancing access control and identity assurance in tele-robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

Despite the advantage of linearity, the operator is generally infinite-dimensional. Therefore, the objective is to learn measurement functions that yield a tractable finite-dimensional Koopman operator approximation. In this work, we establish a connection between Koopman operator approximation and linear Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which have recently demonstrated remarkable success in sequence modeling. We show that by considering an extended state consisting of lagged observations, we can establish an equivalence between a structured Koopman operator and linear RNN updates. Building on this connection, we present SKOLR, which integrates a learnable spectral decomposition of the input signal with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) as the measurement functions and implements a structured Koopman operator via a highly parallel linear RNN stack. Numerical experiments on various forecasting benchmarks and dynamical systems show that this streamlined, Koopman-theory-based design delivers exceptional performance.</p></details> |  |

However, an important yet underexplored challenge is how to effectively finetune TSFMs on specific downstream tasks. While naive finetuning can yield performance gains, we argue that it falls short of fully leveraging TSFMs' capabilities, often resulting in overfitting and suboptimal performance. Given the diverse temporal patterns across sampling scales and the inherent multi-scale forecasting capabilities of TSFMs, we adopt a causal perspective to analyze finetuning process, through which we highlight the critical importance of explicitly modeling multiple scales and reveal the shortcomings of naive approaches. Focusing on \textit{encoder-based} TSFMs, we propose \textbf{M}ulti\textbf{\textsc{s}}cale \textbf{\textsc{f}}ine\textbf{\textsc{t}}uning (\textbf{MSFT}), a simple yet general framework that explicitly integrates multi-scale modeling into the finetuning process. Experimental results on three different backbones (\moirai, \moment\ and \units) demonstrate that TSFMs finetuned with MSFT not only outperform naive and typical parameter efficient finetuning methods but also surpass state-of-the-art deep learning methods.</p></details> |  |

However, many real-world problems exhibit temporal dependence and strong correlations between the marginal distributions of the data-generating process, suggesting that the i.i.d. assumption is often unrealistic. In such cases, models naturally include time-series processes with mixing properties, as well as irreducible and aperiodic ergodic Markov chains. Moreover, the learning rates typically obtained in these settings are independent of the data distribution, which can lead to restrictive choices of hypothesis classes and suboptimal sample complexities for the learning algorithm. In this article, we consider the case where the training dataset is generated by an iterated random function (i.e., an iteratively defined time-homogeneous Markov chain) that is not necessarily irreducible or aperiodic. Under the assumption that the governing function is contractive with respect to its first argument and subject to certain regularity conditions on the hypothesis class, we first establish a uniform convergence result for the corresponding sample error. We then demonstrate the learnability of the approximate empirical risk minimization algorithm and derive its learning rate bound. Both rates are data-distribution dependent, expressed in terms of the Rademacher complexities of the underlying hypothesis class, allowing them to more accurately reflect the properties of the data-generating distribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-Shot Learning for Industrial Time Series: A Comparative Analysis Using the Example of Screw-Fastening Process Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13909v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot learning (FSL) has shown promise in vision but remains largely unexplored for \emph{industrial} time-series data, where annotating every new defect is prohibitively expensive. We present a systematic FSL study on screw-fastening process monitoring, using a 2\,300-sample multivariate torque dataset that covers 16 uni- and multi-factorial defect types. Beyond benchmarking, we introduce a \textbf{label-aware episodic sampler} that collapses multi-label sequences into multiple single-label tasks, keeping the output dimensionality fixed while preserving combinatorial label information. Two FSL paradigms are investigated: the metric-based \emph{Prototypical Network} and the gradient-based \emph{Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning} (MAML), each paired with three backbones: 1D CNN, InceptionTime and the 341 M-parameter transformer \emph{Moment}. On 10-shot, 3-way evaluation, the InceptionTime + Prototypical Network combination achieves a \textbf{0.944 weighted F1} in the multi-class regime and \textbf{0.935} in the multi-label regime, outperforming finetuned Moment by up to 5.3\% while requiring two orders of magnitude fewer parameters and training time. Across all backbones, metric learning consistently surpasses MAML, and our label-aware sampling yields an additional 1.7\% F1 over traditional class-based sampling. These findings challenge the assumption that large foundation models are always superior: when data are scarce, lightweight CNN architectures augmented with simple metric learning not only converge faster but also generalize better. We release code, data splits and pre-trained weights to foster reproducible research and to catalyze the adoption of FSL in high-value manufacturing inspection.</p></details> |  |
| **[OPTIMUS: Observing Persistent Transformations in Multi-temporal Unlabeled Satellite-data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13902v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the face of pressing environmental issues in the 21st century, monitoring surface changes on Earth is more important than ever. Large-scale remote sensing, such as satellite imagery, is an important tool for this task. However, using supervised methods to detect changes is difficult because of the lack of satellite data annotated with change labels, especially for rare categories of change. Annotation proves challenging due to the sparse occurrence of changes in satellite images. Even within a vast collection of images, only a small fraction may exhibit persistent changes of interest. To address this challenge, we introduce OPTIMUS, a self-supervised learning method based on an intuitive principle: if a model can recover information about the relative order of images in the time series, then that implies that there are long-lasting changes in the images. OPTIMUS demonstrates this principle by using change point detection methods on model outputs in a time series. We demonstrate that OPTIMUS can directly detect interesting changes in satellite images, achieving an improvement in AUROC score from 56.3% to 87.6% at distinguishing changed time series from unchanged ones compared to baselines.

In this work, we introduce TimeMaster, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method that enables time-series MLLMs to perform structured, interpretable reasoning directly over visualized time-series inputs and task prompts. TimeMaster adopts a three-part structured output format, reasoning, classification, and domain-specific extension, and is optimized via a composite reward function that aligns format adherence, prediction accuracy, and open-ended insight quality. The model is trained using a two-stage pipeline: we first apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to establish a good initialization, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) at the token level to enable stable and targeted reward-driven improvement in time-series reasoning. We evaluate TimeMaster on the TimerBed benchmark across six real-world classification tasks based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct. TimeMaster achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both classical time-series models and few-shot GPT-4o by over 14.6% and 7.3% performance gain, respectively. Notably, TimeMaster goes beyond time-series classification: it also exhibits expert-like reasoning behavior, generates context-aware explanations, and delivers domain-aligned insights. Our results highlight that reward-driven RL can be a scalable and promising path toward integrating temporal understanding into time-series MLLMs.</p></details> | Preprint |

Accurate wildfire risk prediction is crucial for mitigating these impacts and safeguarding both environmental and human health. This paper provides a comprehensive review of wildfire risk prediction methodologies, with a particular focus on deep learning approaches combined with remote sensing. We begin by defining wildfire risk and summarizing the geographical distribution of related studies. In terms of data, we analyze key predictive features, including fuel characteristics, meteorological and climatic conditions, socioeconomic factors, topography, and hydrology, while also reviewing publicly available wildfire prediction datasets derived from remote sensing. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of feature collinearity assessment and model interpretability to improve the understanding of prediction outcomes. Regarding methodology, we classify deep learning models into three primary categories: time-series forecasting, image segmentation, and spatiotemporal prediction, and further discuss methods for converting model outputs into risk classifications or probability-adjusted predictions. Finally, we identify the key challenges and limitations of current wildfire-risk prediction models and outline several research opportunities. These include integrating diverse remote sensing data, developing multimodal models, designing more computationally efficient architectures, and incorporating cross-disciplinary methods--such as coupling with numerical weather-prediction models--to enhance the accuracy and robustness of wildfire-risk assessments.</p></details> |  |

While traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) remains the cornerstone of operational forecasting, machine learning is emerging as a powerful alternative for fast, flexible, and scalable predictions. We introduce PeakWeather, a high-quality dataset of surface weather observations collected every 10 minutes over more than 8 years from the ground stations of the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology MeteoSwiss's measurement network. The dataset includes a diverse set of meteorological variables from 302 station locations distributed across Switzerland's complex topography and is complemented with topographical indices derived from digital height models for context. Ensemble forecasts from the currently operational high-resolution NWP model are provided as a baseline forecast against which to evaluate new approaches. The dataset's richness supports a broad spectrum of spatiotemporal tasks, including time series forecasting at various scales, graph structure learning, imputation, and virtual sensing. As such, PeakWeather serves as a real-world benchmark to advance both foundational machine learning research, meteorology, and sensor-based applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Explainability in the Era of Multimodal AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13060v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multimodal AI systems (models jointly trained on heterogeneous data types such as text, time series, graphs, and images) have become ubiquitous and achieved remarkable performance across high-stakes applications, transparent and accurate explanation algorithms are crucial for their safe deployment and ensure user trust. However, most existing explainability techniques remain unimodal, generating modality-specific feature attributions, concepts, or circuit traces in isolation and thus failing to capture cross-modal interactions. This paper argues that such unimodal explanations systematically misrepresent and fail to capture the cross-modal influence that drives multimodal model decisions, and the community should stop relying on them for interpreting multimodal models. To support our position, we outline key principles for multimodal explanations grounded in modality: Granger-style modality influence (controlled ablations to quantify how removing one modality changes the explanation for another), Synergistic faithfulness (explanations capture the model's predictive power when modalities are combined), and Unified stability (explanations remain consistent under small, cross-modal perturbations). This targeted shift to multimodal explanations will help the community uncover hidden shortcuts, mitigate modality bias, improve model reliability, and enhance safety in high-stakes settings where incomplete explanations can have serious consequences.</p></details> |  |

We examine the Forecast-Then-Optimize (FTO) framework, pioneering its systematic synopsis. Unlike conventional Predict-Then-Optimize (PTO) methods, FTO explicitly refines forecasts through optimization techniques such as ensemble methods, meta-learners, and uncertainty adjustments. Furthermore, deep learning and large language models have established superiority over traditional parametric forecasting models for most enterprise applications. This paper surveys significant advancements from 2016 to 2025, analyzing mainstream deep learning FTO architectures. Focusing on real-world applications in operations management, we demonstrate FTO's crucial role in enhancing predictive accuracy, robustness, and decision efficacy. Our study establishes foundational guidelines for future forecasting methodologies, bridging theory and operational practicality.</p></details> | 44 pages, 2 figures |

As a result, the demand for high-precision orbital data on space objects-along with comprehensive analyses of satellite positioning, constellation configurations, and deep space satellite dynamics-has grown more urgent. However, there remains a notable lack of publicly accessible, real-world datasets to support research in areas such as space object maneuver behavior prediction and collision risk assessment. This study seeks to address this gap by collecting and curating a representative dataset of maneuvering behavior from Starlink satellites. The dataset integrates Two-Line Element (TLE) catalog data with corresponding high-precision ephemeris data, thereby enabling a more realistic and multidimensional modeling of space object behavior. It provides valuable insights into practical deployment of maneuver detection methods and the evaluation of collision risks in increasingly congested orbital environments.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explore simple and flexible prompt-based strategies that enable LLMs to perform time series forecasting without extensive retraining or the use of a complex external architecture. Through the exploration of specialized prompting methods that leverage time series decomposition, patch-based tokenization, and similarity-based neighbor augmentation, we find that it is possible to enhance LLM forecasting quality while maintaining simplicity and requiring minimal preprocessing of data. To this end, we propose our own method, PatchInstruct, which enables LLMs to make precise and effective predictions.</p></details> |  |

| **[ReasonFlux-PRM: Trajectory-Aware PRMs for Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18896v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for supervising intermediate reasoning steps in large language models (LLMs). Previous PRMs are primarily trained on model final output responses and struggle to evaluate intermediate thinking trajectories robustly, especially in the emerging setting of trajectory-response outputs generated by frontier reasoning models like Deepseek-R1. In this work, we introduce ReasonFlux-PRM, a novel trajectory-aware PRM explicitly designed to evaluate the trajectory-response type of reasoning traces. ReasonFlux-PRM incorporates both step-level and trajectory-level supervision, enabling fine-grained reward assignment aligned with structured chain-of-thought data. We adapt ReasonFlux-PRM to support reward supervision under both offline and online settings, including (i) selecting high-quality model distillation data for downstream supervised fine-tuning of smaller models, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for policy optimization during reinforcement learning, and (iii) enabling reward-guided Best-of-N test-time scaling. Empirical results on challenging downstream benchmarks such as AIME, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that ReasonFlux-PRM-7B selects higher quality data than strong PRMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B) and human-curated baselines. Furthermore, our derived ReasonFlux-PRM-7B yields consistent performance improvements, achieving average gains of 12.1% in supervised fine-tuning, 4.5% in reinforcement learning, and 6.3% in test-time scaling. We also release our efficient ReasonFlux-PRM-1.5B for resource-constrained applications and edge deployment.

These agents operate by autonomously generating natural language thoughts, invoking external tools, and iteratively refining their solutions. Despite their widespread adoption, the internal decision-making processes of these agents remain largely unexplored, limiting our understanding of their operational dynamics and failure modes. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of the thought-action-result trajectories of three state-of-the-art LLM-based agents: \textsc{RepairAgent}, \textsc{AutoCodeRover}, and \textsc{OpenHands}. We unify their interaction logs into a common format, capturing 120 trajectories and 2822 LLM interactions focused on program repair and issue resolution. Our study combines quantitative analyses of structural properties, action patterns, and token usage with qualitative assessments of reasoning coherence and feedback integration. We identify key trajectory characteristics such as iteration counts and token consumption, recurring action sequences, and the semantic coherence linking thoughts, actions, and their results. Our findings reveal behavioral motifs and anti-patterns that distinguish successful from failed executions, providing actionable insights for improving agent design, including prompting strategies, failure diagnosis, and anti-pattern detection. We release our dataset and annotation framework to support further research on transparent and robust autonomous software engineering agents.</p></details> |  |

To achieve effective neighboring people selection, we propose a people selection module called the Importance Estimator which outputs the importance of each neighboring person for predicting the primary person's future trajectory. To prevent gradients from being blocked by non-differentiable operations when sampling surrounding people based on their importance, we employ the Gumbel Softmax for training. Experiments conducted on the JRDB dataset show that our method speeds up the process with competitive prediction accuracy.</p></details> | MIRU 2025 |

While statistically grounded criteria are primarily relied upon, clinical relevance is gradually emphasized in medicine to ensure that the identified trajectory heterogeneity appropriately reflects changes in a disease or symptom over time. However, such considerations are often judged through visual comparisons, without concrete approaches for their application. To address this, the Area Between Trajectories (ABTs) was introduced as insights for quantifying trajectory group differences. Using a simulated sleep quality dataset, GBTM was applied to build and compare models. Subsequently, ABTs was demonstrated to show how it works, while also highlighting its limitations and potential applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[DriveSuprim: Towards Precise Trajectory Selection for End-to-End Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06659v2)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In complex driving environments, autonomous vehicles must navigate safely. Relying on a single predicted path, as in regression-based approaches, usually does not explicitly assess the safety of the predicted trajectory. Selection-based methods address this by generating and scoring multiple trajectory candidates and predicting the safety score for each, but face optimization challenges in precisely selecting the best option from thousands of possibilities and distinguishing subtle but safety-critical differences, especially in rare or underrepresented scenarios. We propose DriveSuprim to overcome these challenges and advance the selection-based paradigm through a coarse-to-fine paradigm for progressive candidate filtering, a rotation-based augmentation method to improve robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, and a self-distillation framework to stabilize training. DriveSuprim achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 93.5% PDMS in NAVSIM v1 and 87.1% EPDMS in NAVSIM v2 without extra data, demonstrating superior safetycritical capabilities, including collision avoidance and compliance with rules, while maintaining high trajectory quality in various driving scenarios.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Leveling the Playing Field: Carefully Comparing Classical and Learned Controllers for Quadrotor Trajectory Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17832v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based control approaches like reinforcement learning (RL) have recently produced a slew of impressive results for tasks like quadrotor trajectory tracking and drone racing. Naturally, it is common to demonstrate the advantages of these new controllers against established methods like analytical controllers. We observe, however, that reliably comparing the performance of such very different classes of controllers is more complicated than might appear at first sight. As a case study, we take up the problem of agile tracking of an end-effector for a quadrotor with a fixed arm. We develop a set of best practices for synthesizing the best-in-class RL and geometric controllers (GC) for benchmarking. In the process, we resolve widespread RL-favoring biases in prior studies that provide asymmetric access to: (1) the task definition, in the form of an objective function, (2) representative datasets, for parameter optimization, and (3) feedforward information, describing the desired future trajectory. The resulting findings are the following: our improvements to the experimental protocol for comparing learned and classical controllers are critical, and each of the above asymmetries can yield misleading conclusions. Prior works have claimed that RL outperforms GC, but we find the gaps between the two controller classes are much smaller than previously published when accounting for symmetric comparisons. Geometric control achieves lower steady-state error than RL, while RL has better transient performance, resulting in GC performing better in relatively slow or less agile tasks, but RL performing better when greater agility is required. Finally, we open-source implementations of geometric and RL controllers for these aerial vehicles, implementing best practices for future development.

| **[Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving: Progress, Limitations, and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03262v2)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the potential for autonomous vehicles to be integrated on a large scale into modern traffic systems continues to grow, ensuring safe navigation in dynamic environments is crucial for smooth integration. To guarantee safety and prevent collisions, autonomous vehicles must be capable of accurately predicting the trajectories of surrounding traffic agents. Over the past decade, significant efforts from both academia and industry have been dedicated to designing solutions for precise trajectory forecasting. These efforts have produced a diverse range of approaches, raising questions about the differences between these methods and whether trajectory prediction challenges have been fully addressed. This paper reviews a substantial portion of recent trajectory prediction methods proposing a taxonomy to classify existing solutions. A general overview of the prediction pipeline is also provided, covering input and output modalities, modeling features, and prediction paradigms existing in the literature. In addition, the paper discusses active research areas within trajectory prediction, addresses the posed research questions, and highlights the remaining research gaps and challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-informed mixture of experts network for interpretable battery degradation trajectory computation amid second-life complexities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17755v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retired electric vehicle batteries offer immense potential to support low-carbon energy systems, but uncertainties in their degradation behavior and data inaccessibilities under second-life use pose major barriers to safe and scalable deployment. This work proposes a Physics-Informed Mixture of Experts (PIMOE) network that computes battery degradation trajectories using partial, field-accessible signals in a single cycle. PIMOE leverages an adaptive multi-degradation prediction module to classify degradation modes using expert weight synthesis underpinned by capacity-voltage and relaxation data, producing latent degradation trend embeddings. These are input to a use-dependent recurrent network for long-term trajectory prediction. Validated on 207 batteries across 77 use conditions and 67,902 cycles, PIMOE achieves an average mean absolute percentage (MAPE) errors of 0.88% with a 0.43 ms inference time. Compared to the state-of-the-art Informer and PatchTST, it reduces computational time and MAPE by 50%, respectively. Compatible with random state of charge region sampling, PIMOE supports 150-cycle forecasts with 1.50% average and 6.26% maximum MAPE, and operates effectively even with pruned 5MB training data. Broadly, PIMOE framework offers a deployable, history-free solution for battery degradation trajectory computation, redefining how second-life energy storage systems are assessed, optimized, and integrated into the sustainable energy landscape.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory tracking control of USV with actuator constraints in the presence of disturbances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17005v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>All practical systems often pose a problem of finite control capability, which can notably degrade the performance if not properly addressed. Since actuator input bounds are typically known, integrating actuator saturation considerations into the control law design process can lead to enhanced performance and more precise trajectory tracking. Also, the actuators cannot provide the demanded forces or torques instantaneously; hence, there is a limitation on the rate of magnitude. This work proposes nonlinear feedback controller designs developed using the Lyapunov stability and backstepping method while actively considering the actuator magnitude and rate constraints. The system dynamics are augmented with a smooth control input saturation model. Additionally, an observer is incorporated to estimate the disturbance vector. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, we demonstrate the system's stability under the proposed controller for the Uncrewed Surface Vessel (USV), ensuring adherence to actuator constraints provided their initial values fall within the prescribed bounds. Extensive numerical simulations performed by considering various trajectories and multiple initial conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller in maintaining tracking performance without violating actuator constraints. This work also relaxes the assumption of equally capable actuators to be used to control the motion of USVs, affirming the viability of the controller in practical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional methods often struggle to extract deep semantic representations and incorporate contextual map information. We propose TrajSceneLLM, a multimodal perspective for enhancing semantic understanding of GPS trajectories. The framework integrates visualized map images (encoding spatial context) and textual descriptions generated through LLM reasoning (capturing temporal sequences and movement dynamics). Separate embeddings are generated for each modality and then concatenated to produce trajectory scene embeddings with rich semantic content which are further paired with a simple MLP classifier. We validate the proposed framework on Travel Mode Identification (TMI), a critical task for analyzing travel choices and understanding mobility behavior. Our experiments show that these embeddings achieve significant performance improvement, highlighting the advantage of our LLM-driven method in capturing deep spatio-temporal dependencies and reducing reliance on handcrafted features. This semantic enhancement promises significant potential for diverse downstream applications and future research in geospatial artificial intelligence.

While model-driven, rule-based, and classical learning-based methods are widely used to tackle these tasks at present, they can struggle to effectively capture the complex, multimodal distributions of future trajectories. In this paper we investigate whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on videos of bird's-eye view (BEV) traffic scenarios can generate statistically accurate trajectories that correctly capture spatial relationships between the agents. To this end, we propose a pipeline that uses low-resolution BEV occupancy grid videos as training data for a video generative model. From the generated videos of traffic scenarios we extract abstract trajectory data using single-frame object detection and frame-to-frame object matching. We particularly choose a GAN architecture for the fast training and inference times with respect to diffusion models. We obtain our best results within 100 GPU hours of training, with inference times under 20\,ms. We demonstrate the physical realism of the proposed trajectories in terms of distribution alignment of spatial and dynamic parameters with respect to the ground truth videos from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Trust Region Sequential Convex Optimization for Multi-Drone Thermal Screening Trajectory Planning in Urban Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06012v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid detection of abnormal body temperatures in urban populations is essential for managing public health risks, especially during outbreaks of infectious diseases. Multi-drone thermal screening systems offer promising solutions for fast, large-scale, and non-intrusive human temperature monitoring. However, trajectory planning for multiple drones in complex urban environments poses significant challenges, including collision avoidance, coverage efficiency, and constrained flight environments. In this study, we propose an enhanced trust region sequential convex optimization (TR-SCO) algorithm for optimal trajectory planning of multiple drones performing thermal screening tasks. Our improved algorithm integrates a refined convex optimization formulation within a trust region framework, effectively balancing trajectory smoothness, obstacle avoidance, altitude constraints, and maximum screening coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves trajectory optimality and computational efficiency compared to conventional convex optimization methods. This research provides critical insights and practical contributions toward deploying efficient multi-drone systems for real-time thermal screening in urban areas.

| **[Autonomous Trajectory Optimization for UAVs in Disaster Zone Using Henry Gas Optimization Scheme](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15910v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a disaster-prone environment plays important role in assisting the rescue services and providing the internet connectivity with the outside world. However, in such a complex environment the selection of optimum trajectory of UAVs is of utmost importance. UAV trajectory optimization deals with finding the shortest path in the minimal possible time. In this paper, a cluster optimization scheme (COS) is proposed using the Henry gas optimization (HGO) metaheuristic algorithm to identify the shortest path having minimal transportation cost and algorithm complexity. The mathematical model is designed for COS using the HGO algorithm and compared with the state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey wolf optimization (GWO), cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) and barnacles mating optimizer (BMO). In order to prove the robustness of the proposed model, four different scenarios are evaluated that includes ambient environment, constrict environment, tangled environment, and complex environment. In all the aforementioned scenarios, the HGO algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms. Particularly, in the ambient environment, the HGO algorithm achieves a 39.3% reduction in transportation cost and a 16.8% reduction in computational time as compared to the PSO algorithm. Hence, the HGO algorithm can be used for autonomous trajectory optimization of UAVs in smart cities.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figuers |
| **[TrajDiff: Diffusion Bridge Network with Semantic Alignment for Trajectory Similarity Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15898v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the proliferation of location-tracking technologies, massive volumes of trajectory data are continuously being collected. As a fundamental task in trajectory data mining, trajectory similarity computation plays a critical role in a wide range of real-world applications. However, existing learning-based methods face three challenges: First, they ignore the semantic gap between GPS and grid features in trajectories, making it difficult to obtain meaningful trajectory embeddings. Second, the noise inherent in the trajectories, as well as the noise introduced during grid discretization, obscures the true motion patterns of the trajectories. Third, existing methods focus solely on point-wise and pair-wise losses, without utilizing the global ranking information obtained by sorting all trajectories according to their similarity to a given trajectory. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel trajectory similarity computation framework, named TrajDiff. Specifically, the semantic alignment module relies on cross-attention and an attention score mask mechanism with adaptive fusion, effectively eliminating semantic discrepancies between data at two scales and generating a unified representation. Additionally, the DDBM-based Noise-robust Pre-Training introduces the transfer patterns between any two trajectories into the model training process, enhancing the model's noise robustness. Finally, the overall ranking-aware regularization shifts the model's focus from a local to a global perspective, enabling it to capture the holistic ordering information among trajectories. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets show that TrajDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. In particular, it achieves an average HR@1 gain of 33.38% across all three evaluation metrics and datasets.</p></details> |  |

MENSA learns a shared representation of the input features while capturing the complex dependence structures between events. In practice, it optimizes the sum of the traditional negative log-likelihood across events and a novel trajectory-based likelihood, which encourages the model to learn the temporal order in which events occur. Experiments on real-world clinical datasets demonstrate that MENSA improves risk and time-to-event prediction compared to state-of-the-art models across single-event, competing-risk, and multi-event settings. Moreover, MENSA achieves this with fewer parameters and lower computational cost (FLOPs) than several deep learning baselines, particularly in high-dimensional feature spaces (more than 100 features).</p></details> |  |

However, their performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories. Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally, RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on the Tanks\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.</p></details> | IROS 2025 |

This metric builds on the recently introduced probabilistic GOSPA metric to account for both the existence and state estimation uncertainties of individual object states. Similar to trajectory GOSPA (TGOSPA), it can be formulated as a multidimensional assignment problem, and its linear programming relaxation--also a valid metric--is computable in polynomial time. Additionally, this metric retains the interpretability of TGOSPA, and we show that its decomposition yields intuitive costs terms associated to expected localization error and existence probability mismatch error for properly detected objects, expected missed and false detection error, and track switch error. The effectiveness of the proposed metric is demonstrated through a simulation study.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

However, due to the instability of heterogeneous communication and time-varying characteristics of SAGIN, it is challenging to meet the remote Internet of Things (IoT) demands for data collection and offloading. In this paper, we investigate a two-phase hierarchical data uplink model in SAGIN. Specifically, UAVs optimize trajectories to enable efficient data collection from IoT devices, and then they transmit the data to LEO satellites with computing capabilities for further processing. The problem is formulated to minimize the total energy consumption for IoT devices, UAVs, and LEO satellites. Since the problem is in the form of mixed-integer nonlinear programming and intractable to solve directly, we decompose it into two phases. In the IoT-UAV phase, we design the algorithm to jointly optimize the IoT pairing, power allocation, and UAVs trajectories. Considering the high dynamic characteristics of LEO satellites, a real-time LEO satellite selection mechanism joint with the Satellite Tool Kit is proposed in the UAV-LEO phase. Finally, simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, with about 10% less energy consumption compared with the benchmark algorithm.</p></details> |  |

Purpose: Our objective is to develop a general, nonlinear gradient system model that can accurately predict gradient distortions using convolutional networks. Methods: A set of training gradient waveforms were measured on a small animal imaging system, and used to train a temporal convolutional network to predict the gradient waveforms produced by the imaging system. Results: The trained network was able to accurately predict nonlinear distortions produced by the gradient system. Network prediction of gradient waveforms was incorporated into the image reconstruction pipeline and provided improvements in image quality and diffusion parameter mapping compared to both the nominal gradient waveform and the gradient impulse response function. Conclusion: Temporal convolutional networks can more accurately model gradient system behavior than existing linear methods and may be used to retrospectively correct gradient errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlowAlign: Trajectory-Regularized, Inversion-Free Flow-based Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23145v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent inversion-free, flow-based image editing methods such as FlowEdit leverages a pre-trained noise-to-image flow model such as Stable Diffusion 3, enabling text-driven manipulation by solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE). While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source consistency. To address this limitation, we propose FlowAlign, a novel inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with principled trajectory control. FlowAlign introduces a flow-matching loss as a regularization mechanism to promote smoother and more stable trajectories during the editing process. Notably, the flow-matching loss is shown to explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory, highlighting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation.

While existing approaches primarily focus on social interactions between pedestrians, they often overlook the rich environmental context that significantly shapes human movement patterns. In this paper, we propose SceneAware, a novel framework that explicitly incorporates scene understanding to enhance trajectory prediction accuracy. Our method leverages a Vision Transformer~(ViT) scene encoder to process environmental context from static scene images, while Multi-modal Large Language Models~(MLLMs) generate binary walkability masks that distinguish between accessible and restricted areas during training. We combine a Transformer-based trajectory encoder with the ViT-based scene encoder, capturing both temporal dynamics and spatial constraints. The framework integrates collision penalty mechanisms that discourage predicted trajectories from violating physical boundaries, ensuring physically plausible predictions. SceneAware is implemented in both deterministic and stochastic variants. Comprehensive experiments on the ETH/UCY benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with more than 50\% improvement over previous models. Our analysis based on different trajectory categories shows that the model performs consistently well across various types of pedestrian movement. This highlights the importance of using explicit scene information and shows that our scene-aware approach is both effective and reliable in generating accurate and physically plausible predictions.

However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer flexibility to define precise motion but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) handles high-dimensional spaces with strong robustness but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. Opt2Skill generates dynamic feasible and contact-consistent reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and trains RL policies to track these optimal trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms baselines that rely on human demonstrations and inverse kinematics-based references, both in motion tracking and task success rates. Furthermore, we show that incorporating trajectories with torque information improves contact force tracking in contact-involved tasks, such as wiping a table. We have successfully transferred our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate learning-based models that imitate a model-based time-optimal trajectory planner to accelerate trajectory generation. Given a dataset of collision-free geometric paths, we show that modeling architectures can effectively learn the patterns underlying time-optimal trajectories. We introduce a quantitative framework to analyze local analytic properties of the learned models, and link them to the Backward Reachable Tube of the geometric tracking controller. To enhance robustness, we propose a data augmentation scheme that applies random perturbations to the input paths. Compared to classical planners, our method achieves substantial speedups, and we validate its real-time feasibility on a hardware quadrotor platform. Experiments demonstrate that the learned models generalize to previously unseen path lengths. The code for our approach can be found here: https://github.com/maokat12/lbTOPPQuad</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel mixed Bernstein-Fourier approximation framework tailored explicitly for optimal motion planning. Our proposed methodology leverages the uniform convergence properties of Bernstein polynomials for nonperiodic behaviors while effectively capturing periodic dynamics through Fourier series. Theoretical results are established, including uniform convergence proofs for approximations of functions, derivatives, and integrals, as well as detailed error bound analyses. We further introduce a regulated least squares approach for determining approximation coefficients, enhancing numerical stability and practical applicability. Within an optimal control context, we establish feasibility and consistency of approximated solutions to their continuous counterparts. We also extend the covector mapping theorem, providing theoretical guarantees for approximating dual variables crucial in verifying the necessary optimality conditions from Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Comprehensive numerical examples illustrate the method's superior performance, demonstrating substantial improvements in computational efficiency and precision in scenarios with complex periodic constraints and dynamics. Our mixed Bernstein-Fourier methodology thus presents a robust, theoretically grounded, and computationally efficient approach for advanced optimal trajectory planning in autonomous systems.</p></details> | 49 pages, 9 figures |

This task is challenging due to its ill-posed nature and the limited multi-view video data for training. Traditional reconstruction methods struggle with extreme trajectory changes, and existing generative models for dynamic novel view synthesis cannot handle in-the-wild videos. Our approach consists of two steps: estimating temporally consistent geometry, and generative rendering guided by this geometry. By integrating geometric priors, the generative model focuses on synthesizing realistic details where the estimated geometry is uncertain. We eliminate the need for extensive 4D training data through a factorized fine-tuning framework that separately trains spatial and temporal components using multi-view image and video data. Our method outperforms baselines in producing plausible videos from novel camera trajectories, especially in extreme extrapolation scenarios on real-world footage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project page can be found at https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/Vid-CamEdit/</p></details> |

The tracking problem is motivated by a hierarchical control concept where a higher-level instance provides the reference trajectory at run-time. We present a computational efficient implementation of the feedback linearisation MFC design, and apply high-gain feedback in the process control loop (PCL) to achieve practical tracking in presence of Lipschitz perturbations. Our main results establish ultimate boundedness of the tracking error and give a constructive bound for the high-gain scaling parameter to achieve arbitrary tracking precision. Further we establish that the peaking phenomenon can be attenuated using MFC. We demonstrate the results via an automotive case study considering advanced engine-based cruise control.</p></details> |  |

However, existing calibration methods typically require complex and often human-operated processes to collect data. Moreover, most frameworks neglect acoustic sensors, thereby limiting the associated systems' auditory perception capabilities. To alleviate these issues, we propose an observability-aware active calibration method for ground robots with multimodal sensors, including a microphone array, a LiDAR (exteroceptive sensors), and wheel encoders (proprioceptive sensors). Unlike traditional approaches, our method enables active trajectory optimization for online data collection and calibration, contributing to the development of more intelligent robotic systems. Specifically, we leverage the Fisher information matrix (FIM) to quantify parameter observability and adopt its minimum eigenvalue as an optimization metric for trajectory generation via B-spline curves. Through planning and replanning of robot trajectory online, the method enhances the observability of multi-sensor extrinsic parameters. The effectiveness and advantages of our method have been demonstrated through numerical simulations and real-world experiments. For the benefit of the community, we have also open-sourced our code and data at https://github.com/AISLAB-sustech/Multisensor-Calibration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and to appear in the IEEE Sensors Journal</p></details> |

However, it is unclear to what extent such effects lead to meaningfully different networks, either in terms of the models' weights or the underlying functions that were learned. In this work, we show that during the initial "chaotic" phase of training, even extremely small perturbations reliably causes otherwise identical training trajectories to diverge-an effect that diminishes rapidly over training time. We quantify this divergence through (i) $L^2$ distance between parameters, (ii) the loss barrier when interpolating between networks, (iii) $L^2$ and barrier between parameters after permutation alignment, and (iv) representational similarity between intermediate activations; revealing how perturbations across different hyperparameter or fine-tuning settings drive training trajectories toward distinct loss minima. Our findings provide insights into neural network training stability, with practical implications for fine-tuning, model merging, and diversity of model ensembles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ICML 2025.

| **[Intra-Trajectory Consistency for Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09096v3)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward models are critical for improving large language models (LLMs), particularly in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or inference-time verification. Current reward modeling typically relies on scores of overall responses to learn the outcome rewards for the responses. However, since the response-level scores are coarse-grained supervision signals, the reward model struggles to identify the specific components within a response trajectory that truly correlate with the scores, leading to poor generalization on unseen responses. In this paper, we propose to leverage generation probabilities to establish reward consistency between processes in the response trajectory, which allows the response-level supervisory signal to propagate across processes, thereby providing additional fine-grained signals for reward learning. Building on analysis under the Bayesian framework, we develop an intra-trajectory consistency regularization to enforce that adjacent processes with higher next-token generation probability maintain more consistent rewards. We apply the proposed regularization to the advanced outcome reward model, improving its performance on RewardBench. Besides, we show that the reward model trained with the proposed regularization induces better DPO-aligned policies and achieves better best-of-N (BON) inference-time verification results.

However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Using iterated local alignment to aggregate trajectory data into a traffic flow map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17500v5)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle trajectories are a promising GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) data source to compute multi-scale traffic flow maps ranging from the city/regional level to the road level. The main obstacle is that trajectory data are prone to measurement noise. While this is negligible for city level, large-scale flow aggregation, it poses substantial difficulties for road level, small-scale aggregation. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. We deploy these algorithms in an iterative workflow to compute locally aligned flow maps. By applying this workflow to synthetic and empirical trajectories, we verify that our locally aligned flow maps provide high levels of accuracy and spatial resolution of flow aggregation at multiple scales for static and interactive maps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constraint-Guided Prediction Refinement via Deterministic Diffusion Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12911v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world machine learning tasks require outputs that satisfy hard constraints, such as physical conservation laws, structured dependencies in graphs, or column-level relationships in tabular data. Existing approaches rely either on domain-specific architectures and losses or on strong assumptions on the constraint space, restricting their applicability to linear or convex constraints. We propose a general-purpose framework for constraint-aware refinement that leverages denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs). Starting from a coarse prediction, our method iteratively refines it through a deterministic diffusion trajectory guided by a learned prior and augmented by constraint gradient corrections. The approach accommodates a wide class of non-convex and nonlinear equality constraints and can be applied post hoc to any base model. We demonstrate the method in two representative domains: constrained adversarial attack generation on tabular data with column-level dependencies and in AC power flow prediction under Kirchhoff's laws. Across both settings, our diffusion-guided refinement improves both constraint satisfaction and performance while remaining lightweight and model-agnostic.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrojanTO: Action-Level Backdoor Attacks against Trajectory Optimization Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12815v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Trajectory Optimization (TO) models have achieved remarkable success in offline reinforcement learning. However, their vulnerabilities against backdoor attacks are poorly understood. We find that existing backdoor attacks in reinforcement learning are based on reward manipulation, which are largely ineffective against the TO model due to its inherent sequence modeling nature. Moreover, the complexities introduced by high-dimensional action spaces further compound the challenge of action manipulation. To address these gaps, we propose TrojanTO, the first action-level backdoor attack against TO models. TrojanTO employs alternating training to enhance the connection between triggers and target actions for attack effectiveness. To improve attack stealth, it utilizes precise poisoning via trajectory filtering for normal performance and batch poisoning for trigger consistency. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TrojanTO effectively implants backdoor attacks across diverse tasks and attack objectives with a low attack budget (0.3\% of trajectories). Furthermore, TrojanTO exhibits broad applicability to DT, GDT, and DC, underscoring its scalability across diverse TO model architectures.</p></details> | 23 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Towards Physics-informed Diffusion for Anomaly Detection in Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06999v2)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given trajectory data, a domain-specific study area, and a user-defined threshold, we aim to find anomalous trajectories indicative of possible GPS spoofing (e.g., fake trajectory). The problem is societally important to curb illegal activities in international waters, such as unauthorized fishing and illicit oil transfers. The problem is challenging due to advances in AI generated in deep fakes generation (e.g., additive noise, fake trajectories) and lack of adequate amount of labeled samples for ground-truth verification. Recent literature shows promising results for anomalous trajectory detection using generative models despite data sparsity. However, they do not consider fine-scale spatiotemporal dependencies and prior physical knowledge, resulting in higher false-positive rates. To address these limitations, we propose a physics-informed diffusion model that integrates kinematic constraints to identify trajectories that do not adhere to physical laws. Experimental results on real-world datasets in the maritime and urban domains show that the proposed framework results in higher prediction accuracy and lower estimation error rate for anomaly detection and trajectory generation methods, respectively. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/arunshar/Physics-Informed-Diffusion-Probabilistic-Model.</p></details> |  |

We leverage the connections between trajectory inference and continuous-time synthetic data generation, along with a computational method based on mean-field Langevin dynamics. As discretized mean-field Langevin dynamics and noisy particle gradient descent are equivalent, DP results for noisy SGD can be applied to our setting. We provide experiments that generate realistic trajectories on a synthesized variation of hand-drawn MNIST data while maintaining meaningful privacy guarantees. Crucially, our method has strong utility guarantees under the setting where each person contributes data for \emph{only one time point}, while prior methods require each person to contribute their \emph{entire temporal trajectory}--directly improving the privacy characteristics by construction.</p></details> |  |

However, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels, which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios, demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where uncertainty is inherently higher.

In unsupervised healthcare data analysis, interpreting clustered data can offer meaningful insights into patients' health outcomes, which hold direct implications for healthcare providers. This paper addresses the problem of interpreting clustered sensor data collected from older adult patients recovering from lower-limb fractures in the community. A total of 560 days of multimodal sensor data, including acceleration, step count, ambient motion, GPS location, heart rate, and sleep, alongside clinical scores, were remotely collected from patients at home. Clustering was first carried out separately for each data modality to assess the impact of feature sets extracted from each modality on patients' recovery trajectories. Then, using context-aware prompting, a large language model was employed to infer meaningful cluster labels for the clusters derived from each modality. The quality of these clusters and their corresponding labels was validated through rigorous statistical testing and visualization against clinical scores collected alongside the multimodal sensor data. The results demonstrated the statistical significance of most modality-specific cluster labels generated by the large language model with respect to clinical scores, confirming the efficacy of the proposed method for interpreting sensor data in an unsupervised manner. This unsupervised data analysis approach, relying solely on sensor data, enables clinicians to identify at-risk patients and take timely measures to improve health outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end. DiffTORI addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTORI is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTORI for imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with high-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feed-forward policy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion. Across 15 model-based RL tasks and 35 imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional image and point cloud inputs, DiffTORI outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both domains.

In this paper, we establish a generalization bound for gradient flow that aligns with the classical Rademacher complexity bounds for kernel methods-specifically those based on the RKHS norm and kernel trace-through a data-dependent kernel called the loss path kernel (LPK). Unlike static kernels such as NTK, the LPK captures the entire training trajectory, adapting to both data and optimization dynamics, leading to tighter and more informative generalization guarantees. Moreover, the bound highlights how the norm of the training loss gradients along the optimization trajectory influences the final generalization performance. The key technical ingredients in our proof combine stability analysis of gradient flow with uniform convergence via Rademacher complexity. Our bound recovers existing kernel regression bounds for overparameterized neural networks and shows the feature learning capability of neural networks compared to kernel methods. Numerical experiments on real-world datasets validate that our bounds correlate well with the true generalization gap.</p></details> |  |

Poutine is trained in two stages. To obtain strong base driving capabilities, we train Poutine-Base in a self-supervised vision-language-trajectory (VLT) next-token prediction fashion on 83 hours of CoVLA nominal driving and 11 hours of Waymo long-tail driving. Accompanying language annotations are auto-generated with a 72B-parameter VLM. Poutine is obtained by fine-tuning Poutine-Base with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using less than 500 preference-labeled frames from the Waymo validation set. We show that both VLT pretraining and RL fine-tuning are critical to attain strong driving performance in the long-tail. Poutine-Base achieves a rater-feedback score (RFS) of 8.12 on the validation set, nearly matching Waymo's expert ground-truth RFS. The final Poutine model achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the official Waymo test set, placing 1st in the 2025 Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge by a significant margin. These results highlight the promise of scalable VLT pre-training and lightweight RL fine-tuning to enable robust and generalizable autonomy.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, we propose a \textit{lifting back} operator to obtain trajectories generated by embedding the initial state and iterating a linear system in a higher dimension. This naturally yields an $O(N^{-1/2})$ error bound for mean trajectories.

While high-fidelity nonlinear time history analysis provides the most comprehensive and accurate representation of the responses, it becomes computationally prohibitive for complex structural system models and repeated simulations under varying ground motions. To address this challenge, we propose a composite learning framework that integrates simplified physics-based models with a Fourier neural operator to enable efficient and accurate trajectory-level seismic response prediction. In the proposed architecture, a simplified physics-based model, obtained from techniques such as linearization, modal reduction, or solver relaxation, serves as a preprocessing operator to generate structural response trajectories that capture coarse dynamic characteristics. A neural operator is then trained to correct the discrepancy between these initial approximations and the true nonlinear responses, allowing the composite model to capture hysteretic and path-dependent behaviors. Additionally, a linear regression-based postprocessing scheme is introduced to further refine predictions and quantify associated uncertainty with negligible additional computational effort. The proposed approach is validated on three representative structural systems subjected to synthetic or recorded ground motions. Results show that the proposed approach consistently improves prediction accuracy over baseline models, particularly in data-scarce regimes. These findings demonstrate the potential of physics-guided operator learning for reliable and data-efficient modeling of nonlinear structural seismic responses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy-Based Trajectory Clustering in Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09202v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel task of clustering trajectories from offline reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, where each cluster center represents the policy that generated its trajectories. By leveraging the connection between the KL-divergence of offline trajectory distributions and a mixture of policy-induced distributions, we formulate a natural clustering objective. To solve this, we propose Policy-Guided K-means (PG-Kmeans) and Centroid-Attracted Autoencoder (CAAE). PG-Kmeans iteratively trains behavior cloning (BC) policies and assigns trajectories based on policy generation probabilities, while CAAE resembles the VQ-VAE framework by guiding the latent representations of trajectories toward the vicinity of specific codebook entries to achieve clustering. Theoretically, we prove the finite-step convergence of PG-Kmeans and identify a key challenge in offline trajectory clustering: the inherent ambiguity of optimal solutions due to policy-induced conflicts, which can result in multiple equally valid but structurally distinct clusterings. Experimentally, we validate our methods on the widely used D4RL dataset and custom GridWorld environments. Our results show that both PG-Kmeans and CAAE effectively partition trajectories into meaningful clusters. They offer a promising framework for policy-based trajectory clustering, with broad applications in offline RL and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Action: Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09990v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Chain-of-Action (CoA), a novel visuo-motor policy paradigm built upon Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling. Unlike conventional approaches that predict next step action(s) forward, CoA generates an entire trajectory by explicit backward reasoning with task-specific goals through an action-level Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process. This process is unified within a single autoregressive structure: (1) the first token corresponds to a stable keyframe action that encodes the task-specific goals; and (2) subsequent action tokens are generated autoregressively, conditioned on the initial keyframe and previously predicted actions. This backward action reasoning enforces a global-to-local structure, allowing each local action to be tightly constrained by the final goal. To further realize the action reasoning structure, CoA incorporates four complementary designs: continuous action token representation; dynamic stopping for variable-length trajectory generation; reverse temporal ensemble; and multi-token prediction to balance action chunk modeling with global structure. As a result, CoA gives strong spatial generalization capabilities while preserving the flexibility and simplicity of a visuo-motor policy. Empirically, we observe CoA achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 60 RLBench tasks and 8 real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ECAM: A Contrastive Learning Approach to Avoid Environmental Collision in Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09626v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory forecasting is crucial in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics and surveillance. Accurate forecasting requires models to consider various factors, including social interactions, multi-modal predictions, pedestrian intention and environmental context. While existing methods account for these factors, they often overlook the impact of the environment, which leads to collisions with obstacles. This paper introduces ECAM (Environmental Collision Avoidance Module), a contrastive learning-based module to enhance collision avoidance ability with the environment. The proposed module can be integrated into existing trajectory forecasting models, improving their ability to generate collision-free predictions. We evaluate our method on the ETH/UCY dataset and quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate its collision avoidance capabilities. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art methods significantly reduce (-40/50%) the collision rate when integrated with the proposed module. The code is available at https://github.com/CVML-CFU/ECAM.</p></details> | IJCNN 2025 |

To this end, an accurate prediction of dynamic obstacle trajectories is vital. Traditional approaches to trajectory prediction face limitations in generalizability and often fail to account for the intentions of other vessels. While recent research has considered incorporating the intentions of dynamic obstacles, these efforts are typically based on the own-ship's interpretation of the situation. The current state-of-the-art in this area is a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model, which infers target vessel intentions by considering multiple underlying causes and allowing for different interpretations of the situation by different vessels. However, since its inception, there have not been any significant structural improvements to this model. In this paper, we propose enhancing the DBN model by incorporating considerations for grounding hazards and vessel waypoint information. The proposed model is validated using real vessel encounters extracted from historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data.</p></details> | <details><summary>IMPOR...</summary><p>IMPORTANT: This preprint is not the final version.

However, these models still require task-specific fine-tuning in novel environments, a process that relies almost exclusively on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using static trajectory datasets. Such approaches neither allow robot to interact with environment nor do they leverage feedback from live execution. Also, their success is critically dependent on the size and quality of the collected trajectories. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by enabling closed-loop interaction and aligning learned policies directly with task objectives. In this work, we draw inspiration from the ideas of GRPO and propose the Trajectory-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO) method. By fusing step-level and trajectory-level advantage signals, this method improves GRPO's group-level advantage estimation, thereby making the algorithm more suitable for online reinforcement learning training of VLA. Experimental results on ten manipulation tasks from the libero-object benchmark demonstrate that TGRPO consistently outperforms various baseline methods, capable of generating more robust and efficient policies across multiple tested scenarios.

| **[What is the Cost of Differential Privacy for Deep Learning-Based Trajectory Generation?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09312v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While location trajectories offer valuable insights, they also reveal sensitive personal information. Differential Privacy (DP) offers formal protection, but achieving a favourable utility-privacy trade-off remains challenging. Recent works explore deep learning-based generative models to produce synthetic trajectories. However, current models lack formal privacy guarantees and rely on conditional information derived from real data during generation. This work investigates the utility cost of enforcing DP in such models, addressing three research questions across two datasets and eleven utility metrics. (1) We evaluate how DP-SGD, the standard DP training method for deep learning, affects the utility of state-of-the-art generative models. (2) Since DP-SGD is limited to unconditional models, we propose a novel DP mechanism for conditional generation that provides formal guarantees and assess its impact on utility. (3) We analyse how model types - Diffusion, VAE, and GAN - affect the utility-privacy trade-off. Our results show that DP-SGD significantly impacts performance, although some utility remains if the datasets is sufficiently large. The proposed DP mechanism improves training stability, particularly when combined with DP-SGD, for unstable models such as GANs and on smaller datasets. Diffusion models yield the best utility without guarantees, but with DP-SGD, GANs perform best, indicating that the best non-private model is not necessarily optimal when targeting formal guarantees. In conclusion, DP trajectory generation remains a challenging task, and formal guarantees are currently only feasible with large datasets and in constrained use cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Generative Vehicle Trajectory Models for Traffic Intersection Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08963v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic Intersections are vital to urban road networks as they regulate the movement of people and goods. However, they are regions of conflicting trajectories and are prone to accidents. Deep Generative models of traffic dynamics at signalized intersections can greatly help traffic authorities better understand the efficiency and safety aspects. At present, models are evaluated on computational metrics that primarily look at trajectory reconstruction errors. They are not evaluated online in a `live' microsimulation scenario. Further, these metrics do not adequately consider traffic engineering-specific concerns such as red-light violations, unallowed stoppage, etc. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analytics tool to train, run, and evaluate models with metrics that give better insights into model performance from a traffic engineering point of view. We train a state-of-the-art multi-vehicle trajectory forecasting model on a large dataset collected by running a calibrated scenario of a real-world urban intersection. We then evaluate the performance of the prediction models, online in a microsimulator, under unseen traffic conditions. We show that despite using ideally-behaved trajectories as input, and achieving low trajectory reconstruction errors, the generated trajectories show behaviors that break traffic rules. We introduce new metrics to evaluate such undesired behaviors and present our results.</p></details> |  |
| **[IntTrajSim: Trajectory Prediction for Simulating Multi-Vehicle driving at Signalized Intersections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08957v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic simulators are widely used to study the operational efficiency of road infrastructure, but their rule-based approach limits their ability to mimic real-world driving behavior. Traffic intersections are critical components of the road infrastructure, both in terms of safety risk (nearly 28% of fatal crashes and 58% of nonfatal crashes happen at intersections) as well as the operational efficiency of a road corridor. This raises an important question: can we create a data-driven simulator that can mimic the macro- and micro-statistics of the driving behavior at a traffic intersection? Deep Generative Modeling-based trajectory prediction models provide a good starting point to model the complex dynamics of vehicles at an intersection. But they are not tested in a "live" micro-simulation scenario and are not evaluated on traffic engineering-related metrics. In this study, we propose traffic engineering-related metrics to evaluate generative trajectory prediction models and provide a simulation-in-the-loop pipeline to do so. We also provide a multi-headed self-attention-based trajectory prediction model that incorporates the signal information, which outperforms our previous models on the evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[TraGraph-GS: Trajectory Graph-based Gaussian Splatting for Arbitrary Large-Scale Scene Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08704v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality novel view synthesis for large-scale scenes presents a challenging dilemma in 3D computer vision. Existing methods typically partition large scenes into multiple regions, reconstruct a 3D representation using Gaussian splatting for each region, and eventually merge them for novel view rendering. They can accurately render specific scenes, yet they do not generalize effectively for two reasons: (1) rigid spatial partition techniques struggle with arbitrary camera trajectories, and (2) the merging of regions results in Gaussian overlap to distort texture details. To address these challenges, we propose TraGraph-GS, leveraging a trajectory graph to enable high-precision rendering for arbitrarily large-scale scenes. We present a spatial partitioning method for large-scale scenes based on graphs, which incorporates a regularization constraint to enhance the rendering of textures and distant objects, as well as a progressive rendering strategy to mitigate artifacts caused by Gaussian overlap. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance both on four aerial and four ground datasets and highlight its remarkable efficiency: our method achieves an average improvement of 1.86 dB in PSNR on aerial datasets and 1.62 dB on ground datasets compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches struggle as they rely on static augmentations that fail under object deformations, occlusions, and camera movement, leading to inconsistent feature learning over time. We propose a motion-guided self-supervised learning framework that clusters dense point tracks to learn spatiotemporally consistent representations. By leveraging an off-the-shelf point tracker, we extract long-range motion trajectories and optimize feature clustering through a momentum-encoder-based optimal transport mechanism. To ensure temporal coherence, we propagate cluster assignments along tracked points, enforcing feature consistency across views despite viewpoint changes. Integrating motion as an implicit supervisory signal, our method learns representations that generalize across frames, improving robustness in dynamic scenes and challenging occlusion scenarios. By initializing from strong image-pretrained models and leveraging video data for training, we improve state-of-the-art by 1% to 6% on six image and video datasets and four evaluation benchmarks.

| **[FlickerFusion: Intra-trajectory Domain Generalizing Multi-Agent RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15876v4)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing complex cooperative tasks across various real-world applications. However, existing MARL approaches often rely on the restrictive assumption that the number of entities (e.g., agents, obstacles) remains constant between training and inference. This overlooks scenarios where entities are dynamically removed or added during the inference trajectory -- a common occurrence in real-world environments like search and rescue missions and dynamic combat situations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of intra-trajectory dynamic entity composition under zero-shot out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, where such dynamic changes cannot be anticipated beforehand. Our empirical studies reveal that existing MARL methods suffer significant performance degradation and increased uncertainty in these scenarios. In response, we propose FlickerFusion, a novel OOD generalization method that acts as a universally applicable augmentation technique for MARL backbone methods. FlickerFusion stochastically drops out parts of the observation space, emulating being in-domain when inferenced OOD. The results show that FlickerFusion not only achieves superior inference rewards but also uniquely reduces uncertainty vis-\`a-vis the backbone, compared to existing methods. Benchmarks, implementations, and model weights are organized and open-sourced at flickerfusion305.github.io, accompanied by ample demo video renderings.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

This growing deployment presents new challenges for UAV trajectory planning in complex urban environments. However, existing studies often overlook key factors, such as urban airspace constraints and economic efficiency, which are essential in low-altitude economy contexts. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is regarded as a promising solution to these issues, while its practical adoption remains limited by low learning efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel UAV trajectory planning framework that combines DRL with large language model (LLM) reasoning to enable safe, compliant, and economically viable path planning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across multiple metrics, including data collection rate, collision avoidance, successful landing, regulatory compliance, and energy efficiency. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach in addressing UAV trajectory planning key challenges under constraints of the low-altitude economy networking.</p></details> |  |
| **[ATI: Any Trajectory Instruction for Controllable Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22944v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a unified framework for motion control in video generation that seamlessly integrates camera movement, object-level translation, and fine-grained local motion using trajectory-based inputs. In contrast to prior methods that address these motion types through separate modules or task-specific designs, our approach offers a cohesive solution by projecting user-defined trajectories into the latent space of pre-trained image-to-video generation models via a lightweight motion injector. Users can specify keypoints and their motion paths to control localized deformations, entire object motion, virtual camera dynamics, or combinations of these. The injected trajectory signals guide the generative process to produce temporally consistent and semantically aligned motion sequences. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple video motion control tasks, including stylized motion effects (e.g., motion brushes), dynamic viewpoint changes, and precise local motion manipulation. Experiments show that our method provides significantly better controllability and visual quality compared to prior approaches and commercial solutions, while remaining broadly compatible with various state-of-the-art video generation backbones.

| **[Egocentric Event-Based Vision for Ping Pong Ball Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07860v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a real-time egocentric trajectory prediction system for table tennis using event cameras. Unlike standard cameras, which suffer from high latency and motion blur at fast ball speeds, event cameras provide higher temporal resolution, allowing more frequent state updates, greater robustness to outliers, and accurate trajectory predictions using just a short time window after the opponent's impact. We collect a dataset of ping-pong game sequences, including 3D ground-truth trajectories of the ball, synchronized with sensor data from the Meta Project Aria glasses and event streams. Our system leverages foveated vision, using eye-gaze data from the glasses to process only events in the viewer's fovea. This biologically inspired approach improves ball detection performance and significantly reduces computational latency, as it efficiently allocates resources to the most perceptually relevant regions, achieving a reduction factor of 10.81 on the collected trajectories. Our detection pipeline has a worst-case total latency of 4.5 ms, including computation and perception - significantly lower than a frame-based 30 FPS system, which, in the worst case, takes 66 ms solely for perception. Finally, we fit a trajectory prediction model to the estimated states of the ball, enabling 3D trajectory forecasting in the future. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to predict table tennis trajectories from an egocentric perspective using event cameras.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW), Nashville (TN), USA, 2025; 5th International Workshop on Event-Based Vision</p></details> |

In this paper, we reformulate the trajectory optimization of this kind of method, focusing on enhancing both reconstruction quality and efficiency. Initially, we navigate effective restoration paths through a reinforcement learning process, gradually steering potential trajectories toward the most precise options. Additionally, to mitigate the considerable computational burden associated with iterative sampling, we propose cost-aware trajectory distillation to streamline complex paths into several manageable steps with adaptable sizes. Moreover, we fine-tune a foundational diffusion model (FLUX) with 12B parameters by using our algorithms, producing a unified framework for handling 7 kinds of image restoration tasks. Extensive experiments showcase the $\textit{significant}$ superiority of the proposed method, achieving a maximum PSNR improvement of 2.1 dB over state-of-the-art methods, while also greatly enhancing visual perceptual quality.

Dataset augmentation through the addition of synthetically generated trajectory data is necessary to develop a more robust aircraft trajectory model and ensure that the trajectory dataset is sufficient and balanced. In this work, we propose a novel framework called ATRADA for aircraft trajectory dataset augmentation. In the proposed framework, a Transformer encoder learns the underlying patterns in the original trajectory dataset and converts each data point into a context vector in the learned latent space. The converted dataset in the latent space is projected into reduced dimensions using principal component analysis (PCA), and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied to fit the probability distribution of the data points in the reduced-dimensional space. Finally, new samples are drawn from the fitted GMM, the dimension of the samples is reverted to the original dimension, and they are decoded with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Several experiments demonstrate that the framework effectively generates new, high-quality synthetic aircraft trajectory data, which were compared to the results of several baselines.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the success of decoder-only models for language modeling, we propose DONUT, a Decoder-Only Network for Unrolling Trajectories. Different from existing encoder-decoder forecasting models, we encode historical trajectories and predict future trajectories with a single autoregressive model. This allows the model to make iterative predictions in a consistent manner, and ensures that the model is always provided with up-to-date information, enhancing the performance. Furthermore, inspired by multi-token prediction for language modeling, we introduce an 'overprediction' strategy that gives the network the auxiliary task of predicting trajectories at longer temporal horizons. This allows the model to better anticipate the future, and further improves the performance. With experiments, we demonstrate that our decoder-only approach outperforms the encoder-decoder baseline, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Argoverse 2 single-agent motion forecasting benchmark.</p></details> |  |

Our framework features a unified trajectory representation that encapsulates the kinematic models of both $SO(3)\times\mathbb{R}^3$ and $SE(3)$ pose representations. This encapsulation strategy allows users to use the same implementation of measurement-based factors for either choice of pose representation, which facilitates experimentation and comparison to achieve the best model for the ME task. In addition, unique to our framework, we derive the kinematic models with the closed-form temporal derivatives of the local variable of $SO(3)$ and $SE(3)$, which so far has only been approximated based on the Taylor expansion in the literature. Our experiments show that these kinematic models can improve the estimation accuracy in high-speed scenarios. All analytical Jacobians of the interpolated states with respect to the support states of the trajectory representation, as well as the motion prior factors, are also provided for accelerated Gauss-Newton (GN) optimization. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the framework in various motion estimation tasks such as localization, calibration, and odometry, facilitating fast prototyping for ME researchers.

We call this the \textit{continuous inverse problem} and start by rigorously defining its solution. We then develop a framework where the solution can be constructed as a limit of solutions to appropriately designed \textit{discrete inverse problems}, so that convergence holds in $p$-variation. Our approach is based on calibrating the bounded variation paths whose limit defines the rough path `lift' of path $X$ to rough path ${\bf X}$ to the observed trajectory $y$. Moreover, we develop a general numerical algorithm for constructing the solution to the discrete inverse problem. The core idea of the algorithm is to use the signature representation of the path, iterating between the response and the control, each time correcting according to the required properties. We apply our framework to the case where the geometric $p$-rough path ${\bf X}$ is defined as the limit of piecewise linear paths in the $p$-variation topology. We express the discrete inverse problem for a fixed observation rate as a solution to a system of equations driven by piecewise linear paths and prove convergence to the solution of the continuous inverse problem for observation time $\delta\to 0$. Finally, we show that, in this context, the numerical algorithm for solving the discrete inverse problem simplifies to an iterative simultaneous update of the local gradients and we prove that it converges in $p$-variation uniformly with respect to $\delta$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended updated version - 41 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

A key component is a robust trajectory scorer capable of selecting the optimal trajectory from these candidates. While recent trajectory scorers focus on scoring either large sets of static trajectories or small sets of dynamically generated ones, both approaches face significant limitations in generalization. Static vocabularies provide effective coarse discretization but struggle to make fine-grained adaptation, while dynamic proposals offer detailed precision but fail to capture broader trajectory distributions. To overcome these challenges, we propose GTRS (Generalized Trajectory Scoring), a unified framework for end-to-end multi-modal planning that combines coarse and fine-grained trajectory evaluation. GTRS consists of three complementary innovations: (1) a diffusion-based trajectory generator that produces diverse fine-grained proposals; (2) a vocabulary generalization technique that trains a scorer on super-dense trajectory sets with dropout regularization, enabling its robust inference on smaller subsets; and (3) a sensor augmentation strategy that enhances out-of-domain generalization while incorporating refinement training for critical trajectory discrimination. As the winning solution of the Navsim v2 Challenge, GTRS demonstrates superior performance even with sub-optimal sensor inputs, approaching privileged methods that rely on ground-truth perception.

Although some trajectory prediction methods have been developed to provide empirical robustness, these methods are heuristic and do not offer guaranteed robustness. In this work, we propose a certification approach tailored for trajectory prediction that provides guaranteed robustness. To this end, we address the unique challenges associated with trajectory prediction, such as unbounded outputs and multi-modality. To mitigate the inherent performance drop through certification, we propose a diffusion-based trajectory denoiser and integrate it into our method. Moreover, we introduce new certified performance metrics to reliably measure the trajectory prediction performance. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the certified predictors and highlight their advantages over the non-certified ones.

| **[Reusing Trajectories in Policy Gradients Enables Fast Convergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06178v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy gradient (PG) methods are a class of effective reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly when dealing with continuous control problems. These methods learn the parameters of parametric policies via stochastic gradient ascent, typically using on-policy trajectory data to estimate the policy gradient. However, such reliance on fresh data makes them sample-inefficient. Indeed, vanilla PG methods require $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ trajectories to reach an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point. A common strategy to improve efficiency is to reuse off-policy information from past iterations, such as previous gradients or trajectories. While gradient reuse has received substantial theoretical attention, leading to improved rates of $O(\epsilon^{-3/2})$, the reuse of past trajectories remains largely unexplored from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we provide the first rigorous theoretical evidence that extensive reuse of past off-policy trajectories can significantly accelerate convergence in PG methods. We introduce a power mean correction to the multiple importance weighting estimator and propose RPG (Retrospective Policy Gradient), a PG algorithm that combines old and new trajectories for policy updates. Through a novel analysis, we show that, under established assumptions, RPG achieves a sample complexity of $\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$, the best known rate in the literature. We further validate empirically our approach against PG methods with state-of-the-art rates.</p></details> |  |

To provide an optimized solution, we propose a cooperative trajectory optimization and task allocation framework leveraging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). This study integrates a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for efficient task allocation among multiple UAVs and UGVs, and employs an informed-RRT* (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star) algorithm for collision-free trajectory generation. Further optimization of task sequencing and path efficiency is conducted using Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). Simulation experiments conducted in a realistic post-disaster environment demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly improves the overall efficiency of medical rescue operations compared to traditional strategies, showing substantial reductions in total mission completion time and traveled distance. Additionally, the cooperative utilization of UAVs and UGVs effectively balances their complementary advantages, highlighting the system' s scalability and practicality for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose the Multidimensional Adaptive Coefficient (MAC), a plug-in module for flow and diffusion models that extends conventional unidimensional coefficients to multidimensional ones and enables inference trajectory-wise adaptation. MAC is trained via simulation-based feedback through adversarial refinement. Empirical results across diverse frameworks and datasets demonstrate that MAC enhances generative quality with high training efficiency. Consequently, our work offers a new perspective on inference trajectory optimality, encouraging future research to move beyond vector field design and to leverage training-efficient, simulation-based optimization.</p></details> | ICML 2025 Paper |

Specifically, we consider a single UAV with 3 degree-of-freedom dynamics tasked with delivering blood packages to multiple hospitals, each with a predefined time window and priority. Mission objectives are encoded using Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enabling the formal specification of spatial-temporal constraints. To ensure safety, city buildings are modeled as 3D convex obstacles, and obstacle avoidance is handled through a Convex Feasible Set (CFS) method. The entire planning problem-combining UAV dynamics, STL satisfaction, and collision avoidance-is formulated as a convex optimization problem that ensures tractability and can be solved efficiently using standard convex programming techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method generates dynamically feasible, collision-free trajectories that satisfy temporal mission goals, providing a scalable and reliable approach for autonomous UAV-based medical logistics.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[State-Covering Trajectory Stitching for Diffusion Planners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00895v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models are emerging as powerful tools for long-horizon planning in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly with offline datasets. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality and diversity of training data. This often restricts their generalization to tasks outside their training distribution or longer planning horizons. To overcome this challenge, we propose State-Covering Trajectory Stitching (SCoTS), a novel reward-free trajectory augmentation method that incrementally stitches together short trajectory segments, systematically generating diverse and extended trajectories. SCoTS first learns a temporal distance-preserving latent representation that captures the underlying temporal structure of the environment, then iteratively stitches trajectory segments guided by directional exploration and novelty to effectively cover and expand this latent space. We demonstrate that SCoTS significantly improves the performance and generalization capabilities of diffusion planners on offline goal-conditioned benchmarks requiring stitching and long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, augmented trajectories generated by SCoTS significantly improve the performance of widely used offline goal-conditioned RL algorithms across diverse environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Entropy: Modeling Game State Stability from Multimodality Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05810v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex interactions among agents present a significant challenge for autonomous driving in real-world scenarios. Recently, a promising approach has emerged, which formulates the interactions of agents as a level-k game framework. It effectively decouples agent policies by hierarchical game levels. However, this framework ignores both the varying driving complexities among agents and the dynamic changes in agent states across game levels, instead treating them uniformly. Consequently, redundant and error-prone computations are introduced into this framework. To tackle the issue, this paper proposes a metric, termed as Trajectory Entropy, to reveal the game status of agents within the level-k game framework. The key insight stems from recognizing the inherit relationship between agent policy uncertainty and the associated driving complexity. Specifically, Trajectory Entropy extracts statistical signals representing uncertainty from the multimodality trajectory prediction results of agents in the game. Then, the signal-to-noise ratio of this signal is utilized to quantify the game status of agents. Based on the proposed Trajectory Entropy, we refine the current level-k game framework through a simple gating mechanism, significantly improving overall accuracy while reducing computational costs. Our method is evaluated on the Waymo and nuPlan datasets, in terms of trajectory prediction, open-loop and closed-loop planning tasks. The results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method, with precision improved by up to 19.89% for prediction and up to 16.48% for planning.</p></details> | 10 pages |

To overcome the ambiguity in 3D from 2D estimation, we design an LSTM-based pipeline that utilizes a novel canonical 3D representation that is independent of the camera's location to handle arbitrary views and a series of intermediate representations that encourage crucial invariance and reprojection consistency. We evaluated our method on four synthetic and three real datasets and conducted extensive ablation studies on our design choices. Despite training solely on simulated data, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and can generalize to real-world scenarios with multiple trajectories, opening up a range of applications in sport analysis and virtual replay.

| **[BiTrajDiff: Bidirectional Trajectory Generation with Diffusion Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05762v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we analyze the anonymized Yjmob100k dataset, which captures the trajectories of 100,000 users in Japan, and demonstrate how existing anonymization techniques fail to protect their sensitive attributes. We leverage population density patterns, structural correlations, and temporal activity profiles to re-identify the dataset's real-world location and timing. Our results reveal that the anonymization process carried out for Yjmob100k is inefficient and preserves enough spatial and temporal structure to enable re-identification. This work underscores the limitations of current trajectory anonymization methods and calls for more robust privacy mechanisms in the publication of mobility data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Viewport Prediction for Volumetric Video Streaming by Exploring Video Saliency and Trajectory Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16462v3)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Volumetric video, also known as hologram video, is a novel medium that portrays natural content in Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR). It is expected to be the next-gen video technology and a prevalent use case for 5G and beyond wireless communication. Considering that each user typically only watches a section of the volumetric video, known as the viewport, it is essential to have precise viewport prediction for optimal performance. However, research on this topic is still in its infancy. In the end, this paper presents and proposes a novel approach, named Saliency and Trajectory Viewport Prediction (STVP), which aims to improve the precision of viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. The STVP extensively utilizes video saliency information and viewport trajectory. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. In particular, we introduce a novel sampling method, Uniform Random Sampling (URS), to reduce computational complexity while still preserving video features in an efficient manner. Then we present a saliency detection technique that incorporates both spatial and temporal information for detecting static, dynamic geometric, and color salient regions. Finally, we intelligently fuse saliency and trajectory information to achieve more accurate viewport prediction. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed viewport prediction methods using state-of-the-art volumetric video sequences. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method over existing schemes. The dataset and source code will be publicly accessible after acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a structured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model, EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models, while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories, inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs, lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and personalized healthcare.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a novel model predictive control (MPC) method for MS-AGV trajectory tracking that takes tire wear minimization consideration in the objective function. To speed up the problem-solving process, we propose a hierarchical controller design and simplify the dynamic model by integrating the \textit{magic formula tire model} and \textit{simplified tire wear model}. In the experiment, the proposed method can be solved by simulated annealing in real-time on a normal personal computer and by incorporating tire wear into the objective function, tire wear is reduced by 19.19\% while maintaining the tracking accuracy in curve-tracking experiments. In the more challenging scene: the desired trajectory is offset by 60 degrees from the vehicle's heading, the reduction in tire wear increased to 65.20\% compared to the kinematic model without considering the tire wear optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Journal of Automation and Intelligence</p></details> |

Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos offers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and simplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While imitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert demonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements, learning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios. To address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with Equivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models expert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the stochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual representation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a diffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and sampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization. Additionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric symmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process. To address state mismatches, we develop a forward-process guided action inference strategy for conditional sampling. Using an ESD video dataset of nearly 2000 clips, experimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, both explicit and implicit, in trajectory prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of imitation learning to surgical skill development for dissection trajectory prediction.</p></details> |  |

The proposed approach incorporates a modular architecture that integrates state estimation, vehicle dynamics modeling, and optimization to ensure real-time performance. The state-space equations are formulated in a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) form, and a curvature-based tuning method is introduced to optimize weight matrices for varying trajectories. The MPC framework is implemented using the Robot Operating System (ROS) for parallel execution of state estimation and control optimization, ensuring scalability and minimal latency. Extensive simulations and real-time experiments were conducted on multiple predefined trajectories, demonstrating high accuracy with minimal cross-track and orientation errors, even under aggressive maneuvers and high-speed conditions. The results highlight the robustness and adaptability of the proposed system, achieving seamless alignment between simulated and real-world performance. This work lays the foundation for dynamic weight tuning and integration into cooperative autonomous navigation systems, paving the way for enhanced safety and efficiency in autonomous driving applications.</p></details> |  |

Training models to generate such manipulation trajectories requires a large and diverse collection of detailed manipulation demonstrations for various objects, which is nearly unfeasible to gather at scale. In this paper, we propose a framework that leverages large-scale ego- and exo-centric video datasets -- constructed globally with substantial effort -- of Exo-Ego4D to extract diverse manipulation trajectories at scale. From these extracted trajectories with the associated textual action description, we develop trajectory generation models based on visual and point cloud-based language models. In the recently proposed egocentric vision-based in-a-quality trajectory dataset of HOT3D, we confirmed that our models successfully generate valid object trajectories, establishing a training dataset and baseline models for the novel task of generating 6DoF manipulation trajectories from action descriptions in egocentric vision.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Traditional site selection methods often rely on static traffic counts or subjective assessments. This research introduces a data-driven methodology to objectively quantify location visibility by analyzing large-scale connected vehicle trajectory data (sourced from Compass IoT) within urban environments. We model the dynamic driver field-of-view using a forward-projected visibility area for each vehicle position derived from interpolated trajectories. By integrating this with building vertex locations extracted from OpenStreetMap, we quantify the cumulative visual exposure, or ``visibility count'', for thousands of potential points of interest near roadways. The analysis reveals that visibility is highly concentrated, identifying specific ``visual hotspots'' that receive disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. The core technical contribution involves the construction of a BallTree spatial index over building vertices. This enables highly efficient (O(logN) complexity) radius queries to determine which vertices fall within the viewing circles of millions of trajectory points across numerous trips, significantly outperforming brute-force geometric checks. Analysis reveals two key findings: 1) Visibility is highly concentrated, identifying distinct 'visual hotspots' receiving disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. 2) The aggregated visibility counts across vertices conform to a Log-Normal distribution.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate how a state-augmented graph neural network (GNN) parametrization for the resource allocation policy circumvents the drawbacks of the ubiquitous dual subgradient methods by representing the network configurations (or states) as graphs and viewing dual variables as dynamic inputs to the model, viewed as graph signals supported over the graphs. Lagrangian maximizing state-augmented policies are learned during the offline training phase, and the dual variables evolve through gradient updates while executing the learned state-augmented policies during the inference phase. Our main contributions are to illustrate how near-optimal initialization of dual multipliers for faster inference can be accomplished with dual variable regression, leveraging a secondary GNN parametrization, and how maximization of the Lagrangian over the multipliers sampled from the dual descent dynamics substantially improves the training of state-augmented models. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm with extensive numerical experiments in a case study of transmit power control. Finally, we prove a convergence result and an exponential probability bound on the excursions of the dual function (iterate) optimality gaps.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE TSP for possible publication</p></details> |

Despite its importance, research in this area has been largely unexplored in terms of (1) a clear understanding of what induces individual unfairness in GNNs and (2) a comprehensive consideration of identifying similar individuals. To bridge these gaps, we conduct a preliminary analysis to explore the underlying reason for individual unfairness and observe correlations between IF and similarity consistency, a concept introduced to evaluate the discrepancy in identifying similar individuals based on graph structure versus node features. Inspired by our observations, we introduce two metrics to assess individual similarity from two distinct perspectives: topology fusion and feature fusion. Building upon these metrics, we propose Similarity-aware GNNs for Individual Fairness, named SaGIF. The key insight behind SaGIF is the integration of individual similarities by independently learning similarity representations, leading to an improvement of IF in GNNs. Our experiments on several real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed metrics and SaGIF. Specifically, SaGIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art IF methods while maintaining utility performance. Code is available at: https://github.com/ZzoomD/SaGIF.</p></details> | Under review |

Large amounts of chemical and process data are proprietary to chemical companies and are therefore locked in data silos, hindering the training of ML models on large data sets in chemical engineering. Recently, the concept of federated learning has gained increasing attention in ML research, enabling organizations to jointly train machine learning models without disclosure of their individual data. We discuss potential applications of federated learning in several fields of chemical engineering, from the molecular to the process scale. In addition, we apply federated learning in two exemplary case studies that simulate practical scenarios of multiple chemical companies holding proprietary data sets: (i) prediction of binary mixture activity coefficients with graph neural networks and (ii) system identification of a distillation column with autoencoders. Our results indicate that ML models jointly trained with federated learning yield significantly higher accuracy than models trained by each chemical company individually and can perform similarly to models trained on combined datasets from all companies. Federated learning has therefore great potential to advance ML models in chemical engineering while respecting corporate data privacy, making it promising for future industrial applications.</p></details> |  |

We present latent diffusion for full protein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom protein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural network (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein conformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind, sequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent representations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by dihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a 2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D2 receptor in a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategy reproduces the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom lDDT of approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8) and recovers backbone and side-chain dihedral-angle distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of less than 0.03 compared to the MD data. LD-FPG thereby offers a practical route to system-specific, all-atom ensemble generation for large proteins, providing a promising tool for structure-based therapeutic design on complex, dynamic targets. The D2R-MD dataset and our implementation are freely available to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (main text), 4 figures, 2 tables.

A typical scenario involves scammers deploying honeypot contracts to attract investments, restricting token sales, and draining the funds, which leaves investors with worthless tokens. Current methods either rely on predefined patterns to detect code risks or utilize statistical transaction data to train detection models. However, real-world Rug Pull schemes often involve a complex interplay between malicious code and suspicious transaction behaviors. These methods, which solely focus on one aspect, fall short in detecting such schemes effectively. In this paper, we propose RPhunter, a novel technique that integrates code and transaction for Rug Pull detection. First, RPhunter establishes declarative rules and performs flow analysis to extract code risk information, further constructing a semantic risk code graph (SRCG). Meanwhile, to leverage transaction information, RPhunter formulates dynamic token transaction activities as a token flow behavior graph (TFBG) in which nodes and edges are characterized from network structure and market manipulation perspectives. Finally, RPhunter employs graph neural networks to extract complementary features from SRCG and TFBG, integrating them through an attention fusion model to enhance the detection of Rug Pull. We manually analyzed 645 Rug Pull incidents from code and transaction aspects and constructed a ground-truth dataset. We evaluated RPhunter on our dataset, achieving a precision of 95.3%, a recall of 93.8% and an F1 score of 94.5%, which highlights superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, when applied to the real-world scenarios, RPhunter has identified 4801 Rug Pull tokens, achieving a precision of 91%.</p></details> |  |

The key to effective multi-scenario recommendation lies in capturing both user preferences shared across all scenarios and scenario-aware preferences specific to each scenario. However, existing methods often overlook user-specific modeling, limiting the generation of personalized user representations. To address this, we propose PERSCEN, an innovative approach that incorporates user-specific modeling into multi-scenario matching. PERSCEN constructs a user-specific feature graph based on user characteristics and employs a lightweight graph neural network to capture higher-order interaction patterns, enabling personalized extraction of preferences shared across scenarios. Additionally, we leverage vector quantization techniques to distil scenario-aware preferences from users' behavior sequence within individual scenarios, facilitating user-specific and scenario-aware preference modeling. To enhance efficient and flexible information transfer, we introduce a progressive scenario-aware gated linear unit that allows fine-grained, low-latency fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PERSCEN outperforms existing methods. Further efficiency analysis confirms that PERSCEN effectively balances performance with computational cost, ensuring its practicality for real-world industrial systems.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

We developed a modular robot E-skin, composed of multiple irregularly shaped skin patches, which can be assembled to cover the robot's body while capturing real-time pressure and pose data from thousands of sensing points. To process this information, we propose an equivariant graph neural network-based recognizer that efficiently and accurately classifies diverse tactile gestures, including poke, grab, stroke, and double-pat. By mapping the recognized gestures to predefined robot actions, we enable intuitive human-robot interaction purely through tactile input.</p></details> |  |

A critical step in static analysis is building accurate call graphs that model function calls in a program. However, due to hard-to-analyze language features, existing call graph construction algorithms for JavaScript are neither sound nor complete. Prior work shows that even advanced solutions produce false edges and miss valid ones. In this work, we assist these tools by identifying missed call edges. Our main idea is to frame the problem as link prediction on full program graphs, using a rich representation with multiple edge types. Our approach, GRAPHIA, leverages recent advances in graph neural networks to model non-local relationships between code elements. Concretely, we propose representing JavaScript programs using a combination of syntactic- and semantic-based edges. GRAPHIA can learn from imperfect labels, including static call edges from existing tools and dynamic edges from tests, either from the same or different projects. Because call graphs are sparse, standard machine learning metrics like ROC are not suitable. Instead, we evaluate GRAPHIA by ranking function definitions for each unresolved call site. We conduct a large-scale evaluation on 50 popular JavaScript libraries with 163K call edges (150K static and 13K dynamic). GRAPHIA builds program graphs with 6.6M structural and 386K semantic edges. It ranks the correct target as the top candidate in over 42% of unresolved cases and within the top 5 in 72% of cases, reducing the manual effort needed for analysis. Our results show that learning-based methods can improve the recall of JavaScript call graph construction. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply GNN-based link prediction to full multi-file program graphs for interprocedural analysis.</p></details> |  |

For non-Euclidean data, e.g., graphs, that particularly involves topological structures, one important aspect neglected by prior studies is how machine learning models generalize under topological shifts. This paper proposes Advective Diffusion Transformer (AdvDIFFormer), a physics-inspired graph Transformer model designed to address this challenge. The model is derived from advective diffusion equations which describe a class of continuous message passing process with observed and latent topological structures. We show that AdvDIFFormer has provable capability for controlling generalization error with topological shifts, which in contrast cannot be guaranteed by graph diffusion models, i.e., the generalized formulation of common graph neural networks in continuous space. Empirically, the model demonstrates superiority in various predictive tasks across information networks, molecular screening and protein interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Rumor Detection on Social Media with Reinforcement Learning-based Key Propagation Graph Generator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13094v2)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spread of rumors on social media, particularly during significant events like the US elections and the COVID-19 pandemic, poses a serious threat to social stability and public health. Current rumor detection methods primarily rely on propagation graphs to improve the model performance. However, the effectiveness of these methods is often compromised by noisy and irrelevant structures in the propagation process. To tackle this issue, techniques such as weight adjustment and data augmentation have been proposed. However, they depend heavily on rich original propagation structures, limiting their effectiveness in handling rumors that lack sufficient propagation information, especially in the early stages of dissemination. In this work, we introduce the Key Propagation Graph Generator (KPG), a novel reinforcement learning-based framework, that generates contextually coherent and informative propagation patterns for events with insufficient topology information and identifies significant substructures in events with redundant and noisy propagation structures. KPG comprises two key components: the Candidate Response Generator (CRG) and the Ending Node Selector (ENS). CRG learns latent variable distributions from refined propagation patterns to eliminate noise and generate new candidates for ENS, while ENS identifies the most influential substructures in propagation graphs and provides training data for CRG. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end framework that utilizes rewards derived from a pre-trained graph neural network to guide the training process. The resulting key propagation graphs are then employed in downstream rumor detection tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrate that KPG outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Cancer Gene Identification through Graph Anomaly Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17240v2)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in integrating protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks for identifying cancer genes in recent studies. However, due to the insufficient modeling of the biological information in PPI networks, more faithfully depiction of complex protein interaction patterns for cancer genes within the graph structure remains largely unexplored. This study takes a pioneering step toward bridging biological anomalies in protein interactions caused by cancer genes to statistical graph anomaly. We find a unique graph anomaly exhibited by cancer genes, namely weight heterogeneity, which manifests as significantly higher variance in edge weights of cancer gene nodes within the graph. Additionally, from the spectral perspective, we demonstrate that the weight heterogeneity could lead to the "flattening out" of spectral energy, with a concentration towards the extremes of the spectrum. Building on these insights, we propose the HIerarchical-Perspective Graph Neural Network (HIPGNN) that not only determines spectral energy distribution variations on the spectral perspective, but also perceives detailed protein interaction context on the spatial perspective. Extensive experiments are conducted on two reprocessed datasets STRINGdb and CPDB, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of HIPGNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[SliceGX: Layer-wise GNN Explanation with Model-slicing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17977v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the trustworthiness of graph neural networks (GNNs) as black-box models requires effective explanation methods. Existing GNN explanations typically apply input perturbations to identify subgraphs that are responsible for the occurrence of the final output of GNNs. However, such approaches lack finer-grained, layer-wise analysis of how intermediate representations contribute to the final result, capabilities that are crucial for model diagnosis and architecture optimization. This paper introduces SliceGX, a novel GNN explanation approach that generates explanations at specific GNN layers in a progressive manner. Given a GNN M, a set of selected intermediate layers, and a target layer, SliceGX automatically segments M into layer blocks ("model slice") and discovers high-quality explanatory subgraphs in each layer block that clarifies the occurrence of output of M at the targeted layer. Although finding such layer-wise explanations is computationally challenging, we develop efficient algorithms and optimization techniques that incrementally generate and maintain these subgraphs with provable approximation guarantees. Additionally, SliceGX offers a SPARQL-like query interface, providing declarative access and search capacities for the generated explanations. Through experiments on large real-world graphs and representative GNN architectures, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of SliceGX, and illustrate its practical utility in supporting model debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling Molecular Moieties through Hierarchical Grad-CAM Graph Explainability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01744v5)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Virtual Screening (VS) has become an essential tool in drug discovery, enabling the rapid and cost-effective identification of potential bioactive molecules. Among recent advancements, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained prominence for their ability to model complex molecular structures using graph-based representations. However, the integration of explainable methods to elucidate the specific contributions of molecular substructures to biological activity remains a significant challenge. This limitation hampers both the interpretability of predictive models and the rational design of novel therapeutics. Results: We trained 20 GNN models on a dataset of small molecules with the goal of predicting their activity on 20 distinct protein targets from the Kinase family. These classifiers achieved state-of-the-art performance in virtual screening tasks, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness on different targets. Building upon these models, we implemented the Hierarchical Grad-CAM graph Explainer (HGE) framework, enabling an in-depth analysis of the molecular moieties driving protein-ligand binding stabilization. HGE exploits Grad-CAM explanations at the atom, ring, and whole-molecule levels, leveraging the message-passing mechanism to highlight the most relevant chemical moieties. Validation against experimental data from the literature confirmed the ability of the explainer to recognize a molecular pattern of drugs and correctly annotate them to the known target. Conclusion: Our approach may represent a valid support to shorten both the screening and the hit discovery process. Detailed knowledge of the molecular substructures that play a role in the binding process can help the computational chemist to gain insights into the structure optimization, as well as in drug repurposing tasks.</p></details> |  |

Supply chains are inherently graph-like, making them ideal for GNN methodologies, which can optimize and solve complex problems. The barriers include a lack of proper conceptual foundations, familiarity with graph applications in SCM, and real-world benchmark datasets for GNN-based supply chain research. To address this, we discuss and connect supply chains with graph structures for effective GNN application, providing detailed formulations, examples, mathematical definitions, and task guidelines. Additionally, we present a multi-perspective real-world benchmark dataset from a leading FMCG company in Bangladesh, focusing on supply chain planning. We discuss various supply chain tasks using GNNs and benchmark several state-of-the-art models on homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs across six supply chain analytics tasks. Our analysis shows that GNN-based models consistently outperform statistical Machine Learning and other Deep Learning models by around 10-30% in regression, 10-30% in classification and detection tasks, and 15-40% in anomaly detection tasks on designated metrics. With this work, we lay the groundwork for solving supply chain problems using GNNs, supported by conceptual discussions, methodological insights, and a comprehensive dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 Pa...</summary><p>27 Pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2401.15299</p></details> |
| **[TROJAN-GUARD: Hardware Trojans Detection Using GNN in RTL Designs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17894v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chip manufacturing is a complex process, and to achieve a faster time to market, an increasing number of untrusted third-party tools and designs from around the world are being utilized. The use of these untrusted third party intellectual properties (IPs) and tools increases the risk of adversaries inserting hardware trojans (HTs). The covert nature of HTs poses significant threats to cyberspace, potentially leading to severe consequences for national security, the economy, and personal privacy. Many graph neural network (GNN)-based HT detection methods have been proposed. However, they perform poorly on larger designs because they rely on training with smaller designs. Additionally, these methods do not explore different GNN models that are well-suited for HT detection or provide efficient training and inference processes. We propose a novel framework that generates graph embeddings for large designs (e.g., RISC-V) and incorporates various GNN models tailored for HT detection. Furthermore, our framework introduces domain-specific techniques for efficient training and inference by implementing model quantization. Model quantization reduces the precision of the weights, lowering the computational requirements, enhancing processing speed without significantly affecting detection accuracy. We evaluate our framework using a custom dataset, and our results demonstrate a precision of 98.66% and a recall (true positive rate) of 92.30%, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in detecting hardware trojans in large-scale chip designs</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Unified Textual Graph Framework for Spectral Reasoning via Physical and Chemical Information Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17761v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the limitations of current spectral analysis methods-such as reliance on single-modality data, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability-we propose a novel multi-modal spectral analysis framework that integrates prior knowledge graphs with Large Language Models. Our method explicitly bridges physical spectral measurements and chemical structural semantics by representing them in a unified Textual Graph format, enabling flexible, interpretable, and generalizable spectral understanding. Raw spectra are first transformed into TAGs, where nodes and edges are enriched with textual attributes describing both spectral properties and chemical context. These are then merged with relevant prior knowledge-including functional groups and molecular graphs-to form a Task Graph that incorporates "Prompt Nodes" supporting LLM-based contextual reasoning. A Graph Neural Network further processes this structure to complete downstream tasks. This unified design enables seamless multi-modal integration and automated feature decoding with minimal manual annotation. Our framework achieves consistently high performance across multiple spectral analysis tasks, including node-level, edge-level, and graph-level classification. It demonstrates robust generalization in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, highlighting its effectiveness in learning from limited data and supporting in-context reasoning. This work establishes a scalable and interpretable foundation for LLM-driven spectral analysis, unifying physical and chemical modalities for scientific applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[G-Adaptivity: optimised graph-based mesh relocation for finite element methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04516v3)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel, and effective, approach to achieve optimal mesh relocation in finite element methods (FEMs). The cost and accuracy of FEMs is critically dependent on the choice of mesh points. Mesh relocation (r-adaptivity) seeks to optimise the mesh geometry to obtain the best solution accuracy at given computational budget. Classical r-adaptivity relies on the solution of a separate nonlinear "meshing" PDE to determine mesh point locations. This incurs significant cost at remeshing, and relies on estimates that relate interpolation- and FEM-error. Recent machine learning approaches have focused on the construction of fast surrogates for such classical methods. Instead, our new approach trains a graph neural network (GNN) to determine mesh point locations by directly minimising the FE solution error from the PDE system Firedrake to achieve higher solution accuracy. Our GNN architecture closely aligns the mesh solution space to that of classical meshing methodologies, thus replacing classical estimates for optimality with a learnable strategy. This allows for rapid and robust training and results in an extremely efficient and effective GNN approach to online r-adaptivity. Our method outperforms both classical, and prior ML, approaches to r-adaptive meshing. In particular, it achieves lower FE solution error, whilst retaining the significant speed-up over classical methods observed in prior ML work.</p></details> |  |
| **[CEGA: A Cost-Effective Approach for Graph-Based Model Extraction and Acquisition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17709v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable utility across diverse applications, and their growing complexity has made Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) a viable platform for scalable deployment. However, this accessibility also exposes GNN to serious security threats, most notably model extraction attacks (MEAs), in which adversaries strategically query a deployed model to construct a high-fidelity replica. In this work, we evaluate the vulnerability of GNNs to MEAs and explore their potential for cost-effective model acquisition in non-adversarial research settings. Importantly, adaptive node querying strategies can also serve a critical role in research, particularly when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming. By selectively sampling informative nodes, researchers can train high-performing GNNs with minimal supervision, which is particularly valuable in domains such as biomedicine, where annotations often require expert input. To address this, we propose a node querying strategy tailored to a highly practical yet underexplored scenario, where bulk queries are prohibited, and only a limited set of initial nodes is available. Our approach iteratively refines the node selection mechanism over multiple learning cycles, leveraging historical feedback to improve extraction efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmark graph datasets demonstrate our superiority over comparable baselines on accuracy, fidelity, and F1 score under strict query-size constraints. These results highlight both the susceptibility of deployed GNNs to extraction attacks and the promise of ethical, efficient GNN acquisition methods to support low-resource research environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Machine Learning Algorithms using Path Signatures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17634v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interface between stochastic analysis and machine learning is a rapidly evolving field, with path signatures - iterated integrals that provide faithful, hierarchical representations of paths - offering a principled and universal feature map for sequential and structured data. Rooted in rough path theory, path signatures are invariant to reparameterization and well-suited for modelling evolving dynamics, long-range dependencies, and irregular sampling - common challenges in real-world time series and graph data. This thesis investigates how to harness the expressive power of path signatures within scalable machine learning pipelines. It introduces a suite of models that combine theoretical robustness with computational efficiency, bridging rough path theory with probabilistic modelling, deep learning, and kernel methods. Key contributions include: Gaussian processes with signature kernel-based covariance functions for uncertainty-aware time series modelling; the Seq2Tens framework, which employs low-rank tensor structure in the weight space for scalable deep modelling of long-range dependencies; and graph-based models where expected signatures over graphs induce hypo-elliptic diffusion processes, offering expressive yet tractable alternatives to standard graph neural networks. Further developments include Random Fourier Signature Features, a scalable kernel approximation with theoretical guarantees, and Recurrent Sparse Spectrum Signature Gaussian Processes, which combine Gaussian processes, signature kernels, and random features with a principled forgetting mechanism for multi-horizon time series forecasting with adaptive context length. We hope this thesis serves as both a methodological toolkit and a conceptual bridge, and provides a useful reference for the current state of the art in scalable, signature-based learning for sequential and structured data.</p></details> | PhD thesis |

Current methods often focus on detection accuracy but neglect response time, which is critical in time-sensitive driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce real-time anomaly detection for autonomous driving, prioritizing both minimal response time and high accuracy. We propose a novel multimodal asynchronous hybrid network that combines event streams from event cameras with image data from RGB cameras. Our network utilizes the high temporal resolution of event cameras through an asynchronous Graph Neural Network and integrates it with spatial features extracted by a CNN from RGB images. This combination effectively captures both the temporal dynamics and spatial details of the driving environment, enabling swift and precise anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and response time, achieving millisecond-level real-time performance.</p></details> | ICML 2025 Spotlight |

While a related task, audio fingerprinting, has made significant progress in accurately retrieving musical content under "real world" (noisy, reverberant) conditions, ASID systems struggle to identify samples that have undergone musical modifications. Thus, a system robust to common music production transformations such as time-stretching, pitch-shifting, effects processing, and underlying or overlaying music is an important open challenge. In this work, we propose a lightweight and scalable encoding architecture employing a Graph Neural Network within a contrastive learning framework. Our model uses only 9% of the trainable parameters compared to the current state-of-the-art system while achieving comparable performance, reaching a mean average precision (mAP) of 44.2%. To enhance retrieval quality, we introduce a two-stage approach consisting of an initial coarse similarity search for candidate selection, followed by a cross-attention classifier that rejects irrelevant matches and refines the ranking of retrieved candidates - an essential capability absent in prior models. In addition, because queries in real-world applications are often short in duration, we benchmark our system for short queries using new fine-grained annotations for the Sample100 dataset, which we publish as part of this work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Efficient Few-shot Graph Neural Architecture Search via Partitioning Gradient Contribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01231v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the weight coupling problem, certain studies introduced few-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods, which partition the supernet into multiple sub-supernets. However, these methods often suffer from computational inefficiency and tend to provide suboptimal partitioning schemes. To address this problem more effectively, we analyze the weight coupling problem from a novel perspective, which primarily stems from distinct modules in succeeding layers imposing conflicting gradient directions on the preceding layer modules. Based on this perspective, we propose the Gradient Contribution (GC) method that efficiently computes the cosine similarity of gradient directions among modules by decomposing the Vector-Jacobian Product during supernet backpropagation. Subsequently, the modules with conflicting gradient directions are allocated to distinct sub-supernets while similar ones are grouped together. To assess the advantages of GC and address the limitations of existing Graph Neural Architecture Search methods, which are limited to searching a single type of Graph Neural Networks (Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) or Graph Transformers (GTs)), we propose the Unified Graph Neural Architecture Search (UGAS) framework, which explores optimal combinations of MPNNs and GTs. The experimental results demonstrate that GC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in supernet partitioning quality and time efficiency. In addition, the architectures searched by UGAS+GC outperform both the manually designed GNNs and those obtained by existing NAS methods. Finally, ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of all proposed methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2025</p></details> |

This paper addresses this issue by introducing initialization methods that enhance signal propagation (SP) within GNNs. We propose three key metrics for effective SP in GNNs: forward propagation, backward propagation, and graph embedding variation (GEV). While the first two metrics derive from classical SP theory, the third is specifically designed for GNNs. We theoretically demonstrate that a broad range of commonly used initialization methods for GNNs, which exhibit performance degradation with increasing depth, fail to control these three metrics simultaneously. To deal with this limitation, a direct exploitation of the SP analysis--searching for weight initialization variances that optimize the three metrics--is shown to significantly enhance the SP in deep GCNs. This approach is called Signal Propagation on Graph-guided Initialization (SPoGInit). Our experiments demonstrate that SPoGInit outperforms commonly used initialization methods on various tasks and architectures. Notably, SPoGInit enables performance improvements as GNNs deepen, which represents a significant advancement in addressing depth-related challenges and highlights the validity and effectiveness of the SP analysis framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in TMLR (2025)</p></details> |
| **[SlepNet: Spectral Subgraph Representation Learning for Neural Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16602v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks have been useful in machine learning on graph-structured data, particularly for node classification and some types of graph classification tasks. However, they have had limited use in representing patterning of signals over graphs. Patterning of signals over graphs and in subgraphs carries important information in many domains including neuroscience. Neural signals are spatiotemporally patterned, high dimensional and difficult to decode. Graph signal processing and associated GCN models utilize the graph Fourier transform and are unable to efficiently represent spatially or spectrally localized signal patterning on graphs. Wavelet transforms have shown promise here, but offer non-canonical representations and cannot be tightly confined to subgraphs. Here we propose SlepNet, a novel GCN architecture that uses Slepian bases rather than graph Fourier harmonics. In SlepNet, the Slepian harmonics optimally concentrate signal energy on specifically relevant subgraphs that are automatically learned with a mask. Thus, they can produce canonical and highly resolved representations of neural activity, focusing energy of harmonics on areas of the brain which are activated. We evaluated SlepNet across three fMRI datasets, spanning cognitive and visual tasks, and two traffic dynamics datasets, comparing its performance against conventional GNNs and graph signal processing constructs. SlepNet outperforms the baselines in all datasets. Moreover, the extracted representations of signal patterns from SlepNet offers more resolution in distinguishing between similar patterns, and thus represent brain signaling transients as informative trajectories. Here we have shown that these extracted trajectory representations can be used for other downstream untrained tasks. Thus we establish that SlepNet is useful both for prediction and representation learning in spatiotemporal data.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScaleGNN: Towards Scalable Graph Neural Networks via Adaptive High-order Neighboring Feature Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15920v3)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance across diverse graph-based tasks by leveraging message passing to capture complex node relationships. However, when applied to large-scale real-world graphs, GNNs face two major challenges: First, it becomes increasingly difficult to ensure both scalability and efficiency, as the repeated aggregation of large neighborhoods leads to significant computational overhead; Second, the over-smoothing problem arises, where excessive or deep propagation makes node representations indistinguishable, severely hindering model expressiveness. To tackle these issues, we propose ScaleGNN, a novel framework that adaptively fuses multi-level graph features for both scalable and effective graph learning. ScaleGNN first constructs per-order neighbor matrices that capture only the exclusive structural information at each hop, avoiding the redundancy of conventional aggregation. A learnable fusion module then selectively integrates these features, emphasizing the most informative high-order neighbors. To further reduce redundancy and over-smoothing, we introduce a Local Contribution Score (LCS)-based masking mechanism to filter out less relevant high-order neighbors, ensuring that only the most meaningful information is aggregated. In addition, a task-aware feature fusion strategy dynamically balances low- and high-order information, preserving both local detail and global context without incurring excessive complexity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ScaleGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, highlighting its practical value for large-scale graph learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum-Informed Contrastive Learning with Dynamic Mixup Augmentation for Class-Imbalanced Expert Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13987v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Expert systems often operate in domains characterized by class-imbalanced tabular data, where detecting rare but critical instances is essential for safety and reliability. While conventional approaches, such as cost-sensitive learning, oversampling, and graph neural networks, provide partial solutions, they suffer from drawbacks like overfitting, label noise, and poor generalization in low-density regions. To address these challenges, we propose QCL-MixNet, a novel Quantum-Informed Contrastive Learning framework augmented with k-nearest neighbor (kNN) guided dynamic mixup for robust classification under imbalance. QCL-MixNet integrates three core innovations: (i) a Quantum Entanglement-inspired layer that models complex feature interactions through sinusoidal transformations and gated attention, (ii) a sample-aware mixup strategy that adaptively interpolates feature representations of semantically similar instances to enhance minority class representation, and (iii) a hybrid loss function that unifies focal reweighting, supervised contrastive learning, triplet margin loss, and variance regularization to improve both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on 18 real-world imbalanced datasets (binary and multi-class) demonstrate that QCL-MixNet consistently outperforms 20 state-of-the-art machine learning, deep learning, and GNN-based baselines in macro-F1 and recall, often by substantial margins. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of each architectural component. Our results establish QCL-MixNet as a new benchmark for tabular imbalance handling in expert systems. Theoretical analyses reinforce its expressiveness, generalization, and optimization robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sustainable Greenhouse Microclimate Modeling: A Comparative Analysis of Recurrent and Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17371v4)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems into greenhouses not only optimizes land use but also enhances sustainable agricultural practices by enabling dual benefits of food production and renewable energy generation. However, accurate prediction of internal environmental conditions is crucial to ensure optimal crop growth while maximizing energy production. This study introduces a novel application of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) to greenhouse microclimate modeling, comparing their performance with traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). While RNNs excel at temporal pattern recognition, they cannot explicitly model the directional relationships between environmental variables. Our STGNN approach addresses this limitation by representing these relationships as directed graphs, enabling the model to capture both environmental dependencies and their directionality. We benchmark RNNs against directed STGNNs on two 15-min-resolution datasets from Volos (Greece): a six-variable 2020 installation and a more complex eight-variable greenhouse monitored in autumn 2024. In the simpler 2020 case the RNN attains near-perfect accuracy, outperforming the STGNN. When additional drivers are available in 2024, the STGNN overtakes the RNN ($R^{2}=0.905$ vs $0.740$), demonstrating that explicitly modelling directional dependencies becomes critical as interaction complexity grows. These findings indicate when graph-based models are warranted and provide a stepping-stone toward digital twins that jointly optimise crop yield and PV power in agrivoltaic greenhouses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation Learning with Mutual Influence of Modalities for Node Classification in Multi-Modal Heterogeneous Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07895v3)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, numerous online platforms can be described as multi-modal heterogeneous networks (MMHNs), such as Douban's movie networks and Amazon's product review networks. Accurately categorizing nodes within these networks is crucial for analyzing the corresponding entities, which requires effective representation learning on nodes. However, existing multi-modal fusion methods often adopt either early fusion strategies which may lose the unique characteristics of individual modalities, or late fusion approaches overlooking the cross-modal guidance in GNN-based information propagation. In this paper, we propose a novel model for node classification in MMHNs, named Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Inter-Modal Attention (HGNN-IMA). It learns node representations by capturing the mutual influence of multiple modalities during the information propagation process, within the framework of heterogeneous graph transformer. Specifically, a nested inter-modal attention mechanism is integrated into the inter-node attention to achieve adaptive multi-modal fusion, and modality alignment is also taken into account to encourage the propagation among nodes with consistent similarities across all modalities. Moreover, an attention loss is augmented to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the model in the node classification task, providing an innovative view to handle multi-modal data, especially when accompanied with network structures.</p></details> |  |

These features are typically used as inputs to machine learning models and are represented in a tabular format. However, such approaches often overlook algorithm configurations, a key factor influencing performance. The relationships between algorithm operators, parameters, problem characteristics, and performance outcomes form a complex structure best represented as a graph. This work explores the use of heterogeneous graph data structures and graph neural networks to predict the performance of optimization algorithms by capturing the complex dependencies between problems, algorithm configurations, and performance outcomes. We focus on two modular frameworks, modCMA-ES and modDE, which decompose two widely used derivative-free optimization algorithms: the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) and differential evolution (DE). We evaluate 324 modCMA-ES and 576 modDE variants on 24 BBOB problems across six runtime budgets and two problem dimensions. Achieving up to 36.6% improvement in MSE over traditional tabular-based methods, this work highlights the potential of geometric learning in black-box optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Over-Squashing in Graph Neural Networks by Spectrum-Preserving Sparsification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16110v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The message-passing paradigm of Graph Neural Networks often struggles with exchanging information across distant nodes typically due to structural bottlenecks in certain graph regions, a limitation known as \textit{over-squashing}. To reduce such bottlenecks, \textit{graph rewiring}, which modifies graph topology, has been widely used. However, existing graph rewiring techniques often overlook the need to preserve critical properties of the original graph, e.g., \textit{spectral properties}. Moreover, many approaches rely on increasing edge count to improve connectivity, which introduces significant computational overhead and exacerbates the risk of over-smoothing. In this paper, we propose a novel graph rewiring method that leverages \textit{spectrum-preserving} graph \textit{sparsification}, for mitigating over-squashing. Our method generates graphs with enhanced connectivity while maintaining sparsity and largely preserving the original graph spectrum, effectively balancing structural bottleneck reduction and graph property preservation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its superiority over strong baseline methods in classification accuracy and retention of the Laplacian spectrum.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[KCES: Training-Free Defense for Robust Graph Neural Networks via Kernel Complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11611v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive success across a wide range of graph-based tasks, yet they remain highly vulnerable to small, imperceptible perturbations and adversarial attacks. Although numerous defense methods have been proposed to address these vulnerabilities, many rely on heuristic metrics, overfit to specific attack patterns, and suffer from high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose Kernel Complexity-Based Edge Sanitization (KCES), a training-free, model-agnostic defense framework. KCES leverages Graph Kernel Complexity (GKC), a novel metric derived from the graph's Gram matrix that characterizes GNN generalization via its test error bound. Building on GKC, we define a KC score for each edge, measuring the change in GKC when the edge is removed. Edges with high KC scores, typically introduced by adversarial perturbations, are pruned to mitigate their harmful effects, thereby enhancing GNNs' robustness. KCES can also be seamlessly integrated with existing defense strategies as a plug-and-play module without requiring training. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that KCES consistently enhances GNN robustness, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, and amplifies the effectiveness of existing defenses, offering a principled and efficient solution for securing GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Topology Actions for Power Grid Control: A Graph-Based Soft-Label Imitation Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15190v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rising proportion of renewable energy in the electricity mix introduces significant operational challenges for power grid operators. Effective power grid management demands adaptive decision-making strategies capable of handling dynamic conditions. With the increase in complexity, more and more Deep Learning (DL) approaches have been proposed to find suitable grid topologies for congestion management. In this work, we contribute to this research by introducing a novel Imitation Learning (IL) approach that leverages soft labels derived from simulated topological action outcomes, thereby capturing multiple viable actions per state. Unlike traditional IL methods that rely on hard labels to enforce a single optimal action, our method constructs soft labels that capture the effectiveness of actions that prove suitable in resolving grid congestion. To further enhance decision-making, we integrate Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to encode the structural properties of power grids, ensuring that the topology-aware representations contribute to better agent performance. Our approach significantly outperforms its hard-label counterparts as well as state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) baseline agents. Most notably, it achieves a 17% better performance compared to the greedy expert agent from which the imitation targets were derived.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML) - Applied Data Science Track</p></details> |
| **[KG-FGNN: Knowledge-guided GNN Foundation Model for Fertilisation-oriented Soil GHG Flux Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15896v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precision soil greenhouse gas (GHG) flux prediction is essential in agricultural systems for assessing environmental impacts, developing emission mitigation strategies and promoting sustainable agriculture. Due to the lack of advanced sensor and network technologies on majority of farms, there are challenges in obtaining comprehensive and diverse agricultural data. As a result, the scarcity of agricultural data seriously obstructs the application of machine learning approaches in precision soil GHG flux prediction. This research proposes a knowledge-guided graph neural network framework that addresses the above challenges by integrating knowledge embedded in an agricultural process-based model and graph neural network techniques. Specifically, we utilise the agricultural process-based model to simulate and generate multi-dimensional agricultural datasets for 47 countries that cover a wide range of agricultural variables. To extract key agricultural features and integrate correlations among agricultural features in the prediction process, we propose a machine learning framework that integrates the autoencoder and multi-target multi-graph based graph neural networks, which utilises the autoencoder to selectively extract significant agricultural features from the agricultural process-based model simulation data and the graph neural network to integrate correlations among agricultural features for accurately predict fertilisation-oriented soil GHG fluxes. Comprehensive experiments were conducted with both the agricultural simulation dataset and real-world agricultural dataset to evaluate the proposed approach in comparison with well-known baseline and state-of-the-art regression methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach provides superior accuracy and stability in fertilisation-oriented soil GHG prediction.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Effective Data Pruning through Score Extrapolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09010v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training advanced machine learning models demands massive datasets, resulting in prohibitive computational costs. To address this challenge, data pruning techniques identify and remove redundant training samples while preserving model performance. Yet, existing pruning techniques predominantly require a full initial training pass to identify removable samples, negating any efficiency benefits for single training runs. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel importance score extrapolation framework that requires training on only a small subset of data. We present two initial approaches in this framework - k-nearest neighbors and graph neural networks - to accurately predict sample importance for the entire dataset using patterns learned from this minimal subset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for 2 state-of-the-art pruning methods (Dynamic Uncertainty and TDDS), 4 different datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Places-365, and ImageNet), and 3 training paradigms (supervised, unsupervised, and adversarial). Our results indicate that score extrapolation is a promising direction to scale expensive score calculation methods, such as pruning, data attribution, or other tasks.</p></details> |  |

Although tremendous progress has been made to model dynamic spatiotemporal patterns of human activity, most existing methods, including spatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs), overlook physical constraints of spatial interactions and the over-smoothing phenomenon in spatial correlation modeling. To address these limitations, this work proposes a physics-informed deep learning framework, namely Gravity-informed Spatiotemporal Transformer (Gravityformer) by refining transformer attention to integrate the universal law of gravitation and explicitly incorporating constraints from spatial interactions. Specifically, it (1) estimates two spatially explicit mass parameters based on inflow and outflow, (2) models the likelihood of cross-unit interaction using closed-form solutions of spatial interactions to constrain spatial modeling randomness, and (3) utilizes the learned spatial interaction to guide and mitigate the over-smoothing phenomenon in transformer attention matrices. The underlying law of human activity can be explicitly modeled by the proposed adaptive gravity model. Moreover, a parallel spatiotemporal graph convolution transformer structure is proposed for achieving a balance between coupled spatial and temporal learning. Systematic experiments on six real-world large-scale activity datasets demonstrate the quantitative and qualitative superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art benchmarks. Additionally, the learned gravity attention matrix can be disentangled and interpreted based on geographical laws. This work provides a novel insight into integrating physical laws with deep learning for spatiotemporal predictive learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 13 figures, under review</p></details> |
| **[Over-squashing in Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15507v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains. However, recent theoretical advances have identified fundamental limitations in their information propagation capabilities, such as over-squashing, where distant nodes fail to effectively exchange information. While extensively studied in static contexts, this issue remains unexplored in Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), which process sequences associated with graph nodes. Nonetheless, the temporal dimension amplifies this challenge by increasing the information that must be propagated. In this work, we formalize the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem and demonstrate its distinct characteristics compared to the static case. Our analysis reveals that counterintuitively, convolutional STGNNs favor information propagation from points temporally distant rather than close in time. Moreover, we prove that architectures that follow either time-and-space or time-then-space processing paradigms are equally affected by this phenomenon, providing theoretical justification for computationally efficient implementations. We validate our findings on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing deeper insights into their operational dynamics and principled guidance for more effective designs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Graph Anomaly Detection: A Survey and New Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09957v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection (GAD), which aims to identify unusual graph instances (nodes, edges, subgraphs, or graphs), has attracted increasing attention in recent years due to its significance in a wide range of applications. Deep learning approaches, graph neural networks (GNNs) in particular, have been emerging as a promising paradigm for GAD, owing to its strong capability in capturing complex structure and/or node attributes in graph data. Considering the large number of methods proposed for GNN-based GAD, it is of paramount importance to summarize the methodologies and findings in the existing GAD studies, so that we can pinpoint effective model designs for tackling open GAD problems. To this end, in this work we aim to present a comprehensive review of deep learning approaches for GAD. Existing GAD surveys are focused on task-specific discussions, making it difficult to understand the technical insights of existing methods and their limitations in addressing some unique challenges in GAD. To fill this gap, we first discuss the problem complexities and their resulting challenges in GAD, and then provide a systematic review of current deep GAD methods from three novel perspectives of methodology, including GNN backbone design, proxy task design for GAD, and graph anomaly measures. To deepen the discussions, we further propose a taxonomy of 13 fine-grained method categories under these three perspectives to provide more in-depth insights into the model designs and their capabilities. To facilitate the experiments and validation, we also summarize a collection of widely-used GAD datasets and empirical comparison. We further discuss multiple open problems to inspire more future high-quality research. A continuously updated repository for datasets, links to the codes of algorithms, and empirical comparison is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/Awesome-Deep-Graph-Anomaly-Detection.</p></details> | Accepted by TKDE |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for Jamming Source Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03196v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based learning provides a powerful framework for modeling complex relational structures; however, its application within the domain of wireless security remains significantly underexplored. In this work, we introduce the first application of graph-based learning for jamming source localization, addressing the imminent threat of jamming attacks in wireless networks. Unlike geometric optimization techniques that struggle under environmental uncertainties and dense interference, we reformulate the localization as an inductive graph regression task. Our approach integrates structured node representations that encode local and global signal aggregation, ensuring spatial coherence and adaptive signal fusion. To enhance robustness, we incorporate an attention-based \ac{GNN} that adaptively refines neighborhood influence and introduces a confidence-guided estimation mechanism that dynamically balances learned predictions with domain-informed priors. We evaluate our approach under complex \ac{RF} environments with various sampling densities, network topologies, jammer characteristics, and signal propagation conditions, conducting comprehensive ablation studies on graph construction, feature selection, and pooling strategies. Results demonstrate that our novel graph-based learning framework significantly outperforms established localization baselines, particularly in challenging scenarios with sparse and obfuscated signal information.

| **[DOVA-PATBM: An Intelligent, Adaptive, and Scalable Framework for Optimizing Large-Scale EV Charging Infrastructure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15289v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accelerating uptake of battery-electric vehicles demands infrastructure planning tools that are both data-rich and geographically scalable. Whereas most prior studies optimise charging locations for single cities, state-wide and national networks must reconcile the conflicting requirements of dense metropolitan cores, car-dependent exurbs, and power-constrained rural corridors. We present DOVA-PATBM (Deployment Optimisation with Voronoi-oriented, Adaptive, POI-Aware Temporal Behaviour Model), a geo-computational framework that unifies these contexts in a single pipeline. The method rasterises heterogeneous data (roads, population, night lights, POIs, and feeder lines) onto a hierarchical H3 grid, infers intersection importance with a zone-normalised graph neural network centrality model, and overlays a Voronoi tessellation that guarantees at least one five-port DC fast charger within every 30 km radius. Hourly arrival profiles, learned from loop-detector and floating-car traces, feed a finite M/M/c queue to size ports under feeder-capacity and outage-risk constraints. A greedy maximal-coverage heuristic with income-weighted penalties then selects the minimum number of sites that satisfy coverage and equity targets. Applied to the State of Georgia, USA, DOVA-PATBM (i) increases 30 km tile coverage by 12 percentage points, (ii) halves the mean distance that low-income residents travel to the nearest charger, and (iii) meets sub-transmission headroom everywhere -- all while remaining computationally tractable for national-scale roll-outs. These results demonstrate that a tightly integrated, GNN-driven, multi-resolution approach can bridge the gap between academic optimisation and deployable infrastructure policy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized Layer Selection for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14964v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combine node attributes over a fixed granularity of the local graph structure around a node to predict its label. However, different nodes may relate to a node-level property with a different granularity of its local neighborhood, and using the same level of smoothing for all nodes can be detrimental to their classification. In this work, we challenge the common fact that a single GNN layer can classify all nodes of a graph by training GNNs with a distinct personalized layer for each node. Inspired by metric learning, we propose a novel algorithm, MetSelect1, to select the optimal representation layer to classify each node. In particular, we identify a prototype representation of each class in a transformed GNN layer and then, classify using the layer where the distance is smallest to a class prototype after normalizing with that layer's variance. Results on 10 datasets and 3 different GNNs show that we significantly improve the node classification accuracy of GNNs in a plug-and-play manner. We also find that using variable layers for prediction enables GNNs to be deeper and more robust to poisoning attacks. We hope this work can inspire future works to learn more adaptive and personalized graph representations.</p></details> |  |

While graph neural networks (GNNs) capture structured graph information and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in semantic comprehension, current approaches lack integration at the reasoning level. We propose HetGCoT, a framework enabling LLMs to effectively leverage and learn information from graphs to reason interpretable academic QA results. Our framework introduces three technical contributions: (1) a framework that transforms heterogeneous graph structural information into LLM-processable reasoning chains, (2) an adaptive metapath selection mechanism identifying relevant subgraphs for specific queries, and (3) a multi-step reasoning strategy systematically incorporating graph contexts into the reasoning process. Experiments on OpenAlex and DBLP datasets show our approach outperforms all sota baselines. The framework demonstrates adaptability across different LLM architectures and applicability to various scholarly question answering tasks.</p></details> |  |

Our graph neural networks that combine webgraph and social media contexts generate to state-of-the-art results in website credibility classification and significantly improves the top-k identification of unreliable domains. Additionally, we release a novel dataset of dredge words, highlighting their strong connections to both social media and online commerce platforms.</p></details> |  |

In this demo, we propose LLMNet, showing how to design GNN automated through Large Language Models. Our system develops a set of agents that construct graph-related knowlege bases and then leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to support automated configuration and refinement of GNN models through a knowledge-guided evolution process. These agents, equipped with specialized knowledge bases, extract insights into tasks and graph structures by interacting with the knowledge bases. Empirical results show LLMNet excels in twelve datasets across three graph learning tasks, validating its effectiveness of GNN model designing.</p></details> |  |

The Surprising Impact of Hybrid Graph Representations on Code Clone Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14470v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As one of the most detrimental code smells, code clones significantly increase software maintenance costs and heighten vulnerability risks, making their detection a critical challenge in software engineering. Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) dominate deep learning-based code clone detection due to their precise syntactic structure representation, but they inherently lack semantic depth. Recent studies address this by enriching AST-based representations with semantic graphs, such as Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) and Data Flow Graphs (DFGs). However, the effectiveness of various enriched AST-based representations and their compatibility with different graph-based machine learning techniques remains an open question, warranting further investigation to unlock their full potential in addressing the complexities of code clone detection. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of AST-based hybrid graph representations in Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based code clone detection. We systematically compare various hybrid representations ((CFG, DFG, Flow-Augmented ASTs (FA-AST)) across multiple GNN architectures. Our experiments reveal that hybrid representations impact GNNs differently: while AST+CFG+DFG consistently enhances accuracy for convolution- and attention-based models (Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT)), FA-AST frequently introduces structural complexity that harms performance. Notably, GMN outperforms others even with standard AST representations, highlighting its superior cross-code similarity detection and reducing the need for enriched structures.</p></details> |  |

Existing data-driven methods of detecting pain from facial expressions are limited due to interpretability and severity quantification. To this end, we propose GraphAU-Pain, leveraging a graph-based framework to model facial Action Units (AUs) and their interrelationships for pain intensity estimation. AUs are represented as graph nodes, with co-occurrence relationships as edges, enabling a more expressive depiction of pain-related facial behaviors. By utilizing a relational graph neural network, our framework offers improved interpretability and significant performance gains. Experiments conducted on the publicly available UNBC dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the GraphAU-Pain, achieving an F1-score of 66.21% and accuracy of 87.61% in pain intensity estimation.</p></details> | MiGA@IJCAI25 |
| **[Can Large Language Models Improve Spectral Graph Neural Networks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14220v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) have attracted significant attention due to their ability to approximate arbitrary filters. They typically rely on supervision from downstream tasks to adaptively learn appropriate filters. However, under label-scarce conditions, SGNNs may learn suboptimal filters, leading to degraded performance. Meanwhile, the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has inspired growing interest in exploring their potential within the GNN domain. This naturally raises an important question: \textit{Can LLMs help overcome the limitations of SGNNs and enhance their performance?} In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages LLMs to estimate the homophily of a given graph. The estimated homophily is then used to adaptively guide the design of polynomial spectral filters, thereby improving the expressiveness and adaptability of SGNNs across diverse graph structures. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight pipeline in which the LLM generates homophily-aware priors, which are injected into the filter coefficients to better align with the underlying graph topology. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our LLM-driven SGNN framework consistently outperforms existing baselines under both homophilic and heterophilic settings, with minimal computational and monetary overhead.</p></details> |  |

Existing studies on graph learning with label noise commonly rely on class-dependent label noise, overlooking the complexities of instance-dependent noise and falling short of capturing real-world corruption patterns. We introduce BeGIN (Benchmarking for Graphs with Instance-dependent Noise), a new benchmark that provides realistic graph datasets with various noise types and comprehensively evaluates noise-handling strategies across GNN architectures, noisy label detection, and noise-robust learning. To simulate instance-dependent corruptions, BeGIN introduces algorithmic methods and LLM-based simulations. Our experiments reveal the challenges of instance-dependent noise, particularly LLM-based corruption, and underscore the importance of node-specific parameterization to enhance GNN robustness. By comprehensively evaluating noise-handling strategies, BeGIN provides insights into their effectiveness, efficiency, and key performance factors. We expect that BeGIN will serve as a valuable resource for advancing research on label noise in graphs and fostering the development of robust GNN training methods.

However, exact computation is highly expensive, and real-world TBC distributions are extremely imbalanced. The severe imbalance leads learning-based models to overfit to zero-centrality nodes, resulting in inaccurate TBC predictions and failure to identify truly central nodes. Existing graph neural network (GNN) methods either fail to handle such imbalance or ignore temporal dependencies altogether. To address these issues, we propose a scalable and inductive contrastive learning-based GNN (CLGNN) for accurate and efficient TBC prediction. CLGNN builds an instance graph to preserve path validity and temporal order, then encodes structural and temporal features using dual aggregation, i.e., mean and edge-to-node multi-head attention mechanisms, enhanced by temporal path count and time encodings. A stability-based clustering-guided contrastive module (KContrastNet) is introduced to separate high-, median-, and low-centrality nodes in representation space, mitigating class imbalance, while a regression module (ValueNet) estimates TBC values. CLGNN also supports multiple optimal path definitions to accommodate diverse temporal semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CLGNN across diverse benchmarks. CLGNN achieves up to a 663.7~$\times$ speedup compared to state-of-the-art exact TBC computation methods. It outperforms leading static GNN baselines with up to 31.4~$\times$ lower MAE and 16.7~$\times$ higher Spearman correlation, and surpasses state-of-the-art temporal GNNs with up to 5.7~$\times$ lower MAE and 3.9~$\times$ higher Spearman correlation.</p></details> |  |

However, their best performance depends on choosing the right model architecture and the training objective, also called the loss function. Researchers have studied these parts separately, but a large-scale evaluation has not looked at how GNN models and many loss functions work together across different tasks. To fix this, we ran a thorough study - it included seven well-known GNN architectures. We also used a large group of 30 single plus mixed loss functions. The study looked at both inductive and transductive settings. Our evaluation spanned three distinct real-world datasets, assessing performance in both inductive and transductive settings using 21 comprehensive evaluation metrics. From these extensive results (detailed in supplementary information 1 \& 2), we meticulously analyzed the top ten model-loss combinations for each metric based on their average rank. Our findings reveal that, especially for the inductive case: 1) Hybrid loss functions generally yield superior and more robust performance compared to single loss functions, indicating the benefit of multi-objective optimization. 2) The GIN architecture always showed the highest-level average performance, especially with Cross-Entropy loss. 3) Although some combinations had overall lower average ranks, models such as GAT, particularly with certain hybrid losses, demonstrated incredible specialized strengths, maximizing the most top-1 results among the individual metrics, emphasizing subtle strengths for particular task demands. 4) On the other hand, the MPNN architecture typically lagged behind the scenarios it was tested against.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM s...</summary><p>ACM single column 633 pages</p></details> |

In this work, we employ GemNet-T, a graph neural network model, as an MLFF and investigate two training strategies: (1) direct training on MD17 (10K samples) without pre-training, and (2) pre-training on the large-scale OC20 dataset followed by fine-tuning on MD17 (10K). While both approaches achieve low force mean absolute errors (MAEs), reaching 5 meV/A per atom, we find that lower force errors do not necessarily guarantee stable MD simulations. Notably, the pre-trained GemNet-T model yields significantly improved simulation stability, sustaining trajectories up to three times longer than the model trained from scratch. These findings underscore the value of pre-training on large, diverse datasets to capture complex molecular interactions and highlight that force MAE alone is not always a sufficient metric of MD simulation stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Density-aware Walks for Coordinated Campaign Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13912v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinated campaigns frequently exploit social media platforms by artificially amplifying topics, making inauthentic trends appear organic, and misleading users into engagement. Distinguishing these coordinated efforts from genuine public discourse remains a significant challenge due to the sophisticated nature of such attacks. Our work focuses on detecting coordinated campaigns by modeling the problem as a graph classification task. We leverage the recently introduced Large Engagement Networks (LEN) dataset, which contains over 300 networks capturing engagement patterns from both fake and authentic trends on Twitter prior to the 2023 Turkish elections. The graphs in LEN were constructed by collecting interactions related to campaigns that stemmed from ephemeral astroturfing. Established graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle to accurately classify campaign graphs, highlighting the challenges posed by LEN due to the large size of its networks. To address this, we introduce a new graph classification method that leverages the density of local network structures. We propose a random weighted walk (RWW) approach in which node transitions are biased by local density measures such as degree, core number, or truss number. These RWWs are encoded using the Skip-gram model, producing density-aware structural embeddings for the nodes. Training message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) on these density-aware embeddings yields superior results compared to the simpler node features available in the dataset, with nearly a 12\% and 5\% improvement in accuracy for binary and multiclass classification, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating density-aware structural encoding with MPNNs provides a robust framework for identifying coordinated inauthentic behavior on social media networks such as Twitter.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 Pa...</summary><p>16 Pages.

We provide a logical characterization of HEGNN node classifiers, with and without subgraph restrictions, using graded hybrid logic. This characterization enables us to relate the separating power of HEGNNs to that of higher-order GNNs, GNNs enriched with local homomorphism count features, and color refinement algorithms based on Individualization-Refinement.

GITO consists of two main modules: a hybrid graph transformer (HGT) and a transformer neural operator (TNO). HGT leverages a graph neural network (GNN) to encode local spatial relationships and a transformer to capture long-range dependencies. A self-attention fusion layer integrates the outputs of the GNN and transformer to enable more expressive feature learning on graph-structured data. TNO module employs linear-complexity cross-attention and self-attention layers to map encoded input functions to predictions at arbitrary query locations, ensuring discretization invariance and enabling zero-shot super-resolution across any mesh. Empirical results on benchmark PDE tasks demonstrate that GITO outperforms existing transformer-based neural operators, paving the way for efficient, mesh-agnostic surrogate solvers in engineering applications.</p></details> |  |

TwiUSD enables rigorous evaluation of stance models by integrating tweet content and social links, with superior scale and annotation quality. Building on this resource, we propose MRFG: a structure-aware framework that uses LLM-based relevance filtering and feature routing to address noise and context heterogeneity. MRFG employs multi-scale filtering and adaptively routes features through graph neural networks or multi-layer perceptrons based on topological informativeness. Experiments show MRFG consistently outperforms strong baselines (including PLMs, graph-based models, and LLM prompting) in both in-target and cross-target evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Navigating the Black Box: Leveraging LLMs for Effective Text-Level Graph Injection Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13276v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) integrate textual data with graph structures, providing valuable insights in applications such as social network analysis and recommendation systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively capture both topological structure and textual information in TAGs but are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing graph injection attack (GIA) methods assume that attackers can directly manipulate the embedding layer, producing non-explainable node embeddings. Furthermore, the effectiveness of these attacks often relies on surrogate models with high training costs. Thus, this paper introduces ATAG-LLM, a novel black-box GIA framework tailored for TAGs. Our approach leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate interpretable text-level node attributes directly, ensuring attacks remain feasible in real-world scenarios. We design strategies for LLM prompting that balance exploration and reliability to guide text generation, and propose a similarity assessment method to evaluate attack text effectiveness in disrupting graph homophily. This method efficiently perturbs the target node with minimal training costs in a strict black-box setting, ensuring a text-level graph injection attack for TAGs. Experiments on real-world TAG datasets validate the superior performance of ATAG-LLM compared to state-of-the-art embedding-level and text-level attack methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks and Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Resource Allocation for V2X Communications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06518v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology, Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) communication has attracted much attention due to its superior performance in coverage, latency, and throughput. Resource allocation within C-V2X is crucial for ensuring the transmission of safety information and meeting the stringent requirements for ultra-low latency and high reliability in Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication. This paper proposes a method that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to address this challenge. By constructing a dynamic graph with communication links as nodes and employing the Graph Sample and Aggregation (GraphSAGE) model to adapt to changes in graph structure, the model aims to ensure a high success rate for V2V communication while minimizing interference on Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) links, thereby ensuring the successful transmission of V2V link information and maintaining high transmission rates for V2I links. The proposed method retains the global feature learning capabilities of GNN and supports distributed network deployment, allowing vehicles to extract low-dimensional features that include structural information from the graph network based on local observations and to make independent resource allocation decisions. Simulation results indicate that the introduction of GNN, with a modest increase in computational load, effectively enhances the decision-making quality of agents, demonstrating superiority to other methods. This study not only provides a theoretically efficient resource allocation strategy for V2V and V2I communications but also paves a new technical path for resource management in practical IoV environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 11 figures.

| **[On the Completeness of Invariant Geometric Deep Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04836v4)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Invariant models, one important class of geometric deep learning models, are capable of generating meaningful geometric representations by leveraging informative geometric features in point clouds. These models are characterized by their simplicity, good experimental results and computational efficiency. However, their theoretical expressive power still remains unclear, restricting a deeper understanding of the potential of such models. In this work, we concentrate on characterizing the theoretical expressiveness of a wide range of invariant models under fully-connected conditions. We first rigorously characterize the expressiveness of the most classic invariant model, message-passing neural networks incorporating distance (DisGNN), restricting its unidentifiable cases to be only highly symmetric point clouds. We then prove that GeoNGNN, the geometric counterpart of one of the simplest subgraph graph neural networks, can effectively break these corner cases' symmetry and thus achieve E(3)-completeness. By leveraging GeoNGNN as a theoretical tool, we further prove that: 1) most subgraph GNNs developed in traditional graph learning can be seamlessly extended to geometric scenarios with E(3)-completeness; 2) DimeNet, GemNet and SphereNet, three well-established invariant models, are also all capable of achieving E(3)-completeness. Our theoretical results fill the gap in the expressive power of invariant models, contributing to a rigorous and comprehensive understanding of their capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>The T...</summary><p>The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations</p></details> |

We propose a novel graph-based approach for predicting causative genes from patient phenotypes, with or without an available list of candidate genes, by integrating a rare disease knowledge graph (KG). Our model, combining graph neural networks and transformers, achieves substantial improvements over the current state-of-the-art. On the real-world MyGene2 dataset, it attains a mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of 24.64\% and nDCG@100 of 33.64\%, surpassing the best baseline (SHEPHERD) at 19.02\% MRR and 30.54\% nDCG@100. We perform extensive ablation studies to validate the contribution of each model component. Notably, the approach generalizes to cases where only phenotypic data are available, addressing key challenges in clinical decision support when genomic information is incomplete.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Graph Condensation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13099v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research on deep graph learning has shifted from static to dynamic graphs, motivated by the evolving behaviors observed in complex real-world systems. However, the temporal extension in dynamic graphs poses significant data efficiency challenges, including increased data volume, high spatiotemporal redundancy, and reliance on costly dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs). To alleviate the concerns, we pioneer the study of dynamic graph condensation (DGC), which aims to substantially reduce the scale of dynamic graphs for data-efficient DGNN training. Accordingly, we propose DyGC, a novel framework that condenses the real dynamic graph into a compact version while faithfully preserving the inherent spatiotemporal characteristics. Specifically, to endow synthetic graphs with realistic evolving structures, a novel spiking structure generation mechanism is introduced. It draws on the dynamic behavior of spiking neurons to model temporally-aware connectivity in dynamic graphs. Given the tightly coupled spatiotemporal dependencies, DyGC proposes a tailored distribution matching approach that first constructs a semantically rich state evolving field for dynamic graphs, and then performs fine-grained spatiotemporal state alignment to guide the optimization of the condensed graph. Experiments across multiple dynamic graph datasets and representative DGNN architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of DyGC. Notably, our method retains up to 96.2% DGNN performance with only 0.5% of the original graph size, and achieves up to 1846 times training speedup.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Graph Neural Networks: A Multi-Hop Evidence Fusion Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13083v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel in graph representation learning by integrating graph structure and node features. Existing GNNs, unfortunately, fail to account for the uncertainty of class probabilities that vary with the depth of the model, leading to unreliable and risky predictions in real-world scenarios. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose a novel Evidence Fusing Graph Neural Network (EFGNN for short) to achieve trustworthy prediction, enhance node classification accuracy, and make explicit the risk of wrong predictions. In particular, we integrate the evidence theory with multi-hop propagation-based GNN architecture to quantify the prediction uncertainty of each node with the consideration of multiple receptive fields. Moreover, a parameter-free cumulative belief fusion (CBF) mechanism is developed to leverage the changes in prediction uncertainty and fuse the evidence to improve the trustworthiness of the final prediction. To effectively optimize the EFGNN model, we carefully design a joint learning objective composed of evidence cross-entropy, dissonance coefficient, and false confident penalty. The experimental results on various datasets and theoretical analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of accuracy and trustworthiness, as well as its robustness to potential attacks. The source code of EFGNN is available at https://github.com/Shiy-Li/EFGNN.</p></details> | Accepted by TNNLS |
| **[Boosting Column Generation with Graph Neural Networks for Joint Rider Trip Planning and Crew Shift Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03692v5)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing service schedules is pivotal to the reliable, efficient, and inclusive on-demand mobility. This pressing challenge is further exacerbated by the increasing needs of an aging population, the oversubscription of existing services, and the lack of effective solution methods. This study addresses the intricacies of service scheduling, by jointly optimizing rider trip planning and crew scheduling for a complex dynamic mobility service. The resulting optimization problems are extremely challenging computationally for state-of-the-art methods. To address this fundamental gap, this paper introduces the Joint Rider Trip Planning and Crew Shift Scheduling Problem (JRTPCSSP) and a novel solution method, called Attention and Gated GNN-Informed Column Generation (AGGNNI-CG), that hybridizes column generation and machine learning to obtain near-optimal solutions to the JRTPCSSP with real-life constraints of the application. The key idea of the machine-learning component is to dramatically reduce the number of paths to explore in the pricing problem, accelerating the most time-consuming component of the column generation. The machine learning component is a graph neural network with an attention mechanism and a gated architecture, which is particularly suited to cater for the different input sizes coming from daily operations. AGGNNI-CG has been applied to a challenging, real-world dataset from the Paratransit system of Chatham County in Georgia. It produces substantial improvements compared to the baseline column generation approach, which typically cannot produce high-quality feasible solutions in reasonable time on large-scale complex instances. AGGNNI-CG also produces significant improvements in service quality compared to the existing system.</p></details> |  |

However, current analysis methods often struggle with noisy data, limited scalability, and inadequate modelling of complex cellular relationships. We present SemanticST, a biologically informed, graph-based deep learning framework that models diverse cellular contexts through multi-semantic graph construction. SemanticST builds multiple context-specific graphs capturing spatial proximity, gene expression similarity, and tissue domain structure, and learns disentangled embeddings for each. These are fused using an attention-inspired strategy to yield a unified, biologically meaningful representation. A community-aware min-cut loss improves robustness over contrastive learning, particularly in sparse ST data. SemanticST supports mini-batch training, making it the first graph neural network scalable to large-scale datasets such as Xenium (500,000 cells). Benchmarking across four platforms (Visium, Slide-seq, Stereo-seq, Xenium) and multiple human and mouse tissues shows consistent 20 percentage gains in ARI, NMI, and trajectory fidelity over DeepST, GraphST, and IRIS. In re-analysis of breast cancer Xenium data, SemanticST revealed rare and clinically significant niches, including triple receptor-positive clusters, spatially distinct DCIS-to-IDC transition zones, and FOXC2 tumour-associated myoepithelial cells, suggesting non-canonical EMT programs with stem-like features. SemanticST thus provides a scalable, interpretable, and biologically grounded framework for spatial transcriptomics analysis, enabling robust discovery across tissue types and diseases, and paving the way for spatially resolved tissue atlases and next-generation precision medicine.</p></details> | 6 Figures |

While traditional numerical methods have proven robust, they require extensive computation to maintain physical fidelity under dynamic or contingency conditions. In contrast, recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly improved computational speed; however, they often fail to enforce fundamental physical laws during real-world contingencies, resulting in physically implausible predictions. In this work, we introduce KCLNet, a physics-informed graph neural network that incorporates Kirchhoff's Current Law as a hard constraint via hyperplane projections. KCLNet attains competitive prediction accuracy while ensuring zero KCL violations, thereby delivering reliable and physically consistent power flow predictions critical to secure the operation of modern smart grids.</p></details> |  |

Designing such systems involves integrating heterogeneous signals across domains, capturing temporal dynamics, and optimizing for multiple, often competing, objectives. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) provide a powerful framework for modeling complex interactions in such environments. In this paper, we present a cross-domain GNN-based system deployed at LinkedIn that unifies user, content, and activity signals into a single, large-scale graph. By training on this cross-domain structure, our model significantly outperforms single-domain baselines on key tasks, including click-through rate (CTR) prediction and professional engagement. We introduce architectural innovations including temporal modeling and multi-task learning, which further enhance performance. Deployed in LinkedIn's notification system, our approach led to a 0.10% lift in weekly active users and a 0.62% improvement in CTR. We detail our graph construction process, model design, training pipeline, and both offline and online evaluations. Our work demonstrates the scalability and effectiveness of cross-domain GNNs in real-world, high-impact applications.</p></details> |  |

However, current OSL methods often suffer from ambiguities, particularly when robots misattribute odours to incorrect objects due to limitations in olfactory datasets and sensor resolutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning method using diffusion-based molecular generation to enhance odour localization accuracy that can be used by itself or with automated olfactory dataset construction pipelines with vision-language models (VLMs) This generative process of our diffusion model expands the chemical space beyond the limitations of both current olfactory datasets and the training data of VLMs, enabling the identification of potential odourant molecules not previously documented. The generated molecules can then be more accurately validated using advanced olfactory sensors which emulate human olfactory recognition through electronic sensor arrays. By integrating visual analysis, language processing, and molecular generation, our framework enhances the ability of olfaction-vision models on robots to accurately associate odours with their correct sources, thereby improving navigation and decision-making through better sensor selection for a target compound. Our methodology represents a foundational advancement in the field of artificial olfaction, offering a scalable solution to the challenges posed by limited olfactory data and sensor ambiguities.</p></details> |  |

However, interpreting GNN predictions remains a challenging open problem. While many GNN explainability methods have been proposed for node or graph-level tasks, approaches for generating explanations for link predictions in heterogeneous settings are limited. In this paper, we propose RAW-Explainer, a novel framework designed to generate connected, concise, and thus interpretable subgraph explanations for link prediction. Our method leverages the heterogeneous information in knowledge graphs to identify connected subgraphs that serve as patterns of factual explanation via a random walk objective. Unlike existing methods tailored to knowledge graphs, our approach employs a neural network to parameterize the explanation generation process, which significantly speeds up the production of collective explanations. Furthermore, RAW-Explainer is designed to overcome the distribution shift issue when evaluating the quality of an explanatory subgraph which is orders of magnitude smaller than the full graph, by proposing a robust evaluator that generalizes to the subgraph distribution. Extensive quantitative results on real-world knowledge graph datasets demonstrate that our approach strikes a balance between explanation quality and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Although Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms have shown potential in optimizing TSC through real-time decision-making, their scalability and effectiveness often suffer from large-scale and complex environments. Typically, these limitations primarily stem from a fundamental mismatch between the exponential growth of the state space driven by the environmental heterogeneities and the limited modeling capacity of current solutions. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel MARL framework that integrates Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs) and Topological Data Analysis (TDA), aiming to enhance the expressiveness of environmental representations and improve agent coordination. Furthermore, inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture in Large Language Models (LLMs), a topology-assisted spatial pattern disentangling (TSD)-enhanced MoE is proposed, which leverages topological signatures to decouple graph features for specialized processing, thus improving the model's ability to characterize dynamic and heterogeneous local observations. The TSD module is also integrated into the policy and value networks of the Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm, further improving decision-making efficiency and robustness. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world traffic scenarios, together with comprehensive theoretical analysis, validate the superior performance of the proposed framework, highlighting the model's scalability and effectiveness in addressing the complexities of large-scale TSC tasks.</p></details> |  |

Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a viable machine learning approach for training a shared model on decentralized data, addressing privacy concerns while leveraging parallelism. Existing methods that address the unique requirements of federated GNN training using remote embeddings to enhance convergence accuracy are limited by their diminished performance due to large communication costs with a shared embedding server. In this paper, we present OpES, an optimized federated GNN training framework that uses remote neighbourhood pruning, and overlaps pushing of embeddings to the server with local training to reduce the network costs and training time. The modest drop in per-round accuracy due to pre-emptive push of embeddings is out-stripped by the reduction in per-round training time for large and dense graphs like Reddit and Products, converging up to $\approx2\times$ faster than the state-of-the-art technique using an embedding server and giving up to $20\%$ better accuracy than vanilla federated GNN learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of paper in the proceedings of the 30th International European Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing (Euro-Par)</p></details> |
| **[CORONA: A Coarse-to-Fine Framework for Graph-based Recommendation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17281v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems (RSs) are designed to retrieve candidate items a user might be interested in from a large pool. A common approach is using graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture high-order interaction relationships. As large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities across domains, researchers are exploring their use to enhance recommendation. However, prior work limits LLMs to re-ranking results or dataset augmentation, failing to utilize their power during candidate filtering - which may lead to suboptimal performance. Instead, we propose to leverage LLMs' reasoning abilities during the candidate filtering process, and introduce Chain Of Retrieval ON grAphs (CORONA) to progressively narrow down the range of candidate items on interaction graphs with the help of LLMs: (1) First, LLM performs preference reasoning based on user profiles, with the response serving as a query to extract relevant users and items from the interaction graph as preference-assisted retrieval; (2) Then, using the information retrieved in the previous step along with the purchase history of target user, LLM conducts intent reasoning to help refine an even smaller interaction subgraph as intent-assisted retrieval; (3) Finally, we employ a GNN to capture high-order collaborative filtering information from the extracted subgraph, performing GNN-enhanced retrieval to generate the final recommendation results. The proposed framework leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs during the retrieval process, while seamlessly integrating GNNs to enhance overall recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on various datasets and settings demonstrate that our proposed CORONA achieves state-of-the-art performance with an 18.6% relative improvement in recall and an 18.4% relative improvement in NDCG on average.</p></details> |  |
| **[GSDNet: Revisiting Incomplete Multimodal-Diffusion from Graph Spectrum Perspective for Conversation Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12325v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal emotion recognition in conversations (MERC) aims to infer the speaker's emotional state by analyzing utterance information from multiple sources (i.e., video, audio, and text). Compared with unimodality, a more robust utterance representation can be obtained by fusing complementary semantic information from different modalities. However, the modality missing problem severely limits the performance of MERC in practical scenarios. Recent work has achieved impressive performance on modality completion using graph neural networks and diffusion models, respectively. This inspires us to combine these two dimensions through the graph diffusion model to obtain more powerful modal recovery capabilities. Unfortunately, existing graph diffusion models may destroy the connectivity and local structure of the graph by directly adding Gaussian noise to the adjacency matrix, resulting in the generated graph data being unable to retain the semantic and topological information of the original graph. To this end, we propose a novel Graph Spectral Diffusion Network (GSDNet), which maps Gaussian noise to the graph spectral space of missing modalities and recovers the missing data according to its original distribution. Compared with previous graph diffusion methods, GSDNet only affects the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix instead of destroying the adjacency matrix directly, which can maintain the global topological information and important spectral features during the diffusion process. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GSDNet achieves state-of-the-art emotion recognition performance in various modality loss scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Directed Acyclic Graph Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12218v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are central to science and engineering applications including causal inference, scheduling, and neural architecture search. In this work, we introduce the DAG Convolutional Network (DCN), a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture designed specifically for convolutional learning from signals supported on DAGs. The DCN leverages causal graph filters to learn nodal representations that account for the partial ordering inherent to DAGs, a strong inductive bias does not present in conventional GNNs. Unlike prior art in machine learning over DAGs, DCN builds on formal convolutional operations that admit spectral-domain representations. We further propose the Parallel DCN (PDCN), a model that feeds input DAG signals to a parallel bank of causal graph-shift operators and processes these DAG-aware features using a shared multilayer perceptron. This way, PDCN decouples model complexity from graph size while maintaining satisfactory predictive performance. The architectures' permutation equivariance and expressive power properties are also established. Comprehensive numerical tests across several tasks, datasets, and experimental conditions demonstrate that (P)DCN compares favorably with state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. These results position (P)DCN as a viable framework for deep learning from DAG-structured data that is designed from first (graph) signal processing principles.</p></details> |  |

The resulting patterns are often neglected by temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs). To formally analyze the expressive power of TGNNs, we lack a generalization of graph isomorphism to temporal graphs that fully captures their causal topology. Addressing this gap, we introduce the notion of consistent event graph isomorphism, which utilizes a time-unfolded representation of time-respecting paths in temporal graphs. We compare this definition with existing notions of temporal graph isomorphisms. We illustrate and highlight the advantages of our approach and develop a temporal generalization of the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm to heuristically distinguish non-isomorphic temporal graphs. Building on this theoretical foundation, we derive a novel message passing scheme for temporal graph neural networks that operates on the event graph representation of temporal graphs. An experimental evaluation shows that our approach performs well in a temporal graph classification experiment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Semi-Supervised Learning for Point Classification on Data Manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12197v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a graph semi-supervised learning framework for classification tasks on data manifolds. Motivated by the manifold hypothesis, we model data as points sampled from a low-dimensional manifold $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^F$. The manifold is approximated in an unsupervised manner using a variational autoencoder (VAE), where the trained encoder maps data to embeddings that represent their coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^F$. A geometric graph is constructed with Gaussian-weighted edges inversely proportional to distances in the embedding space, transforming the point classification problem into a semi-supervised node classification task on the graph. This task is solved using a graph neural network (GNN). Our main contribution is a theoretical analysis of the statistical generalization properties of this data-to-manifold-to-graph pipeline. We show that, under uniform sampling from $\mathcal{M}$, the generalization gap of the semi-supervised task diminishes with increasing graph size, up to the GNN training error. Leveraging a training procedure which resamples a slightly larger graph at regular intervals during training, we then show that the generalization gap can be reduced even further, vanishing asymptotically. Finally, we validate our findings with numerical experiments on image classification benchmarks, demonstrating the empirical effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 26 pages |

Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The question is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally, to assess performance beyond prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks in terms of their computational complexity and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taxonomy of reduction matrices for Graph Coarsening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11743v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph coarsening aims to diminish the size of a graph to lighten its memory footprint, and has numerous applications in graph signal processing and machine learning. It is usually defined using a reduction matrix and a lifting matrix, which, respectively, allows to project a graph signal from the original graph to the coarsened one and back. This results in a loss of information measured by the so-called Restricted Spectral Approximation (RSA). Most coarsening frameworks impose a fixed relationship between the reduction and lifting matrices, generally as pseudo-inverses of each other, and seek to define a coarsening that minimizes the RSA. In this paper, we remark that the roles of these two matrices are not entirely symmetric: indeed, putting constraints on the lifting matrix alone ensures the existence of important objects such as the coarsened graph's adjacency matrix or Laplacian. In light of this, in this paper, we introduce a more general notion of reduction matrix, that is not necessarily the pseudo-inverse of the lifting matrix. We establish a taxonomy of ``admissible'' families of reduction matrices, discuss the different properties that they must satisfy and whether they admit a closed-form description or not. We show that, for a fixed coarsening represented by a fixed lifting matrix, the RSA can be further reduced simply by modifying the reduction matrix. We explore different examples, including some based on a constrained optimization process of the RSA. Since this criterion has also been linked to the performance of Graph Neural Networks, we also illustrate the impact of this choices on different node classification tasks on coarsened graphs.</p></details> |  |

R-GNNs were theoretically motivated by the well known connection between the expressive power of GNNs and $C_2$, first-order logic with two variables and counting. In the context of planning, $C_2$ features refer to the set of formulae in $C_2$ with relations defined by the unary and binary predicates of a planning domain. Some planning domains exhibit optimal value functions that can be decomposed as arithmetic expressions of $C_2$ features. We show that, contrary to empirical results, R-GNNs cannot learn value functions defined by $C_2$ features. We also identify prior GNN architectures for planning that may better learn value functions defined by $C_2$ features.</p></details> |  |

A key challenge in the system is overloading, which leads to an unstable system status and consumes additional system resources. In this paper, we use a graph neural network-based deep reinforcement learning to collaboratively control the data emission rate at which the data is generated in the stream source to proactively avoid overloading scenarios. Instead of using a traditional multi-layer perceptron-styled network to control the rate, the graph neural network is used to process system metrics collected from the stream processing engine. Consequently, the learning agent (i) avoids storing past states where previous actions may affect the current state, (ii) is without waiting a long interval until the current action has been fully effective and reflected in the system's specific metrics, and more importantly, (iii) is able to adapt multiple stream applications in multiple scenarios. We deploy the rate control approach on three applications, and the experimental results demonstrate that the throughput and end-to-end latency are improved by up to 13.5% and 30%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometry-Aware Edge Pooling for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11700v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown significant success for graph-based tasks. Motivated by the prevalence of large datasets in real-world applications, pooling layers are crucial components of GNNs. By reducing the size of input graphs, pooling enables faster training and potentially better generalisation. However, existing pooling operations often optimise for the learning task at the expense of fundamental graph structures and interpretability. This leads to unreliable performance across varying dataset types, downstream tasks and pooling ratios. Addressing these concerns, we propose novel graph pooling layers for structure aware pooling via edge collapses. Our methods leverage diffusion geometry and iteratively reduce a graph's size while preserving both its metric structure and structural diversity. We guide pooling using magnitude, an isometry-invariant diversity measure, which permits us to control the fidelity of the pooling process. Further, we use the spread of a metric space as a faster and more stable alternative ensuring computational efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our methods (i) achieve superior performance compared to alternative pooling layers across a range of diverse graph classification tasks, (ii) preserve key spectral properties of the input graphs, and (iii) retain high accuracy across varying pooling ratios.</p></details> |  |
| **[FIGNN: Feature-Specific Interpretability for Graph Neural Network Surrogate Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11398v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture, the Feature-specific Interpretable Graph Neural Network (FIGNN), designed to enhance the interpretability of deep learning surrogate models defined on unstructured grids in scientific applications. Traditional GNNs often obscure the distinct spatial influences of different features in multivariate prediction tasks. FIGNN addresses this limitation by introducing a feature-specific pooling strategy, which enables independent attribution of spatial importance for each predicted variable. Additionally, a mask-based regularization term is incorporated into the training objective to explicitly encourage alignment between interpretability and predictive error, promoting localized attribution of model performance. The method is evaluated for surrogate modeling of two physically distinct systems: the SPEEDY atmospheric circulation model and the backward-facing step (BFS) fluid dynamics benchmark. Results demonstrate that FIGNN achieves competitive predictive performance while revealing physically meaningful spatial patterns unique to each feature. Analysis of rollout stability, feature-wise error budgets, and spatial mask overlays confirm the utility of FIGNN as a general-purpose framework for interpretable surrogate modeling in complex physical domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[EDN: A Novel Edge-Dependent Noise Model for Graph Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11368v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An important structural feature of a graph is its set of edges, as it captures the relationships among the nodes (the graph's topology). Existing node label noise models like Symmetric Label Noise (SLN) and Class Conditional Noise (CCN) disregard this important node relationship in graph data; and the Edge-Dependent Noise (EDN) model addresses this limitation. EDN posits that in real-world scenarios, label noise may be influenced by the connections between nodes. We explore three variants of EDN. A crucial notion that relates nodes and edges in a graph is the degree of a node; we show that in all three variants, the probability of a node's label corruption is dependent on its degree. Additionally, we compare the dependence of these probabilities on node degree across different variants. We performed experiments on popular graph datasets using 5 different GNN architectures and 8 noise robust algorithms for graph data. The results demonstrate that 2 variants of EDN lead to greater performance degradation in both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and existing noise-robust algorithms, as compared to traditional node label noise models. We statistically verify this by posing a suitable hypothesis-testing problem. This emphasizes the importance of incorporating EDN when evaluating noise robust algorithms for graphs, to enhance the reliability of graph-based learning in noisy environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Three iterations of $(d-1)$-WL test distinguish non isometric clouds of $d$-dimensional points](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12853v4)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Weisfeiler--Lehman (WL) test is a fundamental iterative algorithm for checking isomorphism of graphs. It has also been observed that it underlies the design of several graph neural network architectures, whose capabilities and performance can be understood in terms of the expressive power of this test. Motivated by recent developments in machine learning applications to datasets involving three-dimensional objects, we study when the WL test is {\em complete} for clouds of euclidean points represented by complete distance graphs, i.e., when it can distinguish, up to isometry, any arbitrary such cloud. %arbitrary clouds of euclidean points represented by complete distance graphs. % How many dimensions of the Weisfeiler--Lehman test is enough to distinguish any two non-isometric point clouds in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, assuming that these point clouds are given as complete graphs labeled by distances between the points? This question is important for understanding, which architectures of graph neural networks are capable of fully exploiting the spacial structure of a point cloud. Our main result states that the $(d-1)$-dimensional WL test is complete for point clouds in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, for any $d\ge 2$, and that only three iterations of the test suffice. We also observe that the $d$-dimensional WL test only requires one iteration to achieve completeness. Our paper thus provides complete understanding of the 3-dimensional case: it was shown in previous works that 1-WL is not complete in $\mathbb{R}^3$, and we show that 2-WL is complete there. We also strengthen the lower bound for 1-WL by showing that it is unable to recognize planar point clouds in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Finally, we show that 2-WL is not complete in $\mathbb{R}^6$, leaving as an open question, whether it is complete in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ for $d = 4,5$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Chang...</summary><p>Changes to previous version: new results, inability of 1-WL to recognize planar point clouds in R^3, and incompleteness of 2-WL in R^6</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Matrix Completion with Denoising and Augmented Graph Views for Robust Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10658v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matrix completion is a widely adopted framework in recommender systems, as predicting the missing entries in the user-item rating matrix enables a comprehensive understanding of user preferences. However, current graph neural network (GNN)-based approaches are highly sensitive to noisy or irrelevant edges--due to their inherent message-passing mechanisms--and are prone to overfitting, which limits their generalizability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel method called Matrix Completion using Contrastive Learning (MCCL). Our approach begins by extracting local neighborhood subgraphs for each interaction and subsequently generates two distinct graph representations. The first representation emphasizes denoising by integrating GNN layers with an attention mechanism, while the second is obtained via a graph variational autoencoder that aligns the feature distribution with a standard prior. A mutual learning loss function is employed during training to gradually harmonize these representations, enabling the model to capture common patterns and significantly enhance its generalizability. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only improves the numerical accuracy of the predicted scores--achieving up to a 0.8% improvement in RMSE--but also produces superior rankings with improvements of up to 36% in ranking metrics.</p></details> | 30 pages |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for Automatic Addition of Optimizing Components in Printed Circuit Board Schematics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10577v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The design and optimization of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) schematics is crucial for the development of high-quality electronic devices. Thereby, an important task is to optimize drafts by adding components that improve the robustness and reliability of the circuit, e.g., pull-up resistors or decoupling capacitors. Since there is a shortage of skilled engineers and manual optimizations are very time-consuming, these best practices are often neglected. However, this typically leads to higher costs for troubleshooting in later development stages as well as shortened product life cycles, resulting in an increased amount of electronic waste that is difficult to recycle. Here, we present an approach for automating the addition of new components into PCB schematics by representing them as bipartite graphs and utilizing a node pair prediction model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We apply our approach to three highly relevant PCB design optimization tasks and compare the performance of several popular GNN architectures on real-world datasets labeled by human experts. We show that GNNs can solve these problems with high accuracy and demonstrate that our approach offers the potential to automate PCB design optimizations in a time- and cost-efficient manner.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Features to Graphs: Exploring Graph Structures and Pairwise Interactions via GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13471v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature interaction is crucial in predictive machine learning models, as it captures the relationships between features that influence model performance. In this work, we focus on pairwise interactions and investigate their importance in constructing feature graphs for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We leverage existing GNN models and tools to explore the relationship between feature graph structures and their effectiveness in modeling interactions. Through experiments on synthesized datasets, we uncover that edges between interacting features are important for enabling GNNs to model feature interactions effectively. We also observe that including non-interaction edges can act as noise, degrading model performance. Furthermore, we provide theoretical support for sparse feature graph selection using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. We prove that feature graphs retaining only necessary interaction edges yield a more efficient and interpretable representation than complete graphs, aligning with Occam's Razor. Our findings offer both theoretical insights and practical guidelines for designing feature graphs that improve the performance and interpretability of GNN models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Integrating external knowledge resources, particularly knowledge graphs (KGs), provides a transparent and updatable foundation for more reliable reasoning. Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), which queries and reasons over KGs, is central to this effort, especially for complex, multi-hop queries. However, multi-hop reasoning poses two key challenges: (1)~maintaining coherent reasoning paths, and (2)~avoiding prematurely discarding critical multi-hop connections. To address these issues, we introduce iQUEST, a question-guided KBQA framework that iteratively decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, ensuring a structured and focused reasoning trajectory. Additionally, we integrate a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look ahead and incorporate 2-hop neighbor information at each reasoning step. This dual approach strengthens the reasoning process, enabling the model to explore viable paths more effectively. Detailed experiments demonstrate the consistent improvement delivered by iQUEST across four benchmark datasets and four LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 63rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2025), Main Track</p></details> |
| **[LightKG: Efficient Knowledge-Aware Recommendations with Simplified GNN Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10347v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the dominant approach for Knowledge Graph-aware Recommender Systems (KGRSs) due to their proven effectiveness. Building upon GNN-based KGRSs, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has been incorporated to address the sparity issue, leading to longer training time. However, through extensive experiments, we reveal that: (1)compared to other KGRSs, the existing GNN-based KGRSs fail to keep their superior performance under sparse interactions even with SSL. (2) More complex models tend to perform worse in sparse interaction scenarios and complex mechanisms, like attention mechanism, can be detrimental as they often increase learning difficulty. Inspired by these findings, we propose LightKG, a simple yet powerful GNN-based KGRS to address sparsity issues. LightKG includes a simplified GNN layer that encodes directed relations as scalar pairs rather than dense embeddings and employs a linear aggregation framework, greatly reducing the complexity of GNNs. Additionally, LightKG incorporates an efficient contrastive layer to implement SSL. It directly minimizes the node similarity in original graph, avoiding the time-consuming subgraph generation and comparison required in previous SSL methods. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show that LightKG outperforms 12 competitive KGRSs in both sparse and dense scenarios while significantly reducing training time. Specifically, it surpasses the best baselines by an average of 5.8\% in recommendation accuracy and saves 84.3\% of training time compared to KGRSs with SSL.

| **[Context-Adaptive Graph Neural Networks for Next POI Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10329v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a critical task in location-based services, aiming to predict users' next visits based on their check-in histories. While many existing methods leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to incorporate collaborative information and improve recommendation accuracy, most of them model each type of context using separate graphs, treating different factors in isolation. This limits their ability to model the co-influence of multiple contextual factors on user transitions during message propagation, resulting in suboptimal attention weights and recommendation performance. Furthermore, they often prioritize sequential components as the primary predictor, potentially undermining the semantic and structural information encoded in the POI embeddings learned by GNNs. To address these limitations, we propose a Context-Adaptive Graph Neural Networks (CAGNN) for next POI recommendation, which dynamically adjusts attention weights using edge-specific contextual factors and enables mutual enhancement between graph-based and sequential components. Specifically, CAGNN introduces (1) a context-adaptive attention mechanism that jointly incorporates different types of contextual factors into the attention computation during graph propagation, enabling the model to dynamically capture collaborative and context-dependent transition patterns; (2) a graph-sequential mutual enhancement module, which aligns the outputs of the graph- and sequential-based modules via the KL divergence, enabling mutual enhancement of both components. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that CAGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Meanwhile, theoretical guarantees are provided that our context-adaptive attention mechanism improves the expressiveness of POI representations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Graph-MLLM: Harnessing Multimodal Large Language Models for Multimodal Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10282v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in representing and understanding diverse modalities. However, they typically focus on modality alignment in a pairwise manner while overlooking structural relationships across data points. Integrating multimodality with structured graph information (i.e., multimodal graphs, MMGs) is essential for real-world applications such as social networks, healthcare, and recommendation systems. Existing MMG learning methods fall into three paradigms based on how they leverage MLLMs: Encoder, Aligner, and Predictor. MLLM-as-Encoder focuses on enhancing graph neural networks (GNNs) via multimodal feature fusion; MLLM-as-Aligner aligns multimodal attributes in language or hidden space to enable LLM-based graph reasoning; MLLM-as-Predictor treats MLLMs as standalone reasoners with in-context learning or fine-tuning. Despite their advances, the MMG field lacks a unified benchmark to fairly evaluate across these approaches, making it unclear what progress has been made. To bridge this gap, we present Graph-MLLM, a comprehensive benchmark for multimodal graph learning by systematically evaluating these three paradigms across six datasets with different domains. Through extensive experiments, we observe that jointly considering the visual and textual attributes of the nodes benefits graph learning, even when using pre-trained text-to-image alignment models (e.g., CLIP) as encoders. We also find that converting visual attributes into textual descriptions further improves performance compared to directly using visual inputs. Moreover, we observe that fine-tuning MLLMs on specific MMGs can achieve state-of-the-art results in most scenarios, even without explicit graph structure information. We hope that our open-sourced library will facilitate rapid, equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative research in this field.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |

Various representation learning methods have been developed, including graph-based approaches for relationships among entities, sequence-based methods for capturing the temporal evolution of user activities, and content-based models for leveraging text and visual content. However, the development of a unifying framework that integrates these diverse techniques to support multiple applications remains a significant challenge. This paper presents OmniSage, a large-scale representation framework that learns universal representations for a variety of applications at Pinterest. OmniSage integrates graph neural networks with content-based models and user sequence models by employing multiple contrastive learning tasks to effectively process graph data, user sequence data, and content signals. To support the training and inference of OmniSage, we developed an efficient infrastructure capable of supporting Pinterest graphs with billions of nodes. The universal representations generated by OmniSage have significantly enhanced user experiences on Pinterest, leading to an approximate 2.5% increase in sitewide repins (saves) across five applications.

KANs have been integrated into various deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks, and transformers, with their performance evaluated. However, their effectiveness within point-cloud-based neural networks remains unexplored. To address this gap, we incorporate KANs into PointNet for the first time to evaluate their performance on 3D point cloud classification and segmentation tasks. Specifically, we introduce PointNet-KAN, built upon two key components. First, it employs KANs instead of traditional MLPs. Second, it retains the core principle of PointNet by using shared KAN layers and applying symmetric functions for global feature extraction, ensuring permutation invariance with respect to the input features. In traditional MLPs, the goal is to train the weights and biases with fixed activation functions; however, in KANs, the goal is to train the activation functions themselves. We use Jacobi polynomials to construct the KAN layers. We extensively and systematically evaluate PointNet-KAN across various polynomial degrees and special types such as the Lagrange, Chebyshev, and Gegenbauer polynomials. Our results show that PointNet-KAN achieves competitive performance compared to PointNet with MLPs on benchmark datasets for 3D object classification and part and semantic segmentation, despite employing a shallower and simpler network architecture. We also study a hybrid PointNet model incorporating both KAN and MLP layers. We hope this work serves as a foundation and provides guidance for integrating KANs, as an alternative to MLPs, into more advanced point cloud processing architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structural-Spectral Graph Convolution with Evidential Edge Learning for Hyperspectral Image Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09920v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering assigns similar pixels to the same class without any annotations, which is an important yet challenging task. For large-scale HSIs, most methods rely on superpixel segmentation and perform superpixel-level clustering based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing GNNs cannot fully exploit the spectral information of the input HSI, and the inaccurate superpixel topological graph may lead to the confusion of different class semantics during information aggregation. To address these challenges, we first propose a structural-spectral graph convolutional operator (SSGCO) tailored for graph-structured HSI superpixels to improve their representation quality through the co-extraction of spatial and spectral features. Second, we propose an evidence-guided adaptive edge learning (EGAEL) module that adaptively predicts and refines edge weights in the superpixel topological graph. We integrate the proposed method into a contrastive learning framework to achieve clustering, where representation learning and clustering are simultaneously conducted. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves clustering accuracy by 2.61%, 6.06%, 4.96% and 3.15% over the best compared methods on four HSI datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/jhqi/SSGCO-EGAEL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guided Graph Compression for Quantum Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09862v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective for processing graph-structured data but face challenges with large graphs due to high memory requirements and inefficient sparse matrix operations on GPUs. Quantum Computing (QC) offers a promising avenue to address these issues and inspires new algorithmic approaches. In particular, Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs) have been explored in recent literature. However, current quantum hardware limits the dimension of the data that can be effectively encoded. Existing approaches either simplify datasets manually or use artificial graph datasets. This work introduces the Guided Graph Compression (GGC) framework, which uses a graph autoencoder to reduce both the number of nodes and the dimensionality of node features. The compression is guided to enhance the performance of a downstream classification task, which can be applied either with a quantum or a classical classifier. The framework is evaluated on the Jet Tagging task, a classification problem of fundamental importance in high energy physics that involves distinguishing particle jets initiated by quarks from those by gluons. The GGC is compared against using the autoencoder as a standalone preprocessing step and against a baseline classical GNN classifier. Our numerical results demonstrate that GGC outperforms both alternatives, while also facilitating the testing of novel QGNN ansatzes on realistic datasets.</p></details> |  |

Our approach leverages a graph neural network trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to efficiently estimate the robot's cost-to-go, formulated as local goal recommendations. A spatio-temporal path-searching module, which accounts for kinematic constraints, is then employed to generate a reference trajectory to facilitate solving the non-convex optimization problem used for explicit constraint enforcement. More importantly, we introduce an incremental action-masking mechanism and a privileged learning strategy, enabling end-to-end training of the proposed planner. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively addresses local planning in complex dynamic environments, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Compared with existing learning-optimization hybrid methods, our approach eliminates the dependency on high-fidelity simulation environments, offering significant advantages in computational efficiency and training scalability. The code will be released as open-source upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  |
